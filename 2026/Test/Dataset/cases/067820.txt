Muldoon, J.
: In this combined litigation the plaintiffs assert that subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, is ultra vires of Parliament, and that Regulations C.01.014 to C.01.014.4 inclusive, C.R.C. 1978, c. 870, amended by SOR/81-248, Can. Gazette, Part II, April 8, 1981, p. 1022, and Regulations C.08.001 to C.08.011 inclusive, C.R.C. 1978, c. 870 as amended by SOR/79-236, Can. Gazette, Part II, March 29, 1979, p. 988 are all also ultra vires if not of Parliament then of the Governor General in Council. The above mentioned Regulations are alleged, consequently, to be null and void in that:
a) they constitute a licensing scheme not authorized by the powers to make Regulations under section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act (hereinafter, the Act);
b) they are not Regulations at all since they contain no objective standards for the criteria for (i) the definition of a new drug, (ii) the issuance of notice of compliance by the Minister, (iii) the issuance of a "drug identification number" (hereinafter, DIN);
c) they constitute (or are an expression of) an illegal delegation of authority;
d) they constitute an illegal delegation of discretion to the Director (the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Health and Welfare) which discretion has been exercised in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner by his employees ((sic) or subordinate personnel); and
e) they leave the effect of constituting the Director a court by reason of the fact that they purport to give him the power to determine what constitutes a violation of the Act or its Regulations.
In regard to the foregoing, the plaintiffs seek declaratory relief.
[2]
The plaintiff, C.E. Jamieson & Co. (Dominion) Ltd., hereinafter Jamieson, asserts also that the search on its premises for and seizure of all isolated amino acids and all amino acid products in its inventory on December 17, 1984, by the Director's personnel were and are illegal, null and void, in particular in that they were unreasonable and contravene section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The plaintiffs assert that, in any event, the said isolated amino acids and amino acid products are not "new drugs" within the meaning of the Act and Regulations.
[3]
Finally, and in the ultimate alternative the plaintiffs allege that even if the above mentioned Regulations be not ultra vires, the manner in which they have been applied viz-à-viz the plaintiffs is unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory to the point of creating a flagrant injustice, and that in particular Jamieson is entitled to receive a DIN for its product.
[4]
In this latter regard Jamieson seeks, in effect, an order in the nature of mandamus commanding the Director to issue a DIN for its product "Stress Ease with Vitamins and Minerals". In fact, the parties now agree that the Director and his staff withdrew their objection to Jamieson's proposed trade name Stress-Ease, after the institution of these present proceedings. While the Director did not withdraw his objection to the inclusion of L-tryptophan in the product, he did approve the issuance of a DIN for a product, without tryptophan, under the trade name, STRESS-EASE.
[5]
These two cases came to trial simultaneously on December 16, 17 and 18, 1986,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Québec. The exhibits are voluminous, most being entered in each action, and the parties' joint statements of agreed facts, one entered in each action, are complex. Finally settled pleadings were introduced and certified records amended by nunc pro tunc order, with the consent of counsel on both sides, only at the opening of the simultaneous trials, and the requisite amended form of statement of defence in action no. T-2853-84 was filed in January, 1987. Written submissions were received also in that month. Transcripts of the proceedings were also obtained.
[6]
The parties' amended joint admissions of facts and their written additional admissions, including documents adopted therein by reference, are no doubt uppermost in the parties' minds in each action and in every detail and so it is unnecessary to repeat or recite them here. Needless to emphasize in adversarial civil litigation such as this is, albeit concerned with important issues of public law, the Court will ordinarily accept and adopt the facts which the adversaries present by agreement.
[7]
In addition to the agreed written evidence, the plaintiffs called five witnesses to present viva voce testimony. They are: Eric Margolis, Chief Executive Officer of the plaintiff, Jamieson; James Allan Maranda, President of the plaintiff Swiss Herbal Remedies; Barrie Carlson, President of Ouest Vitamin Supplies Limited; Errol Abramson, owner of BEA per Capita Corporation, a British-Columbia-based vitamin packager and retailer; and Hyman Busgang, President and owner of the plaintiff, Pharmetics. Counsel for the defendants cross-examined only Mr. Margolis, and he did not call any witnesses to testify viva voce at trial for the defence.
[8]
For the defence there was tendered by plaintiffs' counsel, as exhibit 2 in both actions, the affidavit of Simon N. Young, Ph.D. an expert who, with the consent of both sides, was not called to testify at the trial. A transcript of the cross-examination of Prof. Young by plaintiffs' counsel, held on December 11, 1986, is exhibit 3 in both actions. Various substances in tablets, sachets and capsules were identified during that cross-examination and they are received as exhibits 3(SY1) through 3(SY8) in both actions.
Extracts from the transcripts of the examinations by the plaintiffs' counsel for discovery of defendants' officials, Denys Cook and Robert Ferrier are together exhibit 4.
[9]
In all, twenty major exhibits are filed herein, three en liasse and several being documents of as many as six pages. The documentary evidence tendered is voluminous, highly detailed and rather technical in general.
[10]
On their part, the defendants rely on the statement of admissions and the supplementary documents produced as and with exhibit 1, the affidavit of Prof. Simon N. Young (ex. 2) and the transcript of his cross-examination thereon (ex. 3) and exhibit 10 (en liasse) the notice of compliance dated October 6, 1986, and product monograph ICN Canada Ltd. of September 2, 1986. (Transcript 1, p. 137.)
ISSUES
[11]
The facts and the pleadings raise a number of administrative law and constitutional law issues. These will be examined in the order of sine qua non, starting with the issue of legislative competence under the division of powers as to the vires of Parliament to legislate and to delegate legislative authority in the matter of food and drugs. The issues, then, are the following:
I.
Legislative Competence
: Are subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Food and Drugs Act and the Regulations regarding new drugs ultra vires or intra vires of Parliament?
II.
Subordinate Legislative Competence
: Are the DIN Regulations and/or the new-drug Regulations ultra vires the Governor General in Council for any of the following asserted reasons:
A. They constitute a licensing scheme not authorized by section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act;
B. They establish no objective standards and are too vague; and/or
C. They constitute or are an expression of an illegal subdelegation of authority?
III. Were the isolated amino acids and amino acid products truly "new drugs" in contemplation of the Act and the Regulations?
IV. Were the Regulations regarding new drugs applied in an unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory manner?
V.
Charter Application
: Did the search and seizure pursuant to section 22 of the Food and Drugs Act, violate the plaintiffs' right guaranteed by section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and is that section 22 itself violative of such right?
The determination of the foregoing issues will provide the definitive outcome of this litigation.
I.
PARLIAMENT'S LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE: Are subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Food and Drugs Act and the Regulations regarding new drugs ultra vires or intra vires of Parliament?
[12]
This question demands a resolution of constitutional division of powers and that resolution is the sine qua non of this litigation. It is such, because if the statutory enactment upon which the Regulations depend be beyond Parliament's constitutional powers, then the Regulations will fall for lack of a legal base and the plaintiffs will be able - and will have been able - to pursue their activities free of regulatory constraint on the part of the Parliament and government of Canada. On the other hand, if the statutory enactment be valid, one must still consider whether the actual Regulations be a proper exercise of the powers conferred on the Governor in Council and, if so, whether the state's functionaries have applied and enforced them lawfully. If the regulations be invalidly formulated and promulgated then the enquiry will stop upon such a finding.
[13]
The plaintiffs submit that the statutory provision, subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Act, cannot be supported by Parliament's exclusive power to make laws in relation to all matters within the subjects of "trade and commerce" or "criminal law", nor yet by the general jurisdiction to make laws for the peace, order and good government [p.o. & g.g.] of Canada". The first mentioned field of jurisdiction resides in Head 2 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, the second resides in Head 27 of section 91 and the general power, last mentioned finds its origin in the Constitution's basic grant of Parliament's power expressed in the opening words of section 91.
[14]
In addition to that panoramic assertion of lack of jurisdiction, the plaintiffs further assert that such an enactment must come within, because it infringes, the provincial jurisdiction to make laws exclusively in relation to matters within the class of subject which is "property and civil rights of the province" which might enact such laws or decline to do so. The provincial jurisdiction resides in Head 13 of section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. In this litigation the plaintiffs alone carry the burden of such persuasion, unaided by any provincial attorney general because none was represented in these proceedings.
[15]
In response, the defendant submits that the impugned provision of the Food and Drugs Act, with the supporting provisions generally of the Act itself, is validly enacted by Parliament pursuant to its powers under section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, particularly the power to make laws in relation to criminal law and/or p.o. & g.g.
[16]
Judicial review of legislation in the context of the constitutional division of powers is theoretically a two-step sequence: first, a determination of the pith and substance (that is, dominant subject matter) of the legislation; and then the assignment of that subject matter to one of the heads of power (that is, classes of subjects) listed in and distributed by sections 91 and 92 (inter alia) of the constitutional statute. Those two steps frequently fuse because determination of the pith and substance is often expressed as one or more of the heads of power to legislate.
[17]
There is more to the question of power to legislate than resides only in subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the principal enactment. The form and purpose or thrust of the Act and its Regulations are to be considered. Because the Act in form does not contain any preamble to state its legislative intent, the same must be inferred from its provisions. Certain of the interpretive definitions are worth reciting, thus:
"'department' means the Department of National Health and Welfare; [and 'Minister' of course bears the correlative meaning];
"'drug' includes any substance or mixture of substances manufactured, sold or represented for use in
(a) the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease, disorder, abnormal physical state, or the symptoms thereof in man or animal,
(b) restoring, correcting or modifying organic functions in man or animal, or
(c) disinfection in premises in which food is manufactured, prepared or kept;
"'inspector' means any person designated as an inspector under section 21.1 or pursuant to the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs Act for the purpose of the enforcement of this Act.
"'label' includes any legend, word or mark attached to, included in, belonging to or accompanying any food, drug, cosmetic, device or package;
"'package' includes anything in which any food, drug, cosmetic or device is wholly or partly contained, placed or packed;
"'prescribed' means prescribed by the regulations;
"'sell' includes sell, offer for sale, expose for sale, have in possession for sale, and distribute;"
[18]
Part I of the Food and Drugs Act bears the title "Foods, Drugs, Cosmetics and Devices". This part commences with a general provision:
"General
"3(1) No person shall advertise any food, drug, cosmetic or device to the general public as a treatment, preventative or cure for any of the diseases, disorders or abnormal physical states mentioned in Schedule A.
"3(2) No person shall sell any food, drug, cosmetic or device
(a) that is represented by label, or
(b) that he advertises to the general public
as a treatment, preventative or cure for any of the diseases, disorders or abnormal physical states mentioned in Schedule A.
"3(3) Except as authorized by regulation, no person shall advertise to the general public any contraceptive device or any drug manufactured, sold or represented for use in the prevention of conception."
Under its next heading "Food", there are four further sections which, like section 3, having regard to section 26 under "Penalties", create offences being the sale of poisonous or harmful substances, food unfit for human consumption, rotten, decomposed or adulterated food and the like. Labelling, packaging, selling or advertising any food in a false, misleading or deceptive manner, or likely creating a false impression about its character, value, merit or safety and the like are all prohibited. Unsanitary conditions for food are likewise prohibited.
[19]
That division of Part I entitled "Drugs" is more elaborate than the foregoing but is largely modelled on the offences and prohibitions expressed under "Food". In the circumstances, it is worth reciting in detail, so:
"Drugs
"8. No person shall sell any drug that
(a) was manufactured, prepared, preserved, packed or stored under unsanitary conditions; or
(b) is adulterated.
"9(1) No person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any drug in a manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety.
"9(2) A drug that is not labelled or packaged as required by the regulations, or is labelled or packaged contrary to the regulations, shall be deemed to be labelled or packaged contrary to subsection (1).
"10(1) Where a standard has been prescribed for a drug, no person shall label, package, sell or advertise any substance in such a manner that it is likely to be mistaken for such drug, unless the substance complies with the prescribed standard.
"10(2) Where a standard has not been prescribed for a drug, but a standard for the drug is contained in any publication mentioned in Schedule B, no person shall label, package, sell or advertise any substance in such a manner that it is likely to be mistaken for such drug, unless the substance complies with such standard.
"10(3) Where a standard for a drug has not been prescribed and no standard for the drug is contained in any publication mentioned in Schedule B, no person shall sell such drug, unless
(a) it is in accordance with the professed standard under which it is sold, and
(b) it does not resemble, in a manner likely to deceive, any drug for which a standard has been prescribed or is contained in any publication mentioned in Schedule B.
"11. No person shall manufacture, prepare, preserve, package or store for sale any drug under unsanitary conditions.
"12. No person shall sell any drug described in Schedule C or D unless the Minister has, in prescribed form and manner, indicated that the premises in which the drug was manufactured and the process and conditions of manufacture therein are suitable to ensure that the drug will not be unsafe for use.
"13. No person shall sell any drug described in Schedule E unless the Minister has, in prescribed form and manner, indicated that the batch from which the drug was taken is not unsafe for use.
"14(1) No person shall distribute or cause to be distributed any drug as a sample.
"14(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the distribution, under prescribed conditions, of samples of drugs to physicians, dentists, veterinary surgeons or pharmacists.
"15. No person shall sell any drug described in Schedule F. [Schedule revoked July 18, 1984]."
[20]
Part II of the Act bearing the title, "Administration and Enforcement" deals with inspectors, search and seizure, forfeiture, analysis of articles and substances, Regulations (including the impugned provision), penalties and evidence. In terms of characterizing Parliament's legislative competence in regard to the enactment of the Food and Drugs Act from the point of view of international trade and commerce, Part II ends with a most telling section. It runs under the title, "Exports", thus:
"32. This Act does not apply to any packaged food, drug (other than a drug or other substance defined as a controlled drug by Part III or as a restricted drug by Part IV), cosmetic or device, not manufactured for consumption in Canada and not sold for consumption in Canada, if the package is marked in distinct overprinting with the word 'Export', and a certificate that the package and its contents do not contravene any known requirement of the law of the country to which it is or is about to be consigned, has been issued in respect thereof in prescribed form and manner."
[21]
Schedule A is a list of some 46 conditions and diseases, mental and physical, alphabetically arranged, from alcoholism, through anxiety, depression, obesity and pleurisy, among others, to vaginitis and venereal disease. Schedule B is a list of seven well known formularies and pharmacopoeiae. Schedule C covers radiopharmaceuticals, and D is a list of natural and organic substances and secretions. Schedule E is blank, and F was revoked in July, 1984.
[22]
By virtue of section 32, above cited, the compass of the Food and Drugs Act operates only in and throughout Canada, with an exception provided in regard to the labelling of drugs manufactured for consumption outside of Canada. The exception is not in issue here. Therefore it is within the sole optic of a statute enacted and promulgated by Parliament in and for Canada that the plaintiffs attack the vires of the impugned subparagraph:
"25(1) The Governor in Council may make Regulations for carrying the purposes and provisions of this Act into effect, and, in particular, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing, may make Regulations
. . . . .
(o) respecting
(ii) the sale or the conditions of sale of any new drug, and defining for the purposes of this Act the expression 'new drug';"
[23]
Paragraph 25(1)(o) is enacted in the context of that section of the Act which declares at least one legislative intent of the statute, and expresses a purpose which is closely connected with the impugned provision. The other, closely connected part is paragraph 25(1)(b), among others. In context, then, the impugned subparagraph is part of a legislative schema which runs, at least partially, thus:
"25(1) The Governor in Council may make Regulations for carrying the purposes and provisions of this Act into effect, and, in particular, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing, may make Regulations
. . . . .
(b) respecting
(i) the
labelling and packaging
and the offering, exposing and advertising for sale of food, drugs, cosmetics and devices,
(ii) the size, dimensions, fill and other specifications of packages of food, drugs, cosmetics and devices.
(iii) the sale or the condition of sale of any food, drug, cosmetic or device, and
(iv) the
use of any substance as an ingredient
in any food, drug, cosmetic or device,
to prevent the consumer or purchaser thereof from being deceived of misled
as to its design, construction, performance, intended use, quantity, character, value, composition, merit or safety, or to
prevent injury to the health of the consumer or purchaser.
. . . . .
(e) respecting the method of preparation, manufacture, preserving, packing, storing and testing of any food, drug, cosmetic or device
in the interest of, or for the prevention of injury to, the health of the consumer or purchaser;
. . . . .
(m) adding anything to any of the Schedules,
in the interest of, or for the prevention of injury to, the health of the consumer or purchaser,
or deleting anything therefrom;
. . . . .
(o) respecting
(i) the method of
preparation, manufacture, preserving, packing, labelling, storing and testing
of any new drug, and
(ii) the sale or the condition of sale of any new drug, and
defining for the purposes of this Act
the expression 'new drug';" (emphasis not in original text)
In order to understand the pith and substance of the impugned subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii), it is essential to ascertain the legislative intent and purpose of the provision in its proper context. The context of this provision which confers on the Governor in Council the power to make Regulations for carrying the purposes of the Act into effect reveals a legislative intent which is manifest in sections 8, 9(1), 10(1) and (2), 11, 12, 13, 26, 27, 28, 29 and in subparagraphs 25(1)(b), (e) and (m). The statutory authority to make Regulations respecting drugs generally, and new drugs in particular, must stand or fall in this constitutional and legislative context.
[24]
Early on in the Regulations, there are the DIN provisions of which the plaintiffs complain and which they seek to have declared ultra vires of Parliament and of the Governor in Council in terms of the scope and reach of the Food and Drugs Act. They are Regulations C.01.014 to C.01.014.4 which may conveniently be either quoted or paraphrased thus:
"C.01.014(1) No manufacturer shall sell a drug in dosage form unless a drug identification number has been assigned for that drug and the assignment of the number has not been cancelled pursuant to section C.01. 014.6.
"(2) Subsection (1) does not apply where the drug is a radiopharmaceutical, a sensitivity disc or a sensitivity tablet.
"C.01.014.1 Any manufacturer or importer may apply for a DIN, which shall be made to the Director in writing and shall set out specified matters (a) to (n), such as: the pharmaceutical form in which the drug is to be sold: the recommended route of administration; quantitatively the medicinal ingredients by their proper, or at least common names; whether sold for human or veterinary use, or for disinfection of premises; name and quantity of each colouring which is not a medicinal ingredient; the use or purpose for which the drug is recommended; recommended dosage; identification of the manufacturer or importer; and the text of all labels and package inserts and of any further prescribing information stated to be available on request. In the case of a new drug, a submission filed under C.08.002, or in the case of a proprietary medicine an application under C.10.003, is deemed to be an application for a DIN.
"C.01.014.2 Where an applicant has provided all the information required in respect of a drug, the Director shall issue 'a document' setting out the DIN and recording the information referred to in C.01.014.1(2)(a) to (f), but where the Director believes on reasonable grounds that the product is not a drug, or, is a drug but its sale [sic] (ingestion, surely) would cause injury to the health of the consumer or purchaser or would violate the Act or regulations, he may refuse to issue that 'document'. If so, the applicant may submit additional information and ask the Director to reconsider, that which the latter shall do.
"C.01.014.3 The applicant or a person authorized by the applicant shall, within 30 days after he commences sale of a drug, date and sign the document issued pursuant to section C.01.014.2 in respect of the drug and return the document
(a) with a confirmation that the information recorded therein is correct;
(b) indicating the date on which the drug was first sold in Canada; and
(c) accompanied by samples or facsimiles of all labels and package inserts and any further prescribing information stated to be available on request.
"C.01.014.4 Where an application in respect of a drug is made under section C.01.014.1 and the information set out in the application is no longer correct due to a change in the subject matter of that information,
(a) in the case of a change in the subject matter of any of the information referred to in paragraphs C.01.014.1(2)(a) to (e)
(i) that occurs prior to the sale of the drug, a new application shall be made, or
(ii) that occurs after the sale of the drug, no further sale of the drug shall be made until a new application for a drug identification number in respect of that drug is made and a number is assigned; and
(b) in the case of a change in the subject matter of any of the information referred to in paragraphs C.01.014.1(2)(f) to (k)
(i) that occurs prior to the sale of the drug, the particulars of the change shall be submitted with the return of the document referred to in section C.01.014. 3, or
(ii) that occurs after the sale of the drug, the person to whom the drug identification number in respect of that drug was issued shall, within 30 days of the change, inform the Director of the change."
The heart of the plaintiffs' complaint is the alleged vagueness of section C.01.014.2, paraphrased above.
[25]
The "new drug" Regulations of which the plaintiffs complain are promulgated in Division 8 of the Regulations. It begins with a definition of New Drugs, thus
"C.08.001 For the purposes of the Act and this Division 'New Drug' means
(a) a drug that contains or consists of a substance, whether as an active or inactive ingredient, carrier, coating, excipient, menstruum or other component, that has not been sold as a drug in Canada for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada the safety and effectiveness of that substance for use as a drug;
(b) a drug that is a combination of two or more drugs, with or without other ingredients, and that has not been sold in that combination or in the proportion in which those drugs are combined in that drug, for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada the safety and effectiveness of that combination and proportion for use as a drug; or
(c) a drug, with respect to which the manufacturer prescribes, recommends, proposes or claims a use as a drug, or a condition of use as a drug, including dosage, route of administration, or duration of action and that has not been sold for that use or condition of use in Canada, for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada the safety and effectiveness of that use or condition of use of that drug."
[26]
The remainder of the impugned Regulations in Division 8 are voluminous, and this exercise of characterizing them - C.08.002 through C.08.011 - in terms of constitutional vires, can be adequately served by a paraphrased brief summary.
"C.08.002 - provides that no person shall sell a new drug unless the manufacturer has filed with the Minister a new drug submission and obtained a notice of compliance; lists the information which a new drug submission must include.
"C.08.003 - in effect provides that if any of the information contained in the new drug submission differs from the actual selling practices of that new drug, the new drug shall not be sold unless the manufacturer files with the Minister a supplement to the new drug submission containing such information and material as the Director may require.
"C.08.004 - requires the Minister to issue a notice of compliance within 120 days where the new drug submission complies with C.08.002 or C.08.003.
"C.08.005 - lists the circumstances under which a manufacturer may sell a new drug to "qualified investigators" for the sole purpose of clinical testing to obtain evidence about its safety, dosage and effectiveness, notwithstanding section C.08.002 or C.08.003.
"C.08.006 - authorizes the Minister to suspend a notice of compliance where doing so is, in his or her opinion, in the interests of public health, where the effectiveness of the new drug is now questionable, or where the new drug submission has been found to have been based upon any untrue statement of material fact.
"C.08.007 - requires a manufacturer, who has obtained a notice of compliance, to maintain adequately organized records of current scientific research concerning the new drug, and of actual selling and consumption practices of the new drug.
"C.08.008 - prohibits manufacturers from selling new drugs unless they have complied with C.08.007.
"C.08.009 - sets out the procedure to be followed when the Minister suspends a notice of compliance.
"C.08.010 - provides for the sale, on the Director's authorization, of a new drug to a medical practitioner for emergency treatment.
"C.08.011 - permits a manufacturer to make a C.08.010 type of sale, and exempts such a sale from the provisions of the Act and Regulations. "
I(1): Trade and Commerce
[27]
The defendants' counsel rightly did not rely heavily upon this head of Parliament's power. It can be dealt with quite briefly.
[28]
Head 2 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, confers upon Parliament the exclusive legislative authority to make laws in regard to that class of subject designated as the regulation of trade and commerce. The apparently broad scope of this power has been restrictively limited by judicial interpretation. The decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  political arrangements in regard to trade requiring the sanction of Parliament, regulation of interprovincial trade and perhaps regulation of trade affecting the whole country, but does not comprehend the regulation by legislation of the contracts of a particular business or trade in a single province. Here, Parliament purports to regulate the business of the pharmaceutical industry within Canada. However, it is not acceptable that it may lawfully do so, absent an emergency, even though the industry operates and the legislation applies throughout the country. Such a conclusion on the trade and commerce power may be taken, inter alia, from a selection of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council over a fair span of years in: In re Insurance Act, 1910 (1913), 48 S.C.R. 260; In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, [1922] 1 A.C. 191; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 7 N.R. 477.
[29]
Conceding that the Food and Drugs Act is regulatory legislation (transcript 3, pp. 91 & 92), the defendants' counsel argued simply that it rests, in part, on the trade-and-commerce power, being "justifiable as regulation as a general matter of trade of interest to the Dominion", (transcript 3, p. 123). He submitted nothing more on the subject of that power as a foundation for this legislation.
[30]
Some support for invocation of the trade-and-commerce power might be inferred from the minority judgments in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There Messrs. Justices Beetz and Lamer expressed themselves (p. 282 S.C.R.) to be in substantial agreement with Mr. Justice Dickson (now Chief Justice), to the effect that paragraph 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act was validly enacted by Parliament under its authority to make laws in relation to trade and commerce pursuant to Head 2 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Dickson, J., is reported, at pages 267 and 268 S.C.R., to have made these observations, which may bear some relevance to the instant circumstances.
"In approaching this difficult problem of characterization it is useful to note the remarks of the Chief Justice in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  general trade and commerce power the
presence of a national regulatory scheme
, the oversight of a
regulatory agency
and a concern with trade in general rather than with an aspect of a particular business. To this list I would add what to my mind would be even stronger indications of valid general regulation of trade and commerce, namely (i) that the provinces jointly or severally would be constitutionally incapable of passing such an enactment and (ii) that failure to include one or more provinces or localities would jeopardize successful operation in other parts of the country.
"The above does not purport to be an exhaustive list, nor is the presence of any or all of these indicia necessarily decisive. The proper approach to the characterization is still the one suggested  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a careful case by case assessment. Nevertheless, the presence of such factors does at least make it far more probable that what is being addressed in a federal enactment is genuinely a national economic concern and not just a collection of local ones." (Emphasis not in original text.)
These thoughts do not, of course, contemplate the exact circumstances of the case at bar, but they do not overbear the defendants' concession about the regulatory character of the Food and Drugs Act. Of interest here are the comprehensive reasons of MacGuigan, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), in which his colleagues concurred.
[31]
Although they may have some incidental effect on international and interprovincial trade and commerce the statutory delegation and the consequent Regulations are not aimed directly at such trade and commerce. Thus, they are not sustainable on that branch of the power. Further, since the Act and Regulations are directed by Parliament toward the regulation of a single (albeit multifarious) industry - pharmaceuticals - they reside outside the regulation of trade, in its megascopic sense, affecting the whole country. The Court therefore concludes that the delegation of regulationmaking authority expressed in subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) with its companion provisions, and the impugned Regulations purportedly made pursuant thereto, cannot be sustained by Parliament's authority to legislate in regard to the regulation of trade and commerce within the meaning of Head 2, section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867.
I(2): Criminal law
[32]
Head 27 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 accords to Parliament the jurisdiction to enact statutes in relation to "the criminal law ... including the procedure in criminal [law] matters".
[33]
Criminal law's essence, as seen in 1976 by the Law Reform Commission of Canada in its Report 3: Our Criminal Law, was described thus:
"Criminal law, then, primarily has to do with values. Naturally, for crime itself is nothing more nor less than conduct seriously contrary to our values. Crimes are acts not only punishable by law but also
meriting
punishment. As Fitzjames Stephen said, the ordinary citizen views crime as an act 'forbidden by law and revolting to the moral sentiments of society'. Crimes are not just forbidden, they are also wrong."
[34]
Jurisprudence offers this much, at least, in general description of criminal law:
"A statutory prohibition of defined conduct with penal consequences, which prohibition safeguards the public interest by excluding substances injurious to health, by denouncing fraud, deception and other injurious exploitation and by promoting peace, order and security."
That concocted definition, general as it is, is drawn from various judicial pronouncements among which not least are,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 324, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at pp. 196 & 197. Indeed, in the last mentioned case, it was specifically stated that the argument to the effect that Parliament's ban on margarine was an enactment of criminal law, "would have had more weight if it had been possible to contend that the object of the prohibition was to
exclude
from Canada
substances injurious to health
". (Emphasis added.) See, also, the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff, in the Supreme Court of Canada in Re Combines Investigation Act, [1922] 2 D.L.R. 802, at p. 805, in regard to the control of human conduct being a concern of the criminal law.
[35]
The pertinent passages of the Food and Drugs Act above quoted, demonstrate that the prohibited conducts at which they are aimed are the dissemination of substances injurious to health, and the misleading or deception of the public in regard to the character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety of drugs, in particular. Penal consequences for such conduct are provided by section 26 of the Act.
[36]
The defendants submit that the exclusion and prohibition of injurious substances, and the establishment of standards for permissible substances serve the purposes of criminal law, to the end of protecting public health and preventing the dangers of deceiving or misleading the public about the potential risks associated even with the permissible substances. Any effect on property and civil rights is merely incidental, say the defendants. The plaintiffs disagree. They argue that, in essence, these enactments do not prohibit conduct but, rather, regulate a business. Accordingly, the plaintiffs urge, this is colourable legislation which really bears on property and civil rights in a (if not every) province, not criminal law.
[37]
The constitutional validity of various provisions of the Food and Drugs Act has been challenged in litigation on at least four previous occasions.
[38]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), with the scholarly addendum of Martin, J.A., reported in [1934] 1 D.L.R. 706, the validity of provisions prohibiting the adulteration of food with certain preservatives was under attack. The court unanimously held that the subject resides squarely within Parliament's legislative jurisdiction over criminal law. The appeal lay from the judgment of Macdonald, J. Macdonald, J.A., wrote for himself and Macdonald, C.J.B.C., thus:
"So ... if the Federal Parliament, to protect the public health against actual or threatened danger, places restrictions on, and limits the number of preservatives that may be used, it may do so under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act. This is not in essence an interference with property and civil rights. That may follow as an incident but the real purpose (not colourable and not merely to aid what in substance is an encroachment) is to prevent actual, or threatened injury or the likelihood of injury of the most serious kind to all the inhabitants of the Dominion." (p. 506)
Continuing, on page 507, Macdonald, J.A., is further reported as holding:
"The primary object of this legislation is the public safety - protecting it from threatened injury. If that is its main purpose - and not a mere pretence for the invasion of civil rights - it is none the less valid because it may be open to a criticism, from which few acts are free, that its purpose would be served equally well by accepting the opinion of others, viz., that sulphur dioxide might with safety be added to the list of usable preservatives. Tampering with food by the introduction of foreign matter, however good the intentions, should properly be regarded as a public evil and it may properly be regarded as highly dangerous to lower the bars, or to remove restrictions which, rightly or wrongly, Parliament in its wisdom thought fit to prescribe."
[39]
The immediately preceding pronouncement has stood unimpaired during more than half a century. It certainly buttresses the defendants' posture on the issues of the prescribing of standards, considerations of danger, and "newness" in regard to the plaintiffs' substances. It also indicates that such factors do not adversely affect the issue of constitutional validity.
[40]
Beyond the matter of public safety, Macdonald, J.A., held that the Act's validity is sustainable on yet another ground, suppression of fraud in the distribution of food products, in that instance, where a dealer misrepresented the adulterated sausages as being "fresh". Obviously, drugs and other substances cannot escape the force of such reasoning.
[41]
The reasoning and conclusions stated in the Standard Sausage were adopted and applied by Mr. Justice Heald, then of the Trial Division of this Court in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Heald, J., held that paragraph 4(d) of the Act, pursuant to which cyclamates were to be phased out and banned for use in canned foods, is intra vires of Parliament. He is reported, at page 95, as saying:
"A comparison of the 1927 Act with the present Act clearly shows that, while some provisions have been added and others changed, the main purposes of the Act have not changed over the years. Thus, the rationale of the Standard Sausage case (supra) applies equally to the present case.
"An apt description of the criminal law power of the Parliament of Canada is contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Rand in The Reference as to the Validity of Section 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1, at p. 50, where he said:
'Is the prohibition then enacted with a view to a public purpose which can support it as being in relation to criminal law? Public peace, order, security,
health
, morality: these are the ordinary though not exclusive ends served by that law ...'" (Underlining mine).
[42]
More recently, the Supreme Court of Canada has twice considered the constitutional validity of certain provisions in the Food and Drugs Act, which were invalidated in one instance and sustained in the other. Both decisions are closely reasoned, although neither was unanimous.
[43]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court considered the impugned validity of a regulation made pursuant to the Act, which regulation prescribed the compositional standards of "beer" and "light beer". The appellant had marketed a new brand of beer labelled "Labatt's Special Lite", which contained 4% alcohol by volume. The regulation in question exacted that "light beer" contain not more than 2.5% alcohol, whereas regular "beer" was required to have only between 2.6% and 5.5% alcohol by volume. The brewery's appeal was allowed by a majority of six of the nine judges. Of that majority, five judges speaking through the voice and words of Mr. Justice Estey, did set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the order of the Trial Division and declared:
"that sections B.02.130 to B.02.135 inclusive of the Food and Drug Regulations are invalid and that sections 6 and 25(1)(c) of the Food and Drugs Act are ultra vires Parliament in so far as they relate to malt liquors."
Mr. Justice Pratte, the sixth judge of the majority joined in allowing the brewery's appeal, but would simply have restored the judgment of the trial judge.
[44]
In that Labatt Breweries case, Estey, J., held that the regulation had no criminal law purpose. Health protection could be its purpose since, adopting the appellant's submission, as Estey, J., did, (at p. 934 S.C.R.): "any such beverage regardless of its name having an alcoholic content by volume of not less than 1.2% and not more than 8.5% [sic] and otherwise brewed in accordance with the process common to all 'Malt Liquors' is presumptively not a hazard to health". Nor was the regulation aimed at the prevention of deception through mislabelling because such, in the context of beer and "light" beer, would arise only
after
the definition and category of "light beer" had been created by statutory regulation. That is, but for the regulation itself, there would have been no issue as to the label since the product did in fact have a volume of alcohol less than the maximum prescribed for regular beer.
[45]
In regard to Parliament's jurisdiction to make laws pursuant to section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, Estey, J., for the majority in the Labatt Breweries case is reported at page 934 S.C.R. as expressing these thoughts:
"The jurisdiction of Parliament in matters related to health similarly has no application here. Parliament may make laws in relation to health for the peace, order and good government of Canada: quarantine laws come to mind as one example. The Privy Council hinted that legislation enacted by Parliament to deal with an 'epidemic of pestilence' would be valid in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . But we are not concerned with such matters here. Where health is an aspect of criminal law, as in the case of adulteration provisions in the statute, the answer is clear but here not helpful."
[46]
A few years later, the Supreme Court upheld other provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. It is pertinent here to note that those provisions are sections 8 and 9, for which penalties for their violation are provided in section 26. In that case,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the majority (Mr. Justice Dickson, now Chief Justice, dissenting), followed the Court's immediately preceding decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Kripps Pharmacy case involved an appeal by the Crown in Right of Canada from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which had dismissed an appeal from a judgment of Berger, J., who in turn had dismissed an application for mandamus requiring County Court Judge Wetmore to proceed with the trial of indictments drawn pursuant to section 26 of the Act.
[47]
The first question posed for the Supreme Court's consideration in that Kripps Pharmacy case asked: "Does the constitutional validity of sections 8(a), 9(1) and 26 of the Food and Drugs Act depend upon section 91(27) of the [Constitution Act]?" Section 26 of the Act enacts that violation of its provisions is an offence triable either summarily or upon indictment, but no mention is made of criminal law as such nor even of the Criminal Code. The late Chief Justice Laskin writing also for Messrs. Justices Ritchie, Estey and McIntyre is reported at pages 288 and 289 [1983] 2 S.C.R., as holding that sections 8 and 9, if not the whole Act, are sustainable by the criminal law power. As well, he speculated that provisions such as section 9 reside also within Parliament's trade-and-commerce powers, although he stopped short of a definitive assertion to that effect. The late Chief Justice then wrote further:
"However, it is unnecessary to pursue this issue and it has been well understood over many years that protection of food and other products against adulteration and to enforce standards of purity are properly assigned to the criminal law.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supplemented by addendum at [1934] 1 D.L.R. 706, is a long standing application of these principles."
Sections 8 and 9, as well as the offence-creating and penalty provisions in section 26 were, again, found to be intra vires of Parliament's authority to enact criminal law - as well as to enforce it in the circumstances.
[48]
In asserting that the Act and Regulations in question here are merely a licensing scheme, the plaintiffs are adopting the words and reasoning of Wetmore, C.C.J., reported at (1980), 114 D.L.R.(3d) 457, at pages 468 and 469. He asserted, as do the plaintiffs, that the impugned Regulations' aim "is not a criminal purpose. In reality, it is a licensing scheme for new drugs and as such is a violation of s. 92(13) and (16) of the British North America Act, 1867. Therefore, the impugned regulation is not a valid exercise of the federal criminal law power". Clearly, that view of the matter is not tenable as a result of the Supreme Court's adjudication of the Kripps Pharmacy case.
[49]
It seems as clear as any notioncan be, that given the constitutional authority to identify and denounce human conduct by enactment of criminal law, Parliament may specifically exempt other, related, conduct from the purview of criminal law by enacting that it is not criminal. It may do so specifically, of course, and by necessary implication. To put the matter in visual terms, it may be said that because Parliament can configure the profile of a crime, it can equally carve out an exception or indentation in that profile such that it does not cover certain defined or implied conduct from the outset or which it previously covered. Again to resort to a familiar element, albeit in a concocted expression, provision for an "offence nisi" may lawfully be enacted by Parliament. That is, to do a certain act intentionally is an offence,
unless
the feasor first, or concurrently or even subsequently complies with a prescribed statutory condition. To procure a miscarriage was long a crime, and it still is - but now there is an exempting condition - the obtaining of a certificate from the therapeutic abortion committee at an accredited or approved hospital pursuant to section 251(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and amendments. That provision has been held to be valid ([1976] 1 S.C.R. 616) even although its exception requires the cooperation of institutions which, and professional persons who, operate wholly within provincial jurisdiction. (Head 7 for example, of section 92). [The case referred to is  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  not mention, and are not mentioned in, the Criminal Code, Parliament has established its own institution and engaged its own professionals for the purpose of the administration of this particular criminal law statute. It is nothing adverse to Parliament's jurisdiction here in enacting criminal law that it erects with it a national regulatory scheme overseen by a regulatory agency such as were mentioned not only in Canadian National Transportation case, but also more recently, on March 16, 1987, by Mr. Justice MacGuigan for the Appeal Division of this Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Drug Directorates and Bureau in the Health Protection Branch of the Department of National Health and Welfare mentioned in paragraphs 7 to 13 of the parties' "amended joint admission of facts". Another regulatory agency involved in this national regulatory scheme is the federal Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, mentioned in paragraph 14 of the joint admission. The parties agree that this department has certain responsibilities under the Act in question. In particular, this department's inspectors exercise the delegated responsibilities of inspectors under the Food and Drugs Act.
[51]
Now, the plaintiffs submit that when the attempt to enact criminal law goes beyond mere prohibition with penal consequences and into regulation, it goes beyond Parliament's powers. Such a contention cannot withstand the force of reasoning in the Standard Sausage judgment and the Kripps Pharmacy judgment, both carefully considered by the Supreme Court of Canada. The defendants submit that criminal law does not need to be, and has not been, interpreted in such a narrow sense as urged by the plaintiffs. This Court agrees with the defendants' submission (transcript 3, p. 128) that where the "legitimate" purpose - that is, "the pith and substance" - of the legislation is the protection of the public health and safety, supplemented by the suppression of deception and fraud, and not an attempt to protect or to suppress a particular trade or business, it is open to Parliament to legislate on the footing of criminal law.
[52]
It is noteworthy, also, that Parliament does not attempt, in this regard, to regulate the prices or quantities of goods. The legislation, including the Regulations, is not aimed at one sector or market for either promotion or derogation of another or others. Further, the regulation of product standards is exacted only insofar as the health and safety of the public are concerned. In his opus Constitutional Law of Canada (2nd Ed., Toronto: Carswell, 1985), at page 417, Professor Peter W. Hogg recites four examples in the Criminal Code whereby the appending of a regulatory or administrative agency with a power of dispensation does not dilute, or impugn the quality or vires of the respective criminal law provisions therein enacted. Indeed, there is no good reason why Parliament should not supplement prohibitions and their penal consequences with national regulatory schemes to ensure compliance. The "flagship offence", murder, needs moral and human family upbringing of yesterday's children to aid today's compliance with the prohibition, but that is not an apt function of the State, even though such upbringing sometimes fails. When, however, it comes to the manufacturing, labelling and marketing throughout Canada of ingestible substances which, depending on the dosages could be poisonous, capable of altering moods or just plain lethal, it cannot be reasoned that regulation by the Health Protection Branch (HPB), in the protection of public health and safety including informed buying and ingestion, is too heavy a burden for valid criminal law to bear.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at pp. 20 and 21, regarding legislative jurisdiction.
[53]
The Court finds that the Food and Drugs Act in its specific provision, paragraph 25(1)(o), delegating the power to make Regulations, and the general tenor of the impugned Regulations C.01.014 to C.01.014.4, as well as C.08.001 to C.08.011 are supportable pursuant to Head 27 of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 as criminal law and as legislation necessarily incidental to that criminal law. The particular Regulations must be examined further to consider their very particular relationship to the purpose of the Act, but their general tenor is supportable for the regulatory scheme designed to generate compliance with this particular manifestation of valid criminal law.
I(3): Peace, Order and Good Government
[54]
The general grant of legislative jurisdiction, expressed in the opening words of section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, runs as follows:
"91. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make Laws for the Peace, Order and good Government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the Classes of Subject by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces;"
and, so as not to restrict the generality of the above, but for greater certainty, there follows the list of most of Parliament's classes of subjects for its legislative authority, including, of course, the criminal law, which is discussed earlier herein.
[55]
It may be wondered why the Court would bother to examine the subject at hand through the optic of p.o. & g.g., once it had concluded that the Act and Regulations rest on Parliament's head of legislative authority to enact laws coming within that class of subject specifically enumerated as "the criminal law ... including the procedure in criminal [law] matters". Ordinarily, when a legislative exercise can be so classified, further enquiry is discontinued. However, there is nothing contrary to good reason in enquiring whether the legislation may not be supported by some further legislative authority accorded to the enacting legislature. Usually, of course, such an enquiry is next-to, if not completely, irrelevant since the prime characterization of the legislation's matter settles the question of the division of legislative authority.
[56]
In the instant case, the Court characterizes the prohibitions-and-penalties aspect of the Food and Drugs Act as criminal law, and the impugned Regulations as criminal law, too, but because they are necessarily incidental to Parliament's schema of prohibitions and penalties in order to protect public health and safety and to deter or punish fraud and deception. It is conceivable, however, that the necessarily incidental Regulations could have a federal basis of their own, to which the prohibitions and penal consequences could assume the rôle of being necessarily incidental.
[57]
The proposed approach is, after all, not unthinkable.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the appellant mounted two attacks on the provincial legislation, both based on separate matters of Parliament's legislative authority: trade and commerce, and federally incorporated companies. Both attacks failed but, in the provincial court of appeal, each attracted some support. More to the point of double attributions of legislative authority however are the cases of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 1074; 42 N.R. 361; 37 A.R. 541, and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  accepted the legitimacy of such an approach. (Transcript 3, pp. 16 to 19.)
[58]
It may safely be assumed that neither amino acids in general (the "building blocks" of proteins per HPB Information Letter, ex. 1 (E-10) p. 1) nor essential amino acids, for example, tryptophan in particular (ex. 1 (E-10) p. 2), were uppermost in the minds of the Fathers of Confederation when they were considering the division of powers. Had they turned their minds to the task of defining the term "drug" they might very well have formulated a definition closely similar to that which is expressed in section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act. However such was not their concern. What they wrought was the notion of legislating, not about substances or things, but rather in relation to classes of subject, with logical examples for greater certainty, or, in some instances, simply pragmatic allocations to accord with their expectations or tolerations of a federal state. There were to be no "cracks" and no legislative lacunae in the powers of what was to be a virtually, and has become a completely, sovereign federal state.
[59]
The broad scope suggested by p.o. & g.g. in section 91 has become somewhat limited over the years, and also more precisely defined. In Re: Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373; 9 N.R. 541, Mr. Justice Beetz, despite being in dissent, articulated a view of p.o. & g.g. which was apparently accepted by the majority. He opined that Parliament's authority to enact laws for p.o. & g.g. is confined to two types of legislation: (i) temporary measures dealing with a national emergency; and (ii) legislation dealing with "distinct subject matters which do not fall within any of the enumerated heads of section 92 and which, by nature, are of national concern". (Page 457, S.C.R.) In the Labatt Breweries case, above cited, at pp. 944 and 945 S.C.R., Mr. Justice Estey perceived two groupings in that second branch: (a) areas where the federal competence arises because the subject matter did not exist at the time of Confederation and it cannot be classified as a matter of a merely local or private nature; and (b) areas where the subject matter "goes beyond local or provincial concern or interest and must, from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole". In effect, one can speak of three branches.
[60]
The first branch - temporary legislation dealing with a national emergency - does not apply here. The "new drug" Regulations and the drug Regulations taken together are certainly not intended to be merely temporary in duration, and there is no evidence of a "new drugs" emergency.
[61]
The defendants submit that either the second or third branches of p.o. & g.g., or both of them, are capable of sustaining the impugned legislation, including the pertinent Regulations.
[62]
To rest upon and within the second branch, the subject matter of the legislation would have to be regarded as not existing at the time of Confederation and as not being a matter of a merely local or private nature. However, subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Act and the new drug Regulations do not precisely meet the first criterion. It is, nevertheless, true that every new pharmaceutical product generated by the on-going process of scientific and chemical research, analysis and development, must have been "new" at some point. To be sure, most in being today were generated since July 1, 1867. Furthermore, no evidence was presented to indicate that nowadays there is a problem about the safety, efficacy and proper labelling of new drugs which did not exist at the time of Confederation, although one could probably surmise that such is the case.
[63]
The subject matter of the new drug Regulations is to protect the people from the dissemination for the ingestion by themselves or their animals or other use or consumption of potentially deleterious or otherwise dangerous drugs and from deception in the dissemination for such ingestion, use or consumption of substances falsely or mistakenly advertized to have the properties of drugs or of other drugs. Now, it is apparent that there is no permanently closed book of drug substances and chemicals which bars scientific analysis, new understandings, modifications or recombinations thereof. Research and development, as the Regulations themselves clearly show, are the essentials of the living pharmaceutical industry, or if not, Parliament at least is prepared for them in defence of the public interest by the avoidance of potential jeopardy thereto, through regulation.
[64]
Just as there is no closed book of criminal offences, so there is no closed book of what constitutes the peace, order and good government of Canada, because the Constitution distributes in this federal state all of the legislative power inherent in the notion of a sovereign state. It must be added that there is no closed book of "all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province". The legislature is always capable of dealing with the exigencies of human ingenuity which include criminality and the creation of jeopardy. Where, in the free market which is Canada, those evils can be disseminated into two or more provinces and the legislative jurisdiction is not specifically and exclusively assigned to provincial legislatures, there is a subject matter of national concern which resides within p.o. & g.g. It may arise because the subject matter did not appear to exist at the time of Confederation.
[65]
The criminal law did surely exist at that time. But the necessary, complementary regulation of what is just "outside" of the profile of the criminal law in regard to the dissemination of pharmaceutical products cannot necessarily be seen either in the Confederation debates, nor in the specific distribution of exclusive heads of legislative power.
[66]
At this point the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ought to be mentioned. There, the Supreme Court concluded that it was not the criminal law, but rather p.o. & g.g. upon which the constitutional validity of the Narcotic Control Act rests. Writing for the majority of the bench, Mr. Justice Pigeon held that the Narcotic Control Act was enacted to deal with a genuinely new problem - abuse of narcotics - which did not exist at the time of Confederation. The judgment was much criticized. It now appears to be generally accepted that the majority, for whom Pigeon, J., spoke, erred  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in holding that the very prohibition and penalty provisions of that Narcotic Control Act, whose prosecutions were directly under consideration, rested on p.o. & g.g.
[67]
There is nothing genuinely new about prohibitions with penal consequences, for, unless they be invoked for colourably inappropriate ends, they constitute valid criminal law. But there is more to the statutory control of narcotics than that. There is, notably, section 12 of that Act, thus:
"12. The Governor in Council may make Regulations
(a) providing for the issue of licences
(i) for the importation, export, sale, manufacture, production or distribution of narcotics, and
(ii) ...
(b) prescribing the form, duration and terms and conditions of any [such] licence ... the fees payable therefor, and ... the cancellation and suspension [thereof]
(c) authorizing the sale or possession of or other dealing in narcotics and prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which and the persons by whom narcotics may be sold, had in possession or otherwise dealt in;
(d) requiring physicians, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists and other persons who deal in narcotics as authorized by this Act or the Regulations to keep records and make returns.
(e) authorizing the communication of any information obtained under this Act or the Regulations to provincial professional licensing authorities;
(f) prescribing the punishment by a fine ... or imprisonment ... or both, to be imposed ... for breach of any regulation; and
(g) generally, for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this Act."
In truth, the Narcotic Control Act does appear to evince the criminal law power of Parliament, but the provisions of its section 12 with the necessarily incidental Regulations thereunder do appear, as Pigeon, J., said, to rest on p.o. & g.g. Someone might, of course, try to argue that they constitute a licensing scheme, or that they purport to regulate the medical, dental, veterinarian and pharmaceutical professions in each province, or some such similar argument, but clearly such arguments could not prevail. Of course, under the Narcotic Control Act the prohibitions and regulation are a good deal more simple and less subtle than they are under the Food and Drugs Act because, under the former statute
all
drugs and substances are regarded by Parliament as being
very powerful
and
highly dangerous
. Since that is not always the case, in both respects under the Food and Drugs Act, the regulation on the edge of the profile of criminality there is more complex because Parliament is relenting somewhat from the firm and severe standards invoked in the narcotic control legislation.
[68]
In both instances, it is clear, the regulation of those drugs which are not absolutely prohibited, which may be utilized under regulatory conditions for moderating or obviating danger to public health and obviating fraud and deception, is a matter not of the specifically profiled criminal law, but rather of peace, order and good government. To such extent, surely, the majority of the Supreme Court for whom Pigeon, J., wrote the opinion  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  must be accepted as stating authoritative constitutional law in regard to p.o. & g.g. Indeed, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Martland writing for the Supreme Court of Canada said at page 197, that "there is no sound reason for now reversing" the Court's judgment  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . That Aziz judgment, according to Chief Justice Laskin, "was cautious in its endorsement of Hauser as basing the Narcotic Control Act entirely on the peace, order and good government clause". He made this statement in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 115 S.C.R. saying in his individual concurrence with the majority that Hauser was incorrectly decided and that he "would have supported the reasons of Spence, J., who,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , saw the Narcotic Control Act as referable to both the criminal law power and to the trade and commerce power; see [1979] 1 S.C.R. 984, at pp. 1003-1004."
[69]
In his Constitutional Law of Canada (above cited), Prof. Hogg flatly concludes "that Hauser was wrongly decided, and should be overruled by the Court" going on to say that the Narcotic Control Act "is properly to be characterized as a criminal law. It cannot be placed within the national concern branch of p.o.g.g.". It would be hard to disagree with Prof. Hogg in regard only to the prohibitions and penalties provided in that Act. However his view seems to be not so sensitive as to notice the other aspect of that Act in section 12 and the Regulations, which, quite apart from the principal prohibitions with penal consequences, can surely be enacted by Parliament pursuant to p.o. & g.g. Given the harmful nature of the narcotic drugs regulated under the Regulations, Parliament might lawfully choose the paths of criminal law prohibition, or residual power regulation, or both aspects in the same statute, as it did in fact choose.
[70]
So it is with the regulatory aspects in the Food and Drugs Act's Regulations for identifying and labelling of drugs and new drugs. Parliament has chosen both aspects in the legislation and Regulations. These are not matters of a merely local and private nature, but rather of concern to the whole nation.
[71]
When does the subject matter of such Regulations become of such concern? Prof. Hogg, in his cited work at page 379, asserts that the answer can be gleaned, if at all, from the dicta in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . It is "a sense that it is the nationwide importance of a subject of legislation" which "determines whether or not it has the requisite national concern". Yet, the author quickly notes, that criterion is too subjective to serve as a justiciable test. Adding geographical extent and the notion of uniformity helps, but still does not perfect the justiciability of the test.
[72]
An appropriate test of national interest, endorsed by Prof. Hogg, is that enunciated by Professor R. Dale Gibson in (1967), 7 Man. L.J., twice cited at p. 379 of Hogg's work. It is the "provincial inability" test whereby, if a problem of wide import in Canada cannot realistically be solved by provincial co-operation, because it is beyond the power of the provinces to deal with it, the subject matter resides within the "national interest" scope of p.o. & g.g. It may be noted that Dickson, J., in dissent applied just such a test to determine the content of the trade and commerce power which he considered in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the dissemination for ingestion of potentially harmful drugs and new drugs in and throughout Canada goes realistically beyond the control of individual provinces, even in the realm of uniform law. Uniform law does not bespeak uniform regulatory agencies. That is, provincial attempts to protect the public from potentially unsafe and deceptively labelled drugs and new drugs would be frustrated if even one province declined to enact like legislation or to create well motivated regulatory agencies. Section 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 exacts that "all articles of the ... manufacture of any one of the provinces shall ... be admitted free into each of the other provinces". Thus, people of all provinces could buy such drugs in, or from, the unhelpful province or provinces.
[74]
The regulation which the plaintiffs so dislike, C.01.014.2, illustrates the point. If the applicant complies, a DIN is issued which serves to identify the product and its ingredients throughout Canada. If the Director, on reasonable grounds, believes from the application and his or her own knowledge that the product is either not a drug, or is an injurious or dangerous drug, he or she may properly refuse to issue the document which sets out a new DIN. Reasonable grounds require the expression and communication of the reasons. In such circumstances, the regulation invites the applicant to submit additional information so that the Director can reconsider the first decision. In such a manner the health of persons everywhere in Canada can be protected or, it must be admitted, not protected in the event of negligence on the Director's part. Further, in such a manner, applications for DIN's submitted from anywhere in Canada may be verified and approved or rejected according to standard criteria. This is not criminal law. However, the criminal law prohibitions need to be supplemented by the more sensitive and refined instrumentality of the Regulations which, after all, help manufacturers from running afoul of the criminal law when they produce for sale and human ingestion a new product which, although not absolutely prohibited, remains potentially dangerous. It is the danger or potential danger through ingestion of deleterious substances or being misled as to quantities and compositions which render this subject matter one of national concern. Uniform provincial legislation including Regulations could not serve the purpose even if perfectly uniform unless the provincial legislatures also agreed unanimously upon one regulatory administration paid for by all. Such complete and instantaneous uniformity is achieved by legislation on the part of Parliament. The two "federal-purpose" aspects of the federal legislation here are necessarily incidental to each other on a reciprocal basis.
[75]
For all of the pertinent foregoing reasons, the Court holds that subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Food and Drugs Act, with the DIN and new-drug Regulations made thereunder, are intra vires of Parliament, pursuant to its authority to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. They are matters of national interest and concern.
II. SUBORDINATE LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE: Are the DIN Regulations and/or the New-Drug Regulations ultra vires of the Governor General in Council for any of the following asserted reasons?
[76]
In regard to this issue, with its asserted reasons, which follow, one must now, in light of the earlier conclusions herein, accept that the Food and Drugs Act, with the kind or scope of Regulations recited and reviewed above, is indeed intra vires of Parliament. Here the question is, given the following, did Parliament accord to its delegate the authority to make the very Regulations, or did the Governor in Council exceed the mandate accorded? If the Governor in Council did exceed the mandate either in regard to the powers conferred by the Act, or in regard to Parliament's own powers, then, to such extent, the impugned Regulations must be held to be ultra vires of the Governor in Council.
[77]
Counsel for the plaintiffs is quite probably correct in saying (transcript 2, pp. 2 to 4) that the issues articulated in II A., II C. and IV are subsumed as variations II B. that is, whether the impugned Regulations are vague and contain no objective standards. All specified issues were, nevertheless resolutely argued by both sides. Each person for which the Regulations are impugned by the plaintiffs will be considered in turn.
II A.: Do those Regulations constitute a licensing scheme not authorized by section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act?
[78]
The plaintiff Jamieson attacks the DIN Regulations and the new-drug Regulations, while the plaintiffs Pharmetics and Swiss Herbal attack only the new-drug Regulations. The DIN Regulations were promulgated purportedly pursuant to subparagraphs 25(1)(b)(i), (iii) and (iv) of the Food and Drugs Act; and the new-drug Regulations were made purportedly pursuant to subparagraphs 25(1)(o)(i) and (ii). Regulations pursuant to subparagraph (i) are not in contention as noted in transcript 2, pages 11 to 13. These statutory provisions are recited above, as are the impugned Regulations. They are too voluminous to repeat here. It is, however, worthwhile to repeat that the power conferred on the Governor in Council to make Regulations in section 25 is "for carrying the purposes and provisions of this Act into effect". As well, paragraph 25(1)(b) further delegates specific authority to make the kind of Regulations therein designated regarding any food, drug, cosmetic or device in order to prevent deception and injury to health.
[79]
Counsel for the plaintiffs avers that if the DIN Regulations went no further than the provisions of Regulations C.01.014 and C.01.014.1, and in particular the items in C.01.014.1(2), "I don't think we would be here today". (Transcript 2, page 15.) Nor do the plaintiffs quarrel with reg. C.01. 014.2(1).
[80]
In regard to reg. C.01.014.2(2) however, which authorizes the director of the HPB "on reasonable grounds ... to refuse to issue the document [the DIN] referred in subsection" C.01.014. 2(1), the plaintiffs express determined objection. This impugned subsection C.01.014.2(2) professes to operate where the Director believes on the stated grounds that product for which a DIN is sought
"(a) is not a drug, or
"(b) is a drug but that its sale would cause injury to the health of the consumer or purchaser, or would be a violation of the Act or these Regulations."
Paragraph (b) is poorly expressed. The mere sale of the product could constitute a violation of the law, but surely only the ingestion (or proximity, if the product were noxiously volatile or radioactive) could injure the health of the consumer (or purchaser). However, the Court would not invalidate that paragraph on that account, for the intent and meaning are hardly unclear. Rather, the plaintiffs complain that paragraph C.01.014.2(2) (b) is vague and imprecise because, they say, it prescribes no standard for determining what constitutes injury to the health of the consumer. (Transcript 2, page 18.) They argue that even a product which is regarded to be as innocuous as aspirin could be impugned under that paragraph. (Exhibit 3, cross-examination of Simon Young, p. 31.) It may well be that aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA) ought to be more closely regulated, but that is another question not here in issue.
[81]
In regard to the new-drug Regulations, paragraphs C.08.001(a), (b) and (c) all include in their definitions the qualification that the drug or combination
"has not been sold ... in Canada for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada the safety and effectiveness of that drug [or combination and proportion, or condition of use] as a drug."
Of this common qualifier the plaintiff's counsel argues that "there is nothing in this regulation ... to guide the ordinary citizen in determining what quantities are sufficient, and what length of time is sufficient for the purposes of this drug". (Transcript 2, page 23.)
[82]
Reg. C.08.002(1)(a) is also objectionable to the plaintiffs in that it requires the filing of a new-drug submission "in a form and having a content satisfactory to the Minister". Further reg. C.08.022(2) exacts that such a submission must "include such information and material as the Director may require, and without limiting the generality of the forgoing, shall include" the information and material specified in paragraphs (a) to (n). Not without significance to the outcome of this adjudication are two paragraphs to which counsel for the plaintiffs made special reference. They are:
"(g) detailed reports of the tests made to establish the safety of the new drug for the purpose and under the conditions recommended [by the manfacturer];
"(h) substantial evidence of the clinical effectiveness of the new drug for the purpose and under the conditions of use recommended [again, by the manufacturer];"
Noteworthy in this regard is the exception in reg. C.08.005(1) whereby a manufacturer may sell a new drug to "'qualified investigators' for the sole purpose of clinical testing to obtain evidence with respect to the safety, dosage and effectiveness of the new drug" subject to enumerated reasonable conditions. However, reg. C.08.005(3) empowers the Minister to prohibit such sales if, in his or her opinion, "it is in the interest of public health to do so". The plaintiffs concede that if the Act be intra vires of Parliament, as it has herein been found to be, "it would have been perfectly legitimate and competent for Parliament to legislate in these terms, but that is not what Parliament chose to do". (Transcript 2, pages 28 & 29.)
[83]
The plaintiffs complain that this kind of regulation amounts to saying that the Minister and Director must be satisfied as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug or substance. They submit "that for the Regulations to be valid ... they must have the degree of specifically necessary for an ordinary citizen to know in advance, on a simple reading of the regulation, what is expected of him, what test he must meet in order to obtain a DIN or, in the case of a new drug, a notice of compliance".
[84]
Now, do these Regulations constitute a licensing scheme not authorized by section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act? They do not.
[85]
The plaintiffs' counsel cited a considerable volume of learned doctrine and jurisprudence, in support of their contentions. It is important to note that such doctrine and jurisprudence virtually entirely relates to municipal bylaws and Regulations. These will be considered under the next enumerated issue herein, I.B. relating to the questions of objective standards or vagueness.
[86]
What constitutes these Regulations into an unauthorized licensing scheme say the plaintiffs (transcript 2, pages 118 to 121 and following) is the authority of Minister and/or the Director to withhold a DIN or a notice of new-drug compliance upon their opinion that the submissions do not comply with the Act or the Regulations and the authority to require further information or material.
[87]
The plaintiffs rely principally on the decision of the Ontario High Court in Re Imperial Oil Limited and The City of Kingston, [1955] O.W.N. 767, in which, they say "the matter is very succinctly put". (Transcript 2, page 119). The text of that decision is very brief. (Plaintiffs' books of authorities, Part III, tab 1.) It bears an index reference to "Municipal Corporations - Regulatory Powers" the particular passage emphasized runs:
"The cases that were referred to in argument by counsel for the applicant establish that while The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 234, gives authority to municipalities to regulate and prohibit the matters set out in s. 388, clause 16, that does not carry with it the authority to annex to a regulation a proviso requiring a further permission. The cases referred to were  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The reason for that rule is, I think, obvious, and it is salutary because if any municipality could establish Regulations and then say an applicant required a further approval, it would permit discrimination."
This passage does not disclose the entire ratio of the decision. The subsequent paragraphs indicate that the city relied on the wrong clause for its purported denial of permission to store a substance, gasoline, which was governed by another clause. Although the text does refer to "the issuance of any permit", it makes no reference to any licensing scheme.
[88]
What the Imperial Oil and Kingston decision stands for, in the context of municipal law, is that when the municipal bylaw provides for the approval of a designated official (or even officials) the corporation cannot gratuitously require the further approval of another official, or even the city council. That case hardly goes against the impugned Food and Drug Regulations. For certain specific purposes expressed in those Regulations approval is required on the part of the Minister or the Director, who are the officials designated in the regulations. Apart from public service employees who are assigned to help them, under their direction and responsibility it may be noted, there is no other official or no other body or council from whom one must seek a DIN or notice of compliance. If these Food and Drug Regulations were required to conform with the cited decision, they would not fail in this regard.
[89]
Furthermore, these regulations purport to regulate the dissemination of drugs, substances, products and the claims made for their properties and uses. The Regulations do not purport to licence the manufacturers and merchants of drugs in their business existence or organizations, nor in their sales forces or price structures. They have nothing whatever to do with permission to carry on any such business. They simply do not constitute a licensing scheme. In this regard they simply do evince the regulation-making power of the Governor in Council pursuant to Parliament's enabling legislation, the Food and Drugs Act.
II B. The Regulations, do they establish no objective standards, and are they too vague?
[90]
The plaintiffs regard this question to be the principal matter of attack on the Regulations. They assert that both the DIN and new-drug Regulations are ultra vires on the ground of vagueness. Here they begin with the learned work of the late Hon. L.-P. Pigeon, Rédaction et Interprétation des Lois. Under the title "Delegatus non potest delegare" that renowned author wrote a lucid chapter, which could perhaps be encapsulated by these passages at pages 25 and 26:
"On peut bien charger un fonctionnaire de vérifier l'observance des normes, mais on ne peut pas lui déléguer le pouvoir de les faire.
. . . . .
"La décision capitale sur ce point est ...:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Il s'agissait du règlement pour les permis de restaurants. ... Le permis avait été refusé parce que le chef de police avait refusé de donner la recommandation. Qu'est-ce que la Cour suprême a dit? Eh bien elle a fait tout simplement observer que le règlement n'établissait pas de normes. On a dit ceci: 'no standard, rule or condition is prescribed'. ... C'est lui [le chef de police] qui va faire le règlement, puisqu'on dit 'le permis ne sera pas accordé si vous n'accordez pas votre recommandation et votre recommandation vous l'accorderez ou la refuserez selon votre bon plaisir'. ... Les municipalités ont le pouvoir de réglementer toutes sortes de choses en cette matière, mais il faut que les normes soient énoncées dans le document décrété par le conseil municipal ou dans une annexe qui en fait partie. ... Ce qui n'est pas permis, c'est de ne pas établir les normes et par conséquent de charger un fonctionnaire de les établir à la place du conseil en lui déléguant le pouvoir d'accorder le permis ou de le refuser à sa discrétion. Pour qu'il n'y ait pas de délégation de pouvoir, il faut que le fonctionnaire soit chargé de vérifier l'observance de normes prescrites et non pas l'observance de directives inexistantes ou encore de directives imprécises. Evidemment personne ne peut dire à priori à quel point la directive est tellement imprécise qu'elle équivaut à une délégation de pouvoir; le critère, c'est savoir si une personne raisonnable peut, en fonction du texte, décider si oui ou non on s'est conformé au règlement."
The above recited passages are found in the plaintiffs' book of authorities, Part II, tab 1.
[91]
It will be noted that the learned author, above quoted, refers to Regulations, or bylaws enacted by a municipal council, and does so throughout the longer text from which the above recited passages are drawn. The law on this issue is not entirely clear, or is largely misunderstood. The plaintiffs cited a number of judicial decisions in support of their contention that Regulations must be precise in defining requisite conditions for compliance and, if not, then the Regulations may be struck down as ultra vires for vagueness. An incomplete list of such cases, for example, is: Comité d'administration du régime de rentes c. La Régie des rentes, unreported, 500-05-024078-782, 6 novembre 1979 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (appeal dismissed, unreported, 500-09-00910-752 C.A.M., 27 Feb. 1981); La Corporation  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Re Campeau Corporation and City of Ottawa (1978), 22 O.R.(2d) 40 (Div. Ct.); and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (N.S.S. C.T.D.). It must be noted that all of these cases involved municipal bylaws. There is no denying that bylaws may be invalidated for vagueness and uncertainty; indeed, such has been the law since  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). Whether the same can be said of Regulations emanating from the Governor in Council is another question.
[92]
At tab 2 of Part II of their books of authorities the plaintiffs reproduce pages 319 and 320 from Patrice Garant Droit administratif, Montréal, Editions Yvon Blais Inc. At page 319 that learned author writes:
"Certes, il faut prendre garde au fait que cette cause de nullité a traditionnellement été considérée comme étant 'propre aux règlements adoptés par des autorités non centrales telles des corporations municipales et professionnelles'. (146) Toutefois, il est arrivé que certains arrêts, dans la jurisprudence relative au contrôle de la rationalité, aient bien laissé entendre qu'on pourrait contrôler tout règlement pour cause d'imprécision, même celui émanant de l'autorité gouvernementale. (147) Puis le principe a été graduellement appliqué par la Cour supérieure. (148)
. . . . .
146. Côte et Lord, op. cit., note 145, p. 30; de Smith, Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 3e éd., London, Stevens and Sons, 1973, p. 312.
147.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ."
The citations mentioned in footnote 148 are, again, municipal cases.
[93]
In footnote 146, Prof. Garant cites De Smith's third edition. That to which attention is drawn there, is mentioned again in the fourth edition: S.A. De Smith, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4th Ed.), by J.M. Evans (London: Stevens, 1980), at pages 354 and 355:
"It has commonly been assumed that no criterion of reasonableness governs the validity of statutory instruments made by Ministers or Her Majesty in Council. If a statutory instrument or other departmental regulation appears to a court to be outrageous it may be held to be ultra vires, but its invalidity will probably not be attributed to unreasonableness per se. But there is no reason of principle why a manifestly unreasonable statutory instrument should not be held to be ultra vires on that ground alone, provided that the subject-matter of the grant of power is not so pregnant with 'policy' considerations as to render the application of such a standard inappropriate."
It certainly must be conceded that even a statutory instrument made by the Governor in Council is liable to be invalidated if it bear no perceivable relationship to the subject matter of the statute, or the expressed purpose of the rule-making authority enacted therein; or if it run contrary to the Constitution; or if it counsel or require the commission of an offence; or if it be simply incomprehensible or uncertain in its application.
[94]
A regulation made by the executive branch pursuant to a validly enacted statute, either federal or provincial, however, enjoys a greater security against judicial invalidation than does the bylaw of a municipal corporation. This same consideration arose in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  law, it is appropriate to note that common law courts traditionally have drawn the distinction between statutory Regulations and municipal bylaws. Professor Driedger noted such distinction: Bylaws are enacted by subordinate legislatures or other bodies such as universities or professional corporations which are all creatures of the legislature, but which are not directly responsible to the legislature or the executive branch, whereas Regulations, by contrast, are enacted by the executive which is answerable to the legislature. (Subordinate Legislation (1960), 38 Can. Bar. Rev. 1, at p. 2.)
[95]
Bennion Statutory Interpretation (London, 1984) at page 144, calls the distinction "illogical" but explains and teaches it. R. Dussault and L. Borgeat Administrative Law: A Treatise, trans. M. Rankin (Toronto: Carswell, 1985), write at page 422 on the subject of imprecision. They speak of the principle of requiring "some degree of precision and detail" and go on to say that: "Today this principle is applied quite rigorously by courts, especially, but not exclusively in municipal matters". The examples given under this heading are all cases involving either municipalities or professional corporations. In any event such institutions are of a local, provincial character and their bylaws are perhaps not aptly compared and contrasted with statutory regulation in Parliament's domain.
[96]
Conspicuously absent here are cases where Regulations and other forms of subordinate legislation emanating from the executive were held not to be subject to challenge on the ground of uncertainty or unreasonableness. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).
[97]
If, however, as Bennion states, the distinction although real in law, is illogical it is not utterly egregious and wanton. Municipal "legislatures" are after all congressional in nature in that the executive remains secure in its fixed term of office even if it loses the confidence of the elected tribunes of the people. The federal and provincial legislatures are parliamentary in that the executive branches are responsible to, and must maintain the confidence of, the elected legislators, or they must resign from office. Bennion, op. cit., at page 204, indicates:
"[With regard to voidness for uncertainty] the interpreter is not permitted to declare an enactment containing a broad term or other ambiguous expression void for uncertainty. The uncertainty is intended to be resolved by the interpreter. ... A corresponding rule applies to uncertainty in statutory instruments and most other delegated legislation. ... The position is different with bylaws however. A bylaw may be declared void if uncertain in its terms."
The above passage is no doubt a correct statement of the law, excepting, of course, the kind of gross defects mentioned a few paragraphs above herein.
[98]
In regard to reg. C.01.014.2(2), which authorizes the Director "on reasonable grounds ... to refuse to issue the" DIN where the product for which it is sought "would cause injury to the health of the consumer" or its sale "would be a violation of the Act or ... Regulations", these provisions are reasonable and in sweet accord with the purpose and intent of the legislation. They are clear enough for the plaintiffs and other manufacturers and merchants in the industry.
[99]
The plaintiffs' counsel seek to paint their clients with a pristine gloss of wide-eyed naïvety. This observation applies to their submissions in regard to all the impugned Regulations. The plaintiffs and their ilk are not just plain, ordinary lay folk, a standard to which plaintiffs' counsel pitched their arguments in attacking the precision and clarity of the Regulations. The Regulations are themselves not pitched to the ordinary, average - or even above average - person whom one might randomly meet in the street or on any other everyday occasion. The Act and the Regulations are aimed at the regulation of drugs and other substances which are disseminated by manufacturers and sellers of the same. There is no licensing scheme to prevent or filter out the ordinary person from becoming such a manufacturer or seller, or entering into the business, to be sure, but those who do so are quite rightly expected to know their business.
[100]
In the like manner, the bylaws of a professional corporation which denounce professional misconduct or which regulate the keeping of accounts (albeit part of true licensing schemes) are not pitched to a random person whom one might encounter in a shopping mall, but are, rather, pitched to the appropriate professionals. Such professionals cannot credibly assume the mantle of an ordinary lay person and claim that professional misconduct, for example, is a concept which is too general or too vague or too unclear for compliance by that ordinary lay person. Of course, the notion of any ward politics, local jealousies or municipal zeal is plainly out of the question in terms of the exercise of regulation-making authority in this case of federal statutory regulation.
[101]
The Court will simply not strike down such a statutory regulation on the ground of alleged vagueness. The "applicant" here, intending to market a drug or a new drug, must be deemed to know something of the properties of the product. If the applicant does not know enough about it, and if the Director harbours a reasonable apprehension of its causing injury to health, or if the Director perceives that marketing it would violate the Act or Regulations, he does not confound the applicant by refusing a DIN. Indeed, in such circumstances the applicant is not necessarily foreclosed from obtaining a drug identification number, for subregulations C.01.014.2(3) and (4) invite dialogue between the Director and the applicant. In truth, the clear meaning of the regulation is a message to the applicant to provide to the Director all the information which the applicant can possibly obtain about the properties of the drug and the product. The basic informational requirements are set out in C.01.014.1(2), to which the plaintiffs take no objection. The provisions of C.01.014.2(2) to the effect that the Director may refuse only where his belief is formed on reasonable grounds, require the Director to make such grounds known to the applicant. The message is clear, and the invitation to clear up the Director's apprehensions is equally clear. In the result, the regulation is not unclear, not too imprecise for the "applicant" in the context of this Act, these Regulations and this industry.
[102]
The new drug Regulations are also alleged to be without objective standards and therefore too vague to be allowed to stand. The definitions of new drugs, expressed reg. C.08.001(a), (b) and (c) all have that common qualifier about not having been sold in Canada for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada their safety and effectiveness. From the evidence in this case, if not from well and commonly known facts, there is a positive inference to be drawn that manufacturers, through their research and development programs, are virtually constantly propounding new drugs for dissemination in the market. The constitutionally legitimate purpose of this legislation is to regulate such products and their dissemination for the protection of the health and medicine-oriented expectations of the public. It is only common sense that new drugs be accepted with a cautious prudence. No doubt that is why the definitions of "food" and "drug" say what they include, and not definitively what they, for all time, are. What must be established is the safety and efficacy of such drugs and their combinations. That is something of which the seller, and especially the manufacturer, must know something. That is something of which the seller and manufacturer must learn something, if they do know, and relate it to the Director.
[103]
These Regulations, in sweet accord with the purposes and intent of the legislation, are meant to discourage a slap-dash selling and advertising campaign without ascertaining the properties and effects of the new drugs which are to be sold and advertized. The touchstone here is safety and effectiveness. It is for the person, firm or corporation formulating a new drug submission to decide soberly when to make it in regard to the time and quantities of sale in Canada.
[104]
The safety and efficacy of a new drug or indeed any drug may be ascertained by clinical testing as mentioned in paragraphs C.08.002(2)(g) and (h). Now clinical testing is prima facie a matter of a local and private nature in any province, subject to provincial regulation and licensing of the health and other scientific professions. The Regulations do not purport to trench upon such matters (although there is some justification to do so in regard to p.o. & g.g.) but, rather, they ask for the results of such testing. In administering the Regulations, the HPB does not interfere with private consumption of drugs which are not otherwise forbidden or restricted. Unless one be a latter-day Lucretia Borgia (a matter for the criminal law) one may otherwise have the substance in question here for personal use. Thus paragraph 1 of the Additional Admissions of the parties, included in the trial record, provides:
"1. The Health Protection Branch does not object to importations of reasonable quantities of isolated amino acids by individuals for their own personal use."
[105]
Because the definitions of "food" and "drug" expressed in section 2 of the Act are not set in eternally finite terms, and are not even mutually exclusive, it can be noted that Parliament must have been quite aware of the well known facts that food and drug research is actively performed in Canada and elsewhere. It is also well known that foods can contain substances which, when extracted, evince the properties of drugs; and some foods and drugs are discovered, through refined clinical and pharmaceutical techniques, to have hitherto unsuspected effects on life and health. These facts are manifested also through the evidence herein and the inferences to be drawn from the entirety of it. Drug research and development are a field of new discovery and changed expectations.
[106]
It is obvious that, if the Regulations are to be consonant with the purposes of this intra vires legislation, and if the Minister, the Director, the HPB with the other branches and bureaux, and the inspectors are all to discharge the duties imposed by the legislation, this regulatory system must be responsive to the new discoveries in terms of safety and be capable of exacting that the public be adverted to all changed expectations of basic use and effectiveness.
[107]
Examined for discovery by plaintiffs' counsel (exhibit 4), Robert Ferrier, head of the defendants' Bureau of Non-prescription Drugs made the following unexceptionable answers to questions posed to him (May 10, 1985, pp. 73, 76, 77, 81 and 82):
"245. Q. When you came to the conclusion that you had to consider isolated amino acid products as new drugs, on whose recommendation did you come to that conclusion.
A. Well that conclusion was based on recommendations from our Dr. Armstrong and his staff primarily.
[Paras. 10 (T-2583-84) & 13 (T-2968-84) - Amended Joint Admission of Facts] -
Dr. Armstrong was, at all relevant times to the litigation, the Assistant Director and Chief of the Drug Evaluation Division of the Bureau of Non-Prescription Drugs of the Drug Directorate and reports to Mr. Ferrier.
246. Okay, were there any incidents reported to your bureau that single amino acid products, whether those of Jamieson or of any other manufacturer, particularly those you referred to as having been allowed to release them under the emergency drug regulation--were any incidents reported that these products themselves had caused damage or harm to humans consuming them?
A. I'm not aware of any--of any reports of that nature.
. . . . .
L-tryptophan [an isolated amino acid according to the pleadings and, paras. 2 and 6 of Amended Joint Admission of Facts] is widely recognized as having some type of sedative affect [sic]. It is these effects that have been recognized in reference texts such as Martindales, in several Canadian reference texts for that matter. It is reputed to have this sedative affect [sic], and has been used in psychiatric institutions for the treatment of certain psychotic diseases. The product was in a pharmaceutical dosage form. It had directions for use, and because it was considered--because of this information, we consider this to be a drug, and on the basis of the fact that we did not have sufficient evidence in the Health Protection Branch regarding the safety and effectiveness, it was a new drug.
. . . . .
266. Q. Do you or your bureau consider that until you have all the information you require about a substance, article or product that is being marketed, you must or will declare it to be a new drug or place it in new drug status?
A. Not necessarily so. If we have an application for a new drug--for a drug identification number, we--our first step is to if unless the information is readily available to us, if it's something that is unknown to us, we will routinely request the manufacturer to give us some further information on that particular ingredient.
267 Q. But if, as in the case here of most if not all except one products, the Plaintiffs did not apply for drug identification numbers, would your bureau or you consider that the products they placed on the market were new drugs until you got the information you wanted, just because they placed them on the market?
A. Based on past action of other manufacturers, other applicants, we would probably consider these products to be drugs just from a knowledge of the activities, the actions of these particular products."
[108]
From this testimony it can be seen that an applicant, manufacturer or seller of products in the synthetic or supplemented food, and especially the drug field, can appreciate exactly what the regulations require by invoking the experienced, quasi-professional judgment, of itself, of such an applicant, manufacturer or seller: reveal all information known about the product, including clinical tests and reports of hitherto unsuspected side-effects. In effect, such an applicant, unsuspected side-effects. In effect, such an applicant, manufacturer or seller must not disseminate any such product among the general public without being prepared to reveal or ultimately revealing all the facts, effects, properties, clinical trials and reports known to him, her or the firm about the product proposed to be disseminated to and through the public. Given the knowledge which the applicant has, or reasonably ought to have, such an applicant (as distinct from John and Jane Doe) is not confronted by imprecise, vague Regulations, at all. Full disclosure is the so-called "bottom line" or ultimate requirement imposed on knowledgeable applicants.
[109]
In light of the foregoing, and in light of the continuing stream of new discoveries and altered medicinal expectations produced by on-going research and development one is not surprised to note that the Regulations are administered in accordance with passages number 2 in the parties' Additional Admissions:
"2. That the Health Protection Branch considers that manufacturers have access to adequate warning of changes in policy concerning the acceptability of substances they manufacture through various mechanisms such as Branch Information Letters which are frequently used to announce proposed regulation changes or departmental positions on specific subjects.
"Another such mechanism for HPB/Manufacturer dialogue is through the DIN application procedure. This is a first step to check compliance. The importer should determine the acceptability and degree of compliance before he imports the drug product. Queries on such products should be directed to the Drug Inspection unit of HPB as a first step."
The Regulations, given the realities of the industry, are more than adequately precise and unambiguous. After all, the criterion is not an unattainable, absolute perfection. Certainly, to identify in a statute or Regulations all the new discoveries, all the possible reasonable apprehensions and questions which can legitimately occur to the Director, would require legislative clairvoyance and embarking into statutory expression which would necessarily be encyclopaedic in sheer volume. And one would still fail. The DIN and new drug Regulations, however, do not fail. They are clear and precise enough to tell the applicant to make full disclosure, whereupon the Director, within a limited time, will decide if the application complies with the legislated criteria.
II C. The impugned Regulations, do they constitute, or are they, an expression of an illegal subdelegation of authority?
[110]
"Minister", according to section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act, means the Minister of National Health and Welfare, a member of the cabinet and government of the day. It is stated in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Amended Joint Admission of Facts, that the Director under the Regulations is the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Department of National Health and Welfare, a federal government department which includes the HPB, which is, itself composed of various directorates. The Minister and the Director are, then, entirely appropriate delegates of the limited regulatory powers conferred by the Regulations. In view of the requirements imposed upon naturally knowledgeable, indeed, quasi-professional applicants, manufacturers and sellers in contemplation of the Regulations, taken together with the inherent mechanism for dialogue emplaced therein, it cannot be accepted that there is any illegal subdelegation of those powers.
[111]
But, the plaintiffs argue that the subdelegation of powers to the Minister and the Director, which Parliament conferred on the Governor in Council, is illegal. They contend that the Regulations, by conferring discretionary powers on the two officials are illegal subdelegations by the Governor in Council. Only the statute, and not the Regulations, may confer any such discretionary powers, the plaintiffs say. This results, according to the plaintiffs, in the Minister and civil servants developing their own standards and policies and, in effect it is the latter, and not the Governor in Council, who are making the Regulations.
[112]
Here the plaintiffs raise the maxim of delegatus non potest delegare. Since this principle is a presumption of statutory interpretation, and not a rule of law, it operates subject to any contrary intention found in the statute or in any other relevant statutes.
[113]
In the context of the administrative functions of modern government, the courts have not been markedly reluctant to perceive such an intention. In fact, they have developed a special rationale for finding an intention and a power to subdelegate in most legislative schemes empowering executive action. The seminal decision was made in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  regulation, but the court did not hold that its view of subdelegation related especially to that factor. The judgment was written by Lord Greene, M.R., and it has these passages, at pages 563 and 564:
"In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them. ... The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible.
. . . . .
"In the present case the assistant secretary, a high official of the Ministry, was the person entrusted with ... looking after this particular matter and the question, therefore, is ... did he direct his mind to the matters to which he was bound to direct it in order to act properly under this regulation?
. . . . .
"Parliament, which authorizes this regulation, commits to the executive the discretion to decide and with that discretion if bona fide exercised no court can interfere."
[114]
The Supreme Court of Canada expressly adopted from Carltona that line of reasoning. Writing for the unanimous bench, Dickson, J. (now Chief Justice of Canada), in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 8 N.R. 47, is reported at pages 245 and 246 S.C.R., as follows:
"Thus, where the exercise of a discretionary power is entrusted to a Minister of the Crown it may be presumed that the acts will be performed, not by the Minister in person, but by responsible officials in his department:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  so many and so varied that it is unreasonable to expect them to be performed personally. It is to be supposed that the Minister will select deputies and departmental officials of experience and competence, and that such appointees, for whose conduct the Minister is accountable to the legislature, will act on behalf of the Minister, within the bounds of their respective grants of authority, in the discharge of ministerial responsibilities. Any other approach would but lead to administrative chaos and inefficiency."
So, where Parliament entrusts the Governor in Council to make Regulations for carrying out the purposes and provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, it may be presumed that some discretionary powers will be conferred in those Regulations, and it may further be presumed that the acts involved will be performed, not by the Governor in Council, but by the responsible Minister of the Crown, aided by designated deputies and departmental officials of experience and competence, and so, forth, to paraphrase Mr. Justice Dickson.
[115]
Of course, it is clear that the Governor in Council could not simply have conferred on the Minister or the Director the same power to make Regulations which Parliament conferred on the Governor in Council. That would indeed be an illegal subdelegation, as was explained by Laskin, J. (later C.J.C.), in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at page 147. Such a circumstance is far from those in the case at bar, and is quite distinguishable.
[116]
Also distinguishable is a decision of Mr. Justice Larue of the Superior Court of Québec in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  expressed at trial. There, the impugned regulation exacts that in order to obtain a bus transportation permit, an applicant must demonstrate to the Commission that it is in the public interest that such permit be issued to him for the service which he proposes to provide. That regulation appeared to leave the matter entirely to the Commission and did not direct it to receive any particular means of demonstrating the public interest, nor to make a decision, nor to invite dialogue by receiving supplementary submissions, as do the impugned Regulations in the case at bar. In leaving the discretionary powers of the Commission so much at large, the regulation in that Voyageur case closely resembles the void regulation in the Brant Dairy case, above mentioned. The Court expresses no criticism of the Voyageur decision, but notes that it does not effectively bear on the instant case.
[117]
According to the parties' Amended Joint Admission of Facts (T-2853-84), the factual operation of the Regulations, at the material times was, in part, the following:
"15. Authority to determine whether a product is a new drug was delegated to Dr. Cook by the Assistant Deputy Minister (who is the 'Director' under the Food and Drugs Act), and that authority was further delegated to Mr. Ferrier by Dr. Cook.
"14. Once a product has been determined to be a nonprescription drug, an opinion that such product is a new drug is formed by Mr. Ferrier on advice from his staff. Decisions as to whether products constitute new drugs are made by Mr. Ferrier. On occasion, as well, requests for determination as to whether a given product constitutes a new drug are made by departmental employees during the course of drug investigations. [Numbering as in original judgment]
"16. Only manufacturers that apply for a drug identification number (DIN) on a product, or manufacturers who request a decision on the status of a product, are normally advised that a product is a new drug.
"17. The present DIN system came into existence in July 1981 and the Bureau of Non-Prescription Drugs was formed in 1980.
"18. No application for a DIN was received by the Minister from the Plaintiffs with respect to any products listed in the Statement of Claim.
"19. Defendants have used in the past several criteria for determining whether a product is a new drug within the meaning of s. C.08.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations. Some of these criteria are found in the following documents, produced herewith as Exhibits in Schedule I hereto:
(a) 1 (E-4)
(b) 1 (E-9)
(c) 1 (E-10)
These criteria are not exhaustive. The Defendants exercise a certain discretion in their application.
"20. Under Defendants' present policy, DIN's are issued for products, not substances."
(Paras. 17 through 23 - (T-2968-84))
The explanations offered in the above cited exhibits reveal not a despotic, arbitrary octopus of an organization but, rather, one which, as later consideration of the evidence will reveal, did its pathetic best and still could not keep abreast of the numbers of new products being manufactured, labelled and marketed in Canada all the time. Such at least is one inference which can be drawn from Mr. Ferrier's evidence on discovery. Another strong inference is of confusion and inappropriate focus by the HPB, before the orienting interventions of Dr. Armstrong.
[118]
In any event whatever discretion is accorded by these clear and detailed Regulations is quite restricted. It is provided in C.01.014.2(1) that where the applicant has provided all the information described in C.01.014.1(2) or in C.08.002 or C.10.003, the Director shall issue a DIN. His sole grounds for declining, considered earlier herein, must be reasonable and specifically in accord with the Act and the other Regulations. Under reg. C.08.004 the Minister is bound either to issue a notice of compliance or to notify the manufacturer why the submission or supplement does not comply, within 120 days. The Minister is subject to the Court's supervising power to order mandamus in that regard. In both instances the applicant is entitled to respond, which is referred to herein as the "dialogue mechanism". These delegated powers do not permit the Minister or the Director to do as they please: they have no unfettered discretions.
[119]
The Court finds no illegal subdelegation here, as alleged by the plaintiffs.
Conclusions to Part II
[120]
In holding all of the impugned Regulations to be valid in regard to the attacks levied against them by the plaintiffs, the Court is far from certifying that the Regulations are absolutely perfect in every respect. They court be improved. Voluminous and detailed as they are, they could yet be more specific in some of the aspects of which the plaintiffs complain. However, upon analysis, and further, in view of Bannion's statement of the law (above), the jurisprudence cited, not least of which are the Brant Dairy dicta (above) and the decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Minister's and the Director's discretions, which are quite adequate to withstand the plaintiffs' complaints.
III. Were the isolated amino acids and amino acid products truly "new drugs" in contemplation of the Act and Regulations?
[121]
The authority to regulate the method of preparation, testing, sale and conditions of sale, and the authority to define the meaning of "new drug" by regulation are specifically conferred by paragraph 25(1)(o) of the Food and Drugs Act. The definitions are clearly set out in regulation C.08.001.
[122]
The plaintiffs submit that even if the new drug Regulations be not ultra vires, the isolated amino acids and amino acid products in question are not new drugs within the meaning of the Act and Regulations. In support, the plaintiffs adduced evidence to the effect that the identified substances are food, not drugs, or alternatively if they are drugs, they are not "new drugs". Some of this evidence was the following:
"- Mr. Margolis' and Mr. Maranda's testimony that all of these products are widely sold as food in the United States, and that the plaintiff-companies have never received a complaint of an adverse reaction to the ingestion of amino acids. (Transcript 1, pp. 63-75 and 95-99.)
"- Mr. Calsen's testimony that amino acid products are sold as food supplements in England. (Transcript 1, pp. 103-108.)
"- Mr. Abramson's testimony that his company - BEA Per Capita Consulting Corp. - sold isolated amino acids from 1974 till 1984, that the HPB had been aware of this and indeed that it had told him in 1982 that a DIN was not required for such products, including L-tryptophan (exhibit 20 and 3(SY-1), 3(SY-3) and 3(SY-5) among others) - also that isolated amino acids are sold freely off the shelf at health food stores in Los Angeles, California. (Transcript 1, pp. 112-117.)
"- Mr. Busgang's testimony that beginning in 1982 through 1983, the plaintiff Pharmetics manufactured incrementally L-tryptophan, L-lysine, L-arginine, L-ornithine and L-phenylalanine for its co-plaintiff Swiss Herbal and others in the health food industry - otherwise his testimony was helpful in identifying the isolated amino acids in products listed by the defendants (ex. 1(E-25) annexure) which products received DINs prior to 1980."
[123]
Exhibit 2, the affidavit of Simon N. Young, an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, was the only expert evidence tendered on this issue. Prof. Young was cross-examined on his affidavit, prior to trial. The transcript of that cross-examination is exhibit 3 in suit no T-2968-84. Prof. Young is a biochemist. According to his curriculum vitae, he holds the following academic degrees:
"1967 B.A. (Honours) in chemistry, from Oxford, England
"1968 M.Sc. in biochemistry, from London, England
"1971 Ph.D. in biochemistry, from London, England"
Prof. Young has been engaged in research dealing with amino acids for 14 years. His work is concerned primarily with tryptophan but he has also been engaged in studies on tryptophan, phenylalanine and histidine. The plaintiffs accepted Prof. Young's status and qualifications to tender expert evidence.
[124]
According to paragraph 6 of the Amended Joint Admission of Facts, all the plaintiffs at the time these proceedings started, were involved in the manufacture and/or sale of several isolated amino acids and amino acid products among which were those described as L-tryptophan and L-phenylalinine. Additionally, the plaintiffs Pharmetics and Swiss Herbal listed among their arrays DL-phenylalanine and Amino Acid Complex, 500 mg., Amino Acid Mixture, capsules, and Amino Acid Mixture, powder. The plaintiff Jamieson (para. 2 ... Joint ... Facts) began manufacturing and selling L-tyrosine in 1982 and L-methionine in 1984.
[125]
Here is what Prof. Young said about the above mentioned amino acids in his affidavit (ex. 2) sworn on December 9, 1986:
"2. Protein contains 20 different amino acids. All 20 of these amino acids are needed to form protein in the tissues of the human body. Half of the amino acids cannot be synthesized in the human body and are referred to as essential amino acids. Essential amino acids have to be supplied in the diet.
"3. Nearly all proteins in the diet contain all 20 amino acids. Amino acids occur in somewhat different proportions in different food sources, but any normal diet will supply sufficient quantities of all essential amino acids.
"4. In a situation where there is a deficient dietary intake of protein individual amino acids will not correct this deficiency. This is because all 20 amino acids are needed to form protein in the body. Although a mixture of all ten essential amino acids would help to correct a protein deficiency, a balanced diet would be a more natural way of doing this.
"5. The implication of paragraphs 2-4 above is that there is no need for individual amino acids as dietary supplements.
"6. Various rare diseases exist in which supplements of individual amino acids may be helpful. For example pellagra is a deficiency of the vitamin niacin. A very small percentage of ingested tryptophan is converted in the body into niacin. Thus, tryptophan supplements, as well as niacin supplements, are therapeutic in pellagra. In Hartnup's disease various amino acids are not properly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and amino acid supplements may be indicated. In rare diseases of this type, where amino acid supplements may be useful, it is important to note that (i) the deficiencies are not due to a simple amino acid deficiency in the diet (ii) patients suffering from these complaints should be treated by a physician. Thus, the existence of these rare diseases does not in any way support the idea that amino acids should be sold, as dietary supplements, to the general public.
"7. The major requirement for amino acids in humans is for making proteins in the body. However, some amino acids can be used for other purposes also. For example the amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine and histidine are all converted to neurotransmitters (the chemicals that pass messages between nerve cells) in the brain. The neurotransmitter formed from tryptophan is called 5-hydroxytryptamine or serotonin, those formed from phenylalanine and tyrosine are called dopamine and noradrenaline and that formed from histidine is called histamine.
"8. The levels of tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine and histidine in the brain can influence the amount in the brain of their product neurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and histamine.
"9. Alterations in neurotransmitter levels in the brain can influence mood and behaviour. Changes in behaviour after giving tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine and histidine have been seen in experimental animals. Tryptophan and tyrosine have also been shown to have behavioural effect in humans.
"10. The amino acids whose behavioral effects have been most widely studied is tryptophan. Tryptophan has the ability to elevate mood and is available in Britain
on prescription only
as an antidepressant under the brand names Optimax and Pacitron. It is also well established that tryptophan is a hypnotic: it reduces the time taken to fall asleep in subjects with mild insomnia. It has been tested and shows some promise in its ability to treat pain, decrease food intake and decrease pathological aggression. All these actions are thought to occur because of tryptophan's ability to increase the level of serotonin in the brain.
"11. When amino acids are given to influence behaviour they are being given not to correct any dietary deficiency but to increase the amount of their product neurotransmitter in the brain above its normal level. As such they are being given as drugs not as dietary supplements.
"12. When amino acids are given to influence behavior they are usually given at doses above their normal daily dietary intake. For example, the normal daily dietary intake of tryptophan is between 1 and 1.5 grams per day. It has been tested in humans at doses between 1 and 20 grams per day, with the normal dose as an antidepressant in the range of 4 to 6 grams per day. These doses are all ingested in addition to the normal daily dietary intake from food of 1 to 1.5 grams per day. Thus, there is no relationship between the amount of tryptophan given as a drug to influence behaviour and the amount normally ingested in food.
"13. The effects on the brain of amino acids taken in purified form can be different qualitatively from the effects of ingesting foods containing amino acids in protein. For example, giving tryptophan in purified form can raise brain tryptophan and serotonin levels. However, eating a meal that contains protein with tryptophan in it will lower brain tryptophan and serotonin. This is because amino acids do not pass freely from blood to brain. There is a system that takes tryptophan and various other amino acids and transports them actively from blood to brain. The various amino acids compete with each other for the transport system. An increase in the blood level of the amino acids which compete with tryptophan for entry into brain will decrease brain tryptophan and serotonin. Tryptophan in food is contained in protein. When a protein meal is eaten the increase in blood tryptophan is smaller than the increase in the level of the other amino acids which compete with tryptophan for entry into brain. This is because tryptophan is one of the least abundant amino acids in protein. The result is that less tryptophan gets into the brain. Therefore eating a meal containing tryptophan actually lowers brain tryptophan and serotonin. On the other hand eating a pure carbohydrate meal, which contains no protein, and therefore no tryptophan, will raise brain tryptophan and serotonin. This is because carbohydrate will lower the plasma level of some of the amino acids which compete with tryptophan for entry into brain. Thus, there are fundamental differences, as far as the effects on the brain are concerned, between eating a meal containing tryptophan and taking purified tryptophan.
"14. A further fundamental difference between ingesting amino acids as protein in food and ingesting them in purified form is that the purified amino acids can have toxic effects as detailed in paragraphs 15-21 below.
"15. Different food sources contain somewhat different proportions of amino acids. The body can adapt to these normal variations in amino acid intake. When purified amino acids are added to the diet there can be an imbalance in the amino acid pattern that the body cannot adequately cope with. Adverse effects ranging from moderate depressions of food intake and growth to the development of pathologic lesions in various tissues have been observed in experiments on animals ingesting diets containing an excessive amount of an individual amino acid. This effect of amino acid imbalance can occur with any amino acid and can be exacerbated by a low protein intake. Thus, humans should only take amino acid supplements when supervised by a physician and when their protein intake is adequate.
"16. All of the amino acids can, when given in purified form to experimental animals in a single sufficiently high dose, cause death. The pathological changes seen in these circumstances are similar for all the amino acids.
"17. Apart from the general toxic effects of amino acids described in sections 15 and 16 above, some individual amino acids have unique toxic effects which are sometimes only seen in special circumstances. Four examples are given in sections 18-21 below.
"18. When methionine in purified form is given to schizophrenic patients there is an exacerbation of symptomatology. The main effect is an increase in functional psychosis (disordered thinking).
"19. Individuals with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria are unable to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. The very high levels of phenylalanine in these individuals causes mental retardation. This can, to some extent, be prevented by diets low in phenylalanine. Phenylalanine supplements would be very damaging to such subjects.
"20. When tryptophan is added to the diet of the golden hamster there is a reduction in embryo and neonate survival. Obviously tryptophan supplements would be contra-indicated in pregnancy. The designation of tryptophan as a dietary supplement would certainly not convey to pregnant women the potential danger of ingesting tryptophan in purified form.
"21. When pure tryptophan is ingested by subjects who are already taking any of a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. Nardil and Parnate) side effects frequently occur. These include dizziness, nausea, headache, alcohol-like intoxication and clonus (muscletwitching).
"22. In summary, the data currently available indicate
(i) There are no situations in which dietary deficiencies of individual amino acids occur in humans. Thus, there is no need for individual amino acids to be sold as dietary supplements
(ii) Some amino acids are given because of their effects on neurotransmitters in the brain and therefore on mood or behaviour. In these situations they are given at doses above those found in the diet in order to manipulate the brain in a pharmacological manner. As such they are being given as drugs
(iii) Amino acids in purified form can have toxic effects which are not seen when amino acids are ingested as protein in the diet.
"23. In view of the facts given above it is my opinion that purified amino acids be treated as drugs rather than as dietary supplements.
"24. Attached as Exhibit 'B' hereto is a list of references on which the statements set out herein are based."
[126]
The plaintiffs' counsel's cross-examination of Prof. Young, although it was professionally skillful and resolutely pressed, did nothing in the general result toward impairing the expert's credibility, nor toward eliciting contradictions in the substance of his evidence. Prof. Young scrupulously declined to express opinions on matters outside his field of expertise. The Court finds Prof. Young's evidence to be credible.
[127]
Some portions of the cross-examination, conducted a few days prior to the trial herein (ex. 3), will serve as pertinent illustrations of the above finding:
"Q. Would it be fair to say that if you had insufficient protein intake that that might create within you an amino acid deficiency?
A. This comes down to a question of semantics, I think. No one would call a protein deficiency an amino acid deficiency.
Certainly a deficiency of protein could be overcome by giving an artificial mixture of all essential amino acids. And this is done in some clinical situations. For example, patients on total intravenous feeding are given a mixture of all ... of amino acids intravenously. And in that situation, they are receiving individual amino acids.
. . . . .
Q. Thank you.
A. So to carry on and finish what I was saying, a mixture of whatever word you want to use, isolated pure amino acids can in that situation restore protein deficiency; but it has to be a mixture of all essential amino acids.
An individual amino acid given to somebody, or a single amino acid given to somebody with a protein deficiency would have no beneficial effects whatsoever; and, in fact, would be more likely to have a detrimental effect than a therapeutic effect. And a mixture even of nine (9) or ten (10) essential amino acids would have a detrimental effect, not a therapeutic effect, for somebody deficient in protein.
Q. Really?
A. Yes.
. . . . .
Q. ... if I understood you correctly, Professor Young, you were saying that in your opinion you shouldn't take a single amino acid without the other nine (9) essential amino acids, or did I misunderstand you?
A. I was saying that you are not going to correct a protein deficiency except by taking a mixture of all essential amino acids. As to whether you should always avoid taking single amino acids, I think there are indications for taking single amino acids. I think they should be given under the supervision of a doctor. And an example is mentioned in this, is the use of tryptophan as an anti-depressant; it is available as an anti-depressant and is available as a prescription drug in Britain. And that is a situation where it might be advantageous to take a single amino acid. But in that situation, it is not correcting a nutritional deficiency; it is being given to stimulate the synthesis and the neuro transmitter in the brain; and that is entirely different from its role as a constituent of protein.
Q. To get back to my original question though, would there be circumstances under which the ordinary population of Canada would be justified in taking, in your opinion, a single amino acid which was not in combination with the other nine (9) essential amino acids?
A. Unless that amino acid had been approved as a drug, unless it was being given under the supervision of a physician, no."
(Exhibit 3, pages 10 to 14.)
[128]
Further in cross-examination, Prof. Young was shown all the exhibits 3(SY-1) through 3(SY-8) and interrogated about each one. Those exhibits are, or represent by label,
3(SY-1)
Equal
, among whose ingredients are aspertame, containing phenylalanine in compound with aspartic acid, a dipeptide, and silicon dioxide; (Prof. Young is aware of the literature on aspertame, having used it in his studies);
3(SY-2) Lalco's
garlic and parsley gelatin
, with "directions: four capsules daily" but no indication of its purpose or effect,
3(SY-3) Lalco's soya
Super Lecithin
in "gelcaps", a form of fat extracted from soya,
3(SY-4) Lalco's "natural source"
Bone Meal
, stated to be "Factor in the normal development and maintenance of bones and teeth" or "Contribue au développement normal des os et des dents", with "directions: four tablets daily",
3(SY-5) Palmer's
Live Brewer's Yeast
on whose label it is stated "... can be consumed by anyone", with directions for "normal use" and "shock treatment",
3(SY-6) Lalco's "spring harvest"
Pollen
, with "indications: as a natural food supplement" and "directions: two tablets 3 times daily",
3(SY-7) label for Pharmetics'
Pharma EPA
fish lipid concentrate, with "directions: as a dietary supplement of important omega 3 fatty acids - take three capsules daily with a meal",
3(SY-8) Lalco's
Dormiphen
tea, "an aid in sleep and relaxation",
Prof. Young asserted no particular expertise regarding the above mentioned products, but upon being asked, opined that none of them is a "drug", and that none of them is needed to supplement a normal diet.
[129]
He did, however, comment on the product Equal, thus:
"A. The amino acid in the Equal is present, as I said, not in pure form, it is present and is part of a larger compound, and it is that compound which has a sweet taste which makes it suitable as a sugar substitute. The amount of phenylalanine in Equal is very much smaller than the normal daily dietary intake, as I mentioned. For this reason, Equal is not, unless taken in extremely large quantities, going to affect neuro transmitters in the brain, which is my particular area of expertise. I am not qualified to talk ...
Q. Is it ...
A. ... talk authoritatively on the advantages of artificial sweeteners as weight loss aids and things like that.
What I can say, is that the detrimental effects of Equal are ...
Q. Well, if you ...
A. ... not likely to be due to the effect of the individual amino acids and their effect on the brain, because they are present in very small amounts. Except for the fact that in patients with phenylketonuria, who are particularly susceptible to phenylalanine, it could have a detrimental effect."
(Exhibit 3, page 20)
[130]
Whatever may be the effect of the plaintiffs' evidence whereby their witnesses swore that tryptophan can be obtained in the United Kingdom without prescription, it lacks specific substance. The Court accepts Prof. Young's sworn statement to the contrary because (a) he was specific in identifying two prescription-only drugs, Optimax and Pacitron; (b) he gave that specific information even before the trial commenced; and (c) he remains effectively uncontradicted in this regard, since the plaintiffs had time to impugn his evidence, had they wished or been able to do so, but they did not or could not contradict him by reference to Optimax or Pacitron, specific indices of his credibility. On the other hand the plaintiffs' evidence could be correct to the extent that it does not conflict with that of Prof. Young. This enquiry, however, concentrates on the use of any substance or mixture of substances in Canada. The sale of tryptophan under prescription in the U.K. serves only to accord weight to the defendants' contentions about its use and about their apprehensions in that regard.
[131]
An example of the manner in which the HPB applies the impugned Food and Drug Regulations in order to safeguard the public from the possible dangers of an untried substance and the dangers of misrepresentation by silence in regard thereto, is amply demonstrated in the exchange of correspondence between R.A. Armstrong, M.D., the Assistant Director and Chief, Drug Evaluation Division, Bureau of Non-prescription Drugs and Mr. P.K. Dixit, Manager, New Product Development and Consumer Service, of the plaintiff, Jamieson. Copies of the correspondence were tendered, on mutual consent, as exhibits 1(E-6), 1(E-7) and 1(E-8).
[132]
Exhibit 1(E-8), a copy of Mr. Dixit's letter of February 23, 1984, to Dr. Armstrong and received by him on March 5, that year, runs thus:
"Re: L-CARNITINE
With reference to your letter of February 13th, 1984 [exhibit 1(E-7)] ...
This product will be sold as a dietary supplement, for which no claim will be made.
Further to your enquiry,
'How will a person know he needs this amino acid'? vis,
This is in the same way that a person knows that he requires l-lysine and l-tryptophane, which is being sold in the same fashion. Absolutely no claims will be made. These products are only sold as amino acid supplement. Unless there is some evidence to indicate that l-carnitine is a dangerous drug and (to our knowledge it is not), we see no reason why this product cannot be marketed.
And furthermore re your other question, 'How this product helps a person?'
Again we shall not make any drug claim. If beneficial claims are made for this product then it becomes a new drug and it is not our intention to create a new drug out of a food supplement.
Thanking you in advance for your co-operation."
Dr. Armstrong responded by letter dated April 4, 1984, (ex. 1(E-6)) as follows:
"I have for acknowledgement your letter of February 23, 1984, concerning the product L-CARNITINE. I must say that your letter does not deal adequately with the points raised in my letter of February 13, 1984.
The fact that you propose to make no claim on the label of the proposed product does not satisfactorily address the matter. L-CARNITINE is not an essential amino acid and there would be no point in a person supplementing his diet with it except for the pharmacological properties which it possesses. All physical entities which, in theory, might benefit from the administration of L-CARNITINE are conditions which can only be diagnosed by a physician and which are not suitable for self-medication.
Since in the view of the Health Protection Branch, the safety and effectiveness of persons taking L-CARNITINE have not been established and since products containing L-CARNITINE have not been sold in Canada for sufficient time and in sufficient quantity to establish in Canada the safety and effectiveness of such products, they are considered to be New Drugs subject to Division 8 of Part C of the Food and Drug Regulations."
It can be seen that although the plaintiff Jamieson was prepared to disseminate L-carnitine in Canada without any representation as to its use, Dr. Armstrong contended that its principal, if not only, known use is for its pharmacological properties in conditions which can only be diagnosed by a physician. He invited the plaintiff in his previous letter (ex. 1(E-7)) to provide more data.
[133]
So, despite the plaintiff's intended scrupulous silence about the use of L-carnitine, it was apparent to Dr. Armstrong at least until more data were supplied, that it could be "manufactured" and "sold" only "for use in (a) the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or [perhaps, even] prevention of a disease, disorder, abnormal physical state, or the symptoms thereof in man or animal, [or] (b) restoring, correcting or modifying organic functions in man or animal". Thus the plaintiff's silence in regard to claims would itself be problematic. It is apparent that until the plaintiff produced everything it knew or ought reasonably to have known about the "pharmacological properties of L-carnitine" it was properly, and in accordance with the Regulations, regarded not only as a "drug" but, indeed, a "new drug". In interpreting the Food and Drugs Act and its Regulations in accordance with sections 11, 14 and 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, the Court finds that Dr. Armstrong's approach was in perfect accord with the objects, purposes and intent of the legislation. The Court's perception of those objects, purposes and intent may be alternatively stated to say that the people of Canada are not to serve as the intended, or even unintended, guinea pigs or livestock of the manufacturers and merchants of drugs.
[134]
It is enough for the defendants to raise reasonable questions about the safety and effectiveness of substances which in their manufactured formulation, and claimed uses if any, have, or are represented as having, the properties mentioned in Dr. Armstrong's letters (exhibits 1(E-6) and 1(E-7)) and the uses described in the Act. It is then for the manufacturer or other applicant to come forward with all the available information known in medical and pharmaceutical circles, about those substances. That is the law. Although reg. C.08.001 could be more felicitously drawn, it can reasonably be interpreted in regard to "sufficient time and in sufficient quantity" to permit the defendants to require "new drug" submissions for already identified substances or products in regard to which research has discovered previously unknown and unsuspected properties.
[135]
Mr. Ferrier's evidence on examination for discovery held August 16, 1985, in the afternoon, pages 79 to 90, being questions and answers 216 to 254, indicates how and why the plaintiff Jamieson's application for a DIN for the product as it was proposed was declined. According to the jointly admitted facts, it was in December, 1983, that this plaintiff applied concerning "a vitamin, mineral and amino acid product, which it proposed to sell under the brand name, Mega Stress". See exhibit 1(E-35). At first, the representations effected through the label were found to create "an erroneous impression regarding the composition of the product" (ex. 1(E-36)). Subsequently, and indeed after the institution of this action in suit no. T-2853-84, the defendants at last focussed upon the ingredient L-tryptophan and took the position that they could not accord a DIN, but that Jamieson ought either to consider eliminating the tryptophan from its formula, or alternatively, to explain, by making a new drug submission, why that amino acid needed to be included.
[136]
In the result, after the institution of the first action, by Jamieson alone (T-2853-84), the Director's objection to the name Stress Ease, but not to the composition of the proposed product, was withdrawn. That is established in the examination of Mr. Ferrier for discovery, held on August 16, 1985, afternoon session, pages 67 and 68, questions and answers 177 through 183. Approval of the issuance of a DIN for the product, without tryptophan, under the trade name Stress Ease was accorded. (Para. 49, Joint ... Facts for T-2853-84.) However, on November 14, 1984, the Director's staff informed this plaintiff "that all isolated amino acids and in combinations other than in proportions 'normally' found in recognized food proteins were now [i.e. then] considered to be New Drugs". (Para. 38, Joint ... Facts for T-2853-84.)
[137]
It is certainly true as the parties all agree that some other isolated amino acids are treated by the defendants as foods and sales, as such, will be permitted so long as no drug claims are made. Those amino acids are those other than tryptophan, arginine, ornithine, phenylalanine, methionine, tyrosine, lysine and carnitine, listed in paragraph 22 of the amended statement of defence (T-2968-84). In fact, some products of other manufacturers, containing isolated amino acids (arginine, lysine and even tryptophan) in combination with other substances, have received DINs prior to July, 1981, since prior to that date they were not considered by the regulators to be new drugs. The significance of the month of July, 1981, resides in the fact that the present DIN system came into existence in July, 1981, and the Bureau of Non-Prescription Drugs was formed only in the previous year.
[138]
When the plaintiff Jamieson applied, in December, 1983, for a DIN regarding its proposed product Mega Stress, now known as Stress Ease, but with tryptophan then included, it is clear that the Director (or his staff) concentrated principally on the intended labelling and did not regard it with the same scientific scrutiny as was evinced by Dr. Armstrong in regard to the carnitine matter later in 1984. It was only in April, 1984, that the defendants decided to refer the inclusion of tryptophan to the Drug Evaluation Division. (Exhibit 1(E-42). In fact that the last document in exhibit 1(E-43) shows Dr. Armstrong, on April 11, 1984, asking Jamieson to explain the reason for including tryptophan in its proposed product. Dr. Armstrong appears to be the most perspicacious among the defendants' officials.
[139]
There is nothing sinister or unlawful in asking the manufacturer to state why that or any substance of pharmacological properties needs to be included. On the evidence, principally that of Prof. Young, it is established that Jamieson's product was properly subjected to the new drug Regulations. Tryptophan can produce behavioural effects by altering mood. It is surely common knowledge, of which the Court may take notice, that it is not only the narcotic or other prohibited drugs, but any mood-altering substances which affect a person's ability to hold a job, to hold a baby and to drive a car. The tryptophan in the proposed new product, said to ease stress, meant that it could properly be found on the evidence to require more information as to its safety and effectiveness. The Court concludes that Jamieson's proposed product was, is and ought to be correctly classified as a new drug. That being so, the denial of a drug identification number to permit dissemination of the product to consumers in Canada was amply justified, and lawful.
[140]
The defendants, in November, 1984, took the position (exhibit 1(E-28)) that all isolated amino acids and the same in combinations other than in proportions "normally" found in recognized food proteins were thenceforth to be considered to be new drugs. To the extent that this position represented a change of regulatory policy it was legitimate so to change it, within the limits set by the Act and Regulations. After a delay of some six months, in May, 1985, the HPB issued an "Information Letter/Lettre de reseignements" addressed at large to all food and drug manufacturers, importers and distributors as well as consumer advocacy groups. That circular letter stated the HPB's new policy over the signature of A.J. Liston, Ph.D., Assistant Deputy Minister. A copy of it is before the Court, on consent of the parties, as exhibit 1(E-10). At 5 1/4 pages in bilingual format, it is too long to recite here. The Court finds the content of that Information Letter to be uncontradicted on the evidence, as well as logical, reasonable and lawful.
[141]
The specific passages of that Information Letter which bear on the question of whether certain amino acids, alone, or in combinations or in a mixture, are truly new drugs, ought to be noted:
"AMINO ACIDS AS DRUGS
"Products containing single amino acids or mixtures of amino acids which have demonstrated pharmacological effects or for which drug claims are made or implied are considered to be drugs as defined in section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act.
"The amino acids highlighted in the following paragraphs, whether in the d,1 or d1 isomeric forms are considered to be drugs. With the exceptions specified for methionine, all are considered to be new drugs subject to the requirements of Division 8 of Part C of the Food and Drugs Regulations. Evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product when used as directed is required and claims for supplementation of a specific amino acid should be supported by adequate information on the deficiency state and the contribution of the supplement to its prevention. The Emergency Drug Release program and preclinical new drug submissions have been utilized and will continue to be available to provide many of these drugs to physicians.
"These policies are applicable to amino acids and their salts whether used in the manufacturing process as complexing agents or included in product formulations as other nonmedicinal ingredients.
"Tryptophan
"This amino acid is under study in relation to its sedative properties, in the treatment of depression, psychotic disorders, rheumatic pain and migraine headaches.
"Arginine and Ornithine
"Both arginine and ornithine have been claimed to provoke the release of insulin and increase serum levels of growth hormone (somatotropin).
"Combinations of these two amino acids, with or without lysine, are promoted without substantiation, to burn off fat and produce an anabolic effect by stimulating the secretion of growth hormone.
"Phenylalanine
"It has been studied in cases of depression unresponsive to other treatments, and side effects of headache and vertigo have been reported. Phenylalanine is reported to have anti-inflammatory action and to be beneficial in treating arthritis.
"Mental retardation due to the accumulation of this amino acid in the blood-stream has been observed in persons with phenylketonuria (PKU).
"Methionine
"This amino acid has been included for many years in vitamin/mineral products in association with choline and inositol, often under the designation of 'lipotropic factor'. As a single active ingredient it has sometimes been used as a urinary acidifier. Methionine, when recommended for these specified uses, is considered to be a drug but not a new drug.
"Methionine is generally considered to be the most toxic of the amino acids with a comparatively narrow range between deficiency and toxicity in animal experiments.
"Tyrosine
"Tyrosine has been studied for use in psychiatry, and is reported to influence the synthesis of catecholamines.
"Lysine
"This amino acid has been reputed to be effective in suppressing and controlling herpes viruses but the results of studies are inconclusive. Lysine hydrochloride has been studied for use in the treatment of hypochloremic alkalosis but requires caution, paticularly where there is impaired renal function.
"Carnitine
"This trimethyl betaine derivative, although lacking the alpha amino group that is present in the 20 amino acids found in food proteins, is perceived by the public as an amino acid.
"Carnitine is included in this listing of drugs subject to the new drug Regulations because it has been extensively used in the management of a wide variety of severe metabolic disorders and experimentally in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.
"Reference will be made available on receipt of a written request."
(Exhibit 1(E-10) pp. 3 to 6)
[142]
It is obvious that the HPB, in accordance with the objects and purposes of the legislation, and in light of new and ongoing research findings and discoveries in the field of biochemistry, legitimately changed its approach to new drugs, and amino acids in particular, in order to evince greater prudence in the public interest. After all, reg. C.08.001 relates not only to substances which may well have been identified and even consumed for a long time; but it also relates to what from time to time is known about those substances through newly developed perceptions about them in new combinations, and to the claims for which they are to be administered, and by what route, all in regard to safety and effectiveness. The defendants' criteria in this administration are set out, but not exhaustively in exhibits 1(E-4), (E-9) and of course (E-10).
[143]
It is not to the point that beverage alcohol and coffee may, when excessively consumed, produce deleterious effects. Quite probably our society would be better off without them. They, inter alia, are traditionally implanted in our society and, as the alcohol prohibition era demonstrated, it is extremely difficult, if not virtually impossible, to roll back and eradicate the consumption of beverage alcohol in Canadian society. The strict enforcement of the narcotics laws evinces an attempt to prevent consumption of such drugs from becoming similarly implanted in Canadian society. That is a legitimate matter of policy. So also is it with the stricter administration of the food and drugs legislation, even although one can readily understand that amino acids would not be so likely to attract those who seek quick temporary oblivion as are alcohol and the forbidden narcotic drugs. These considerations do not detract from the legitimacy of the administration and enforcement of the food and drug legislation. The issues here concern those substances which the defendants have perceived are new drugs pursuant to the Regulations, and not those substances which they have not - or have not yet - considered in that regard. The Act and the Regulations evince the legislative intent to keep abreast of scientific research and discovery and not to become archaic with the passage of time. They can constitutionally override manufacturers' putative rights of property since such are not entrenched in the Charter.
[144]
The Court finds on the evidence that the defendants were lawfully correct in identifying as truly new drugs, when alone or in combinations other than found in food proteins, as the case may be, the following substances:
Tryptophan
Arginine
Phenylalanine
Methionine
Ornithine
Tyrosine
Lysine
Carnitine
Histidine
The last item above is not mentioned in the trial record, but is considered to be truly a drug by Prof. Young in his affidavit. In that regard, it must be borne in mind that the above list is not to be taken to be exhaustive. No one should argue that this Court found these alone to be correctly characterized as new drugs. The first eight amino acids listed above are the ones which are subject to contention in these actions, but they do not constitute a crystallized list, to which nothing can ever be added. According to paragraph 23 of the statement of defence (T-2968-84), other isolated amino acids will be treated as foods and sale as such will be permitted, provided that no drug claims are made. To which must be added, for purposes of the Court's interpretation of the new drug Regulations and disposition of the issues: for the time being, and unless and until pharmacological properties therein be discovered, if ever, or while long term safety effects thereof be found to be at least innocuous, if so.
IV. Were the Regulations regarding new drugs applied in an unfair, unreasonable and/or discriminatory manner?
[145]
The whole answer to the question is "no", but if the adjectival ingredients, "disorganized", "incompetent" and "confused" were substituted in the question it would require an affirmative answer. These latter ingredients are not justiciable in regard to an action in which negligence or malice is not alleged and in which there is no consequent claim for damages, but they may and will be taken into account in awarding costs of the action.
[146]
It may be contended that the Regulations were applied unreasonably because of the defendants' confusion and false starts. But the plaintiffs were subjected not to oppression, which the Court would be vigilant to quash, but rather to misdirection and apparent confusion or incompetence.
[147]
Some examples may be found among the defendants' own admissions.
[148]
In regard to Jamieson's action (T-2853-84), the Amended Joint Admission of Facts contains the following, with certain other information and observations included:
"21. On or about December 19, 1983, Plaintiff [Jamieson] wrote to the ... HPB, Attention Mr. P..., enclosing certain information in order to obtain drug identification number for a vitamin, mineral and amino acid product which it proposed to sell under the brand name Mega Stress. Copy of this letter is produced as Exhibit [1(E-35)].
"22. On or about February 6, 1984, ... Director's [staff member] Mrs. H... Q..., ... wrote to Plaintiff advising it that her review of the label for the said product indicated that certain revisions were necessary for it to be in compliance with the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. Consequently, it has been recommended that the DIN not be issued for the said product until a revised copy of the label was received. Among the reasons invoked for recommending against the issuance of the DIN was the fact that:
'The term "Mega" is considered inappropriate for the formulation of this product. Furthermore, as the product contains the minerals, Zinc, Magnesium and Calcium, in addition to B & C vitamins, the product trade name is considered misleading, in violation of section 9(1) of the Food and Drugs Act, in creating an erroneous impression regarding the composition of the product, and should be suitably revised.'
[and the following, too]
'It should be clearly shown on the label that the phrase "In a base of: L-Tryptophane ... 30 mg., bee pollen extract rose hips and dolomite", refers to non-medicinal ingredients.'"
(Exhibit 1(E-36))
This reply was a long time in coming. It was formulated by a different official from the one to whom the plaintiff applied, and it refers to the proposed brand name and further insists that the tryptophan be referred to as a nonmedicinal ingredient. The defendants, as above noted, were concentrating on labels, and brand names. As a result, the plaintiff changed the proposed name to Vita Stress and revised the label. (Exhibit 1 (E-37)).
"On or about March 7, 1984, Mrs. H... Q... wrote again to Plaintiff advising, in part, as follows:
. . . . .
'A review of the revised label indicates that the following revision is necessary for the label to be in compliance with the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations:
1. There has been no objection to the term "Stress" as used to indicate a formulation incorporating Vitamins B and C. However, a trade name such as "Vita Stress" to describe a product including more than Vitamins B and C is considered to create a false impression regarding the composition of the product, in contravention of subsection 9(1) of the Food and Drugs Act and is not acceptable unless suitably revised to indicate the total formulation such as "Stress Formula plus Minerals".
'Therefore, it has been recommended that the DIN not be issued for this product until a revised copy of the label is received.'"
(Exhibit 1(E-38).)
The plaintiff then wrote to Mrs. H... Q... to advise that it had further revised the proposed name to Vita Stress plus Minerals. (Exhibit 1(E-39).) Considering its competitive position, the plaintiff further notified the HPB through a Mrs. E... R... of another change of brand name, to Stress Ease plus Vitamins and Minerals. (Exhibit 1(E-41).) Mrs. H... Q... responded on April 11, 1984, stating that this latest name was not acceptable and was in contravention of section 9(1) of the Act. This letter marks the glimmering of the new policy. (Exhibit 1(E-42).) Dr. Armstrong's letter seeking an explanation for including tryptophan (exhibit 1(E-43) bears the same date.
[149]
Much correspondence followed. (Exhibit 1 (E-43)). On November 27, 1984, Ms. P... W... of the HPB wrote Jamieson to say that all single amino acids and combinations other than in proportions normally found in food proteins were then considered to be new drugs. (Exhibit 1(E-28).)
"31. On or about December 6, 1984, the present action was instituted.
"32. Subsequent to the institution of the present proceedings [T-2853-84], Defendants, through their legal counsel, advised Plaintiff that the name Stress Ease plus Vitamins and Minerals itself caused no problem and could be used. However, because the product to which the name was to be ascribed was to contain the amino acid L-Tryptophan, Defendants took the position that the product was a new drug for the purposes of Section C.08.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations."
So, at last, almost one year after Jamieson first sought a DIN, the real, final reason for declining it was made known. That occurred only about a week before the lawsuit (T-2853-84) was started. It is true that the plaintiff might have sensed that more stringent administration of the Act and Regulations had commenced, as a conclusion to be drawn from other correspondence starting in April, 1984, (e.g. Exhibit 1(E-33) and (E-43).) Nevertheless, the plaintiff was enveloped in the defendant's shifting policies and was requested (exhibit 1(E-28)) to cease selling amino acid products in late November, 1984, but declined to do so. On December 17, 1984, eleven days after action T-2853-84 was instituted, the defendants' inspectors entered Jamieson's premises and seized the amino acid products listed in exhibit 1(E-29) represented by 14 official forms of Notice of Seizure. Subsequently the defendants partially relented and lifted the seizure of products except as to those found herein to have been lawfully designated as new drugs, histidine being not there and then involved.
[150]
In regard to the second action in which Jamieson, Swiss Herbal and Pharmetics are plaintiffs (T-2968-84), the Amended Joint Admission of Facts contains the following, with certain other information and observations included:
"3. Plaintiff Swiss Herbal Remedies Ltd. started selling isolated amino acids and amino acid products in Canada as early as February 1980, and has been doing so ever since;
"4. Plaintiff Pharmetics Ltd. started manufacturing and selling isolated amino acids and amino acid products in Canada as early as January 1980, and has been doing so ever since;
"5. Plaintiff Pharmetics Ltd. produces for, and sells to Plaintiff Swiss Herbal Remedies Ltd., and others, isolated amino acids and amino acid products and Plaintiff, Swiss Herbal Remedies Ltd., therefore, is affected by the foregoing and by the seizures hereinafter referred to;
"28. On or about November 26, 1984, Plaintiff Swiss Herbal ... was advised by [... staff officials P... W... and D... W...] that all isolated amino acids and in combinations other than in proportions 'normally' found in recognized food proteins were now considered to be New Drugs. This information was confirmed by said P... W... by letter of November 27, 1984, in which she concluded as follows:
'Section C.08.002 of the Food and Drug Regulations prohibits the sale of new drugs in Canada unless a new drug submission has been filed by the manufacturer and a Notice of Compliance in respect to that new drug submission has been issued by the Minister.'
the whole as appears more fully from a copy of said letter;
"31. On December 17, 1984, Defendant Director's employees, on behalf of the Drug and Environmental Health Inspection Division attended the premises of ... Swiss Herbal ... and advised it to continue withholding all marketing of isolated amino acids and amino acid products for the reason that they had been declared New Drugs and could not be marketed and should not be marketed until Plaintiff had complied with the provisions of Section C.08.001 and following governing New Drugs."
All three plaintiffs point to certain products of other manufacturers (exhibit 1(E-25)) which contain isolated amino acids already noted herein in combination with other substances, and which have been accorded DINs prior to July, 1981 since, prior thereto they were not considered to be new drugs. Is there any wonder the plaintiffs sensed that they were being subjected to arbitrary treatment? They were all affected by the defendants' legitimate, but diffuse, shift of regulatory policy, which the Regulations nevertheless permitted.
[151]
Misgivings about the confusion on the defendants' part during that time are generated by further admissions of fact common to both actions:
"Only manufacturers that apply for a DIN on a product, or manufacturers who request a decision on the status of a product, are normally advised that a product is a new drug." (para. 16 - T-2853-84; para. 19 - T-2968-84)
"Under Defendants' present policy DINs are issued for products, not substances;" (para. 20 - T-2853-84; para. 23 - T-2968-84)
This latter policy is confusing. It excludes from regulation certain, perhaps myriads, of the drugs which are not in mixtures or combinations, because drugs are defined primarily to be "substances".
"'Balanced' combinations of amino acids sold
in capsule form
are considered by the Drugs Directorate to be foods in the absence of drug claims;" (para. 46 - T-2853-84; para. 37 - T-2968-84)
"Defendants do not know at what dosage levels, if any, the amino acids in the present case begin to produce therapeutic or pharmacological effects;" (para. 48 - T-2853-84; para. 39 - T-2968-84)
This fact, while seeming to propagate confusion, probably bears reference to a myriad of other factors, such as patient's general health and weight, dosage administered, method or route, and the effect of any and all other drugs or substances which may be mixed or combined with those amino acids, or which the patient may be also taking.
"Isolated amino acids, when added to foods are not considered by the Drug Directorate as drugs, but the isolated amino acids listed in paragraph 22 of the Defence in T-2968-84 and still under seizure are considered drugs when sold as single amino acids. (para. 50 - T-2853-84; para. 41 - T-2968-84)
"Except for the amino acids listed in E-1, the Bureau of Non-Prescription Drugs does not know why the other products listed in the Statement of Claim (T-2853-84 and T-2968-84) were seized;"
Now that is remarkable! It appears to have been an isolated incident, borne more of incompetence than oppression or malice, of which latter there is no evidence here. Indeed, in view of the foregoing and since the defendants later partially relented, the Court will not in this regard alone make the declarations that the Regulations were applied in a manner which "is unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory to the point of creating a flagrant injustice", as the plaintiffs seek.
[152]
The answers given by Mr. Ferrier on examination for discovery indicate that the defendants could have been more helpful to the plaintiffs and others in their position. Asked how long his bureau considered isolated amino acids to be new drugs, Mr. Ferrier answered that it could only be since 1980, "but certainly all that period of time". (Discovery transcript; May 10, 1985, pp. 72 and 73, Q. & A. 241). However, it seems that the defendants only got around to informing the industry about their view on May 3, 1985, (a few days before Mr. Ferrier testified on discovery), through the Information Letter, exhibit 1(E-10). The contents of the Information Letter seem to be most helpful, but the delay from 1980 to 1985 was not helpful to anyone.
[153]
At his examination for discovery continued on August 16, 1985, morning session, Mr. Ferrier indicated on page 29 that there was an apparently overwhelming volume of new drug decisions made in late 1984 and early 1985, because he doubted that the Assistant Deputy Minister Dr. Liston, was ever advised that the single amino acids referred to in Dr. Armstrong's letter were in new drug status. In fact, exhibit 1(E-26) shows that "only seven isolated amino acids will continue to be administered as drugs. Carnitine is also being treated as a drug". Exhibit 1(E-26) is dated February 27, 1985, that is, after commencement of these actions, but more than two months before the Information Letter to the industry. The inference to be drawn from this is that the HPB was probably under-staffed and over-worked and consequently in a state of confusion at the time.
[154]
The confusion persists. On August 16, 1985, afternoon, Mr. Ferrier is reported at pages 59 to 62 to be asserting that Jamieson's application for a DIN was not refused; but the transcript for September 16, 1985, Q. & A. 2, reveals that Jamieson's first application was indeed refused because the proposed product contained tryptophan. However a second application for Stress Ease without tryptophan was accorded a DIN.
[155]
By May 20, 1986, the defendants were seen to be recovering from their confusion, for on that date another Information Letter signed by the Assistant Deputy Minister (exhibit 6) stated that the HPB "intends to establish an Expert Advisory Committee on amino acids to review available information and provide advice respecting" generally the safety and effectiveness of those substances "particularly if consumed over a prolonged period of time". Interested parties were invited to make representations on those issues. It is a reasonable inference that these lawsuits spurred the HPB into focussing its attention upon the need to achieve a controlled approach to concerns of its clients about amino acid products.
[156]
The plaintiffs complain that once the HPB had decided that seven of the isolated amino acid products (eight, including carnitine) were "new drugs", it did not apply this decision uniformly to all manufacturers of such products. Whereas the plaintiffs were stopped from selling those products finally in December, 1984, other manufacturers were not so ordered until May, 1985, by the Information Letter, exhibit 1(E-10). It must be remembered in this regard that the plaintiffs did not prove and are not claiming damages in regard to that five-month period. They claim, rather, a declaration of "flagrant injustice". Retailers were, however, accorded a two-year grace period to exhaust their stock, as may be seen by the HPB's letter (exhibit 9) of September 25, 1986. That letter informed retailers that the period of grace had expired "on receipt of this letter", patently several months short of the two-year period mentioned therein.
[157]
The plaintiffs are seeking judicial review of a discretionary administrative action. That is how the legal issue should be framed even if there is a strong inference that the defendants were in a state of disarray, having apparently bitten off more than they could chew at the material times. The law relevant to this issue is clear. The decision-maker must not exceed or otherwise abuse the discretionary authority. The regulator, here the HPB, must not act in bad faith (in the sense of self-interest, or undue favour or animosity), must not promote purposes alien to the purpose, intent, spirit or letter of the legislation or against public policy, and must have regard only to all pertinent considerations. As earlier indicated herein policies, within the bounds of the Act and Regulations, do not need to be set in ancient concrete. In practice, such decision-makers are not bound to their previous decisions or past policies. Generally however, an unexplained or inexplicable, or disproportionate, departure from previous policy can raise strong inference of bad faith, improper purpose, irrelevant considerations or gross unreasonableness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the plaintiffs' complaint and the defendants' conduct, the evidence does not establish that the new drug Regulations were applied in an unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory manner. The plaintiffs produced nothing to show that the reason for which they were told to stop manufacturing and selling the products in question before other manufacturers were so told, was based on anything other than the HPB's more complete familiarity with the plaintiffs' proposed products than with the others' as a result of Jamieson's contemporaneous DIN application. The HPB's shift of policy generated some disarray within the Branch. It is not unreasonable to find that this or any large bureaucratic administration would need a period of time to convert its first response, precipitated by its changing policy, into industry-wide compliance through final formulation of the policy, and then to publish it. The plaintiffs happened to apply at the dawn of the changed policy. However, it is a fact that the defendants did move to apply the new policy across the whole industry. There is absolutely no evidence of any inexplicable inconsistency or failure of the defendants or their officials to follow their new policy.
[159]
In regard to Jamieson's claim in action T-2853-84, it is seeking an order directing the Director to issue a DIN for the product "Stress Ease with Vitamins and Minerals". This claim remained as an adjunct of the claim for a declaration stating the unfairness, unreasonableness and discrimination of the manner of applying the Regulations. This claim so remained in the plaintiff Jamieson's amended statement of claim filed on December 16, 1986. Since such claim so remains, even after the Director approved a DIN for the plaintiff's product, without tryptophan, under the name "Stress Ease", the plaintiff evidently seeks a DIN for a product which contains tryptophan. Such claim must be dismissed. The Director is justified in considering such a product with tryptophan to be a new drug under regulation C.08.001.
[160]
Consequently, the declaration which the plaintiffs' seek will not be made. However, because the policy was somewhat modified and the defendants consequently relented somewhat, after the commencement of these actions, the plaintiffs ought to be compensated by being excused from paying the defendants' costs which would ordinarily follow the disposition of the issues.
V. CHARTER APPLICATION: Did the search and seizure pursuant to section 22 of the Food and Drugs Act violate the plaintiffs' right guaranteed by section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and is that section 22 itself violative of such right?
[161]
The plaintiffs, in action T-2968-84, pray for a declaration that the search of Jamieson's premises and the seizure of its isolated amino acid products by the defendants' inspectors violated section 8 of the Charter. Swiss Herbal's premises were visited on the same day as the inspectors seized Jamieson's products. The inspectors advised Swiss Herbal to continue to keep from the market all isolated amino acids and such products until the plaintiff complied with reg. C.08.001 and following, regarding new drugs. (Amended Joint ... Facts in T-2968-84, para. 31.) For the purposes of this issue Swiss Herbal, although not a manufacturer, is considered to be in the same plight as is Jamieson.
[162]
The plaintiffs urge that section 22 of the Food and Drugs Act, pursuant to which the search and seizure were effected, contravened section 8 of the Charter at the material time. Section 22 was later amended, but at the material time it ran thus:
"PART II ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
"Powers of Inspectors
"22(1) An inspector may at any reasonable time
(a) enter any place where on reasonable grounds he believes any article to which this Act or the Regulations apply is manufactured, prepared, preserved, packaged or stored, examine any such article and take samples thereof, and examine anything that he reasonably believes is used or capable of being used for such manufacture, preparation, preservation, packaging or storing;
(b) open and examine any receptacle or package that on reasonable grounds he believes contains any article to which this Act or the Regulations apply;
(c) examine any books, documents or other records found in any place mentioned in paragraph (a) that on reasonable grounds he believes contain any information relevant to the enforcement of this Act with respect to any article to which this Act or the Regulations apply and make copies thereof or extracts therefrom; and
(d) seize and detain for such time as may be necessary any article by means of or in relation to which he reasonably believes any provision of this Act or the Regulations has been violated.
"22(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the expression 'article to which this Act or the Regulations apply' includes
(a) any food, drug, cosmetic or device,
(b) anything used for the manufacture, preparation, preservation, packaging or storing thereof, and
(c) any labelling or advertising material.
"22(3) An inspector shall be furnished with a prescribed certificate of designation and on entering any place pursuant to subsection (1) shall if so required produce the certificate to the person in charge thereof.
"22(4) The owner or person in charge of a place entered by an inspector pursuant to subsection (1) and every person found therein shall give the inspector all reasonable assistance in his power and furnish him with such information as he may reasonably require.
"22(5) No person shall obstruct an inspector in the carrying out of his duties under this Act or the Regulations.
"22(6) No person shall knowingly make any false or misleading statement either verbally or in writing to any inspector engaged in carrying out his duties under this Act or the Regulations.
"22(7) No person shall remove, alter or interfere in any way with any article seized under this Act without the authority of an inspector.
"22(8) Any article seized under this Act may at the option of an inspector be kept or stored in the building or place where it was seized or may at the direction of an inspector be removed to any other proper place."
[163]
Section 8 of the Charter guarantees that:
"Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure."
[164]
The plaintiffs focus on the legislation. They do not allege any misconduct whatsoever on the part of the inspectors. Relating the provisions of section 22 back to the new drug Regulations, the plaintiffs argue that no decision or conduct to search and seize could ever be reasonable, because the allegedly vague new drug Regulations preclude any inspector from ever having "reasonable grounds to believe" that new drugs are being "manufactured, prepared, preserved, packaged or stored". Alleged vagueness aside, the Regulations' complexity could present certain difficulties in this regard. Furthermore, the plaintiffs note, section 22 does not require that inspectors obtain prior authorization from an independent authority in order to search and seize.
[165]
The defendants acknowledge that section 22 purports to authorize warrantless searches and seizures, but their counsel submits that these are situations or conditions in which the requirement for prior authorization would itself be unreasonable. The defendants aver that the statutory authority is reasonable in itself and does not contravene section 8 of the Charter.
[166]
The witness Eric Margolis, the chief executive officer of the plaintiff Jamieson, recalled that "when this case started to develop and ... all of a sudden one day the HPB inspectors marched into my office and informed us in the case of tryptophan that this product was a new drug and not a food", (transcript 1, p. 82). He did not testify about the impugned search and seizure of which Jamieson complains. The evidence concerning that event is found in paragraph 30 of the Amended Joint Admission of Facts in action T-2968-84, thus:
"30. On December 17, 1984, Defendant Director's employees, on behalf of the Drug and Environmental Health Inspection Division, entered Plaintiff C.E. Jamieson & Co. (Dominion) Ltd.'s premises and seized the amino acid products listed in the documents of seizure produced herewith in [exhibit 1(E-29)]".
The joint admission mentions only Jamieson's "premises": it does not indicate that anyone's private office was searched for purposes of the seizures. Exhibit 1(E-29), rather, shows that multiple cases (packing boxes?) and bottles of products, valued at several thousands of dollars, were seized: that is, quantities which, by inference, would not have been placed in Mr. Margolis' or anyone else's private office. That inference and the lack of contrary evidence induce the Court to find that no office was searched by the defendants' inspectors. This conclusion applies equally to Swiss Herbal whose "premises" alone are mentioned, from which no articles were physically taken.
[167]
The plaintiffs' counsel reiterated more than once during the trial that the plaintiffs make absolutely no complaint about the conduct of the defendants' inspectors during this search, if such there really was, and seizure and of the products. Based on those acknowledgments by counsel, the Court finds that the inspectors went about their task in a manner which was adequately polite, pragmatic, professional and not offensive to anyone.
[168]
Section 22 of the Food and Drugs Act is to be considered in this light. Did the inspectors have reasonable grounds to believe that Jamieson's premises were a place where any article to which the Act or Regulations apply is manufactured, prepared, packaged or stored? No doubt they did. Paragraph 22(1)(a) of the Act accords them power of inspection. Did the inspectors reasonably believe that what they seized were the means or effect by which any provision of the Act or the Regulations had been violated? Possibly the inspectors or those who despatched them did so reasonably believe, but in the absence of a sworn information or like document to induce issuance of a warrant, it is not certain whether their beliefs could have been reasonable or not. This latter matter of violation of the Act or Regulations was surely a contentious question between the parties, because only 11 days before the inspectors' seizure, Jamieson had filed its statement of claim to initiate action T-2853-84, on December 6, 1984. Paragraph 22(1)(d) of the Act accords the power of warrantless seizure and it exacts reasonable belief that the Act or Regulations has been violated.
[169]
Mr. Ferrier examined for discovery, and speaking for the defendants, gave these binding answers:
"Q. And before seizing in the hands of Jamieson, the amino acids which you did seize, you didn't attempt to find out from Jamieson for how long they had been selling and in what quantity they had been selling?
A. No that was not done."
(August 16, 1985, afternoon, page 29)
The violation, of which reasonable belief was required, was selling a new drug without having obtained from the Minister a notice of compliance pursuant to reg. C.08.002(b). The definition of new drug includes the factor of not having been sold for sufficient time or in sufficient quantity to establish safety and effectiveness in Canada. Did the inspectors, or those who despatched them, know that Jamieson had not provided some of the putative information by which to assess compliance with the criteria of reg. C.08.001? "No", say the plaintiffs. But is it not probable that they knew of the letter, exhibit 1(E-28)? Mr. Ferrier denied any involvement in that matter on the part of the defendants.
"Q. Right? The decision was to declare them [the amino acid products herein] to be in new drug status?
A. The opinion that we provided was that they would be in new drug status, that's right.
. . . . .
A. Because the opinion, all that I, the authority that I have in terms of compliance actions is to provide opinions. I cannot go out and I do not have the authority to go out and seize products, or to take actions, even though I am an inspector, designated under the Act, I am not given that responsibility by my superior to go out and make, take compliance actions. So that any type of compliance action that is taken, it has to be taken by an inspector that has been delegated with those responsibilities and he must, with due consideration, take that decision on behalf of the Department.
Q. But I am referring to the decision to replace the amino acids in drug status. That's not the decision to go and seize.
A. Oh, but the decision that inspector makes is based on the fact that it is his opinion that it is a drug, a new drug and that it should not be sold, so that ...
Q. Are you now saying that the decision was taken by the inspector to place this type of isolated amino acids under drug status ...
A. The action that was taken by the inspector had to be taken by him alone, because he was the one who took this action. It is my, you know, it is my understanding that any action that is taken by an inspector, he must be quite clear in what he is doing, and if he feels that there is any doubt in what he is, action he is carrying out, that he must satisfy himself before he can take any type of, of action such as that, cause there is no kind of high official that can take that action by the inspector.
Q. Mr. Ferrier, are you saying then that no one, except the inspector, made the decision to place these amino acids under new drug status?
A. No, I am not saying that, I'm saying that the action that was taken by the inspector, had to be taken on the basis of his assessment as to the compliance of these products under the existing Act and Regulations.
Q. All right.
A. Well, he can, he could, he can obtain opinions from whoever he feels like, really, so that in this ...
Q. Well, then, Mr. Ferrier, does this mean in fact that you made no decision as to whether these amino acids were new drugs or not?
A. We made a decision on the basis of the information we had at hand that these particular products should be new drugs, insofar as we were concerned, but in terms of any subsequent compliance action that was taken, that was, we had no involvement in that whatsoever."
(August 16, 1985, p.m., pages 37 to 39)
[170]
Finally, the defendants made this admission in the Amended Joint Admissions of Facts:
"Except for the amino acids listed in [exhibit 1(E-1), (Dr. Armstrong's memo dated November 7, 1984)] the Bureau of Non-Prescription Drugs does not know why the other products listed in the Statement[s] of Claim ... were seized."
(T-2853-84, para. 52; T-2968-84, para. 43)
[171]
In the result the defendants admit that there was no reasonable belief of any violation in regard to the seized products about whose seizure they later relented and released from seizure. Insofar as the continuing seizure of the seven amino acid products listed in Dr. Armstrong's letter of November 7, 1984, there is no evidence of the inspectors' belief being reasonable or not. The mere facts that the inspectors seized them, and the defendants' asserted that they were and are new drugs (now found to be correct) does not establish the inspectors' reasonable belief that the legislation was being violated on December 17, 1984. However, an inference may be drawn from Mr. Ferrier's answers (May 10, 1985, p. 19, A. 60; Aug. 16, 1985, a.m., p. 38) that the inspectors founded their beliefs about the seven products on Dr. Armstrong's memo which is addressed to an official of the "Operations and Compliance Division". Seven, because carnitine was not then included. In conclusion, in regard to the seized products or substances which were not mentioned in that memo of November 7, 1984, included in exhibit 1(E-1), plus carnitine, the Court finds that the defendants Jamieson and Swiss Herbal suffered an unreasonable seizure.
[172]
The pivotal word in section 8 of the Charter is "unreasonable". Reasonable searches and seizures, although not per se authorized by section 8, are constitutionally valid if otherwise lawful. This begs the question in regard to the products listed in the memo, exhibit 1(E-1). Even assuming that the inspectors harboured the reasonable belief required by paragraph 22(1)(d) of the Act, does the warrant-less-seizure feature of that Act contravene the guarantee of security from unreasonable seizure enunciated in the Charter?
[173]
The leading case on this issue is  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 291; 9 C.R.R. 355; 14 C.C.C.(3d) 97; 41 C.R.(3d) 97; [1984] 6 W.W.R. 577; 33 Alta. L.R.(2d) 193; 27 B.L.R. 297; 84 D.T.C. 6467; 2 C.P.R.(3d) 1; 11 D.L.R.(4th) 641, cited for the plaintiffs. Mr. Justice Dickson (now Chief Justice), writing for the unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, stated that the Charter is a purposive document, and that the purpose of section 8 is to guarantee a reasonable expectation of privacy. This interest, however, must be assessed against the government's interest in intruding upon someone's privacy in order to advance its goals, notably law enforcement. Having stated that, Dickson, J., explained that whatever powers of search and seizure are given by law, they ought to carry with them the following three conditions:
(1) a requirement of a search warrant, or other authorization, to be obtained in advance of the search - prior authorization - in order to prevent unjustified state intrusions upon privacy from occurring. Indeed, Dickson, J., indicated at p. 161 S.C.R. that a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness arises in respect of warrantless searches or seizures.
(2) a requirement that the warrant be issued by a person who is "capable of acting judicially". This person needs not to be a judge, but must not be also involved in the investigation (i.e. must be neutral and impartial).
(3) a requirement that the issuance of a warrant be based upon an objective standard, and not merely the subjectivity of individual adjudicators. The purpose of this requirement is to provide a consistent standard for identifying the point at which the state's interests prevail over those of the individual. The mere "possibility of finding evidence" is too low a standard. Rather, "in cases like the present [anti-combines criminal investigations], reasonable and probable grounds, established upon oath, to believe that an offence has been committed and that there is evidence to be found at the place of the search, constitutes the minimum standard, consistent with section 8 of the Charter, for authorizing search and seizure". (p. 168 S.C.R.)
[174]
If a search or seizure is not authorized by statute, or if the authorizing statute does not stipulate those three conditions, then the legislation is unreasonable and is inconsistent with section 8 of the Charter. However, Dickson, J., recognized that prior authorization for a search is not always feasible, and that a warrantless search may be valid if the party seeking to uphold it can rebut the presumption of unreasonableness (p. 161 S.C.R.). The learned jurist did not need to pursue this point in Hunter, but subsequent decisions have discussed it.
[175]
With respect to statute-authorized warrantless searches and seizures, three Canadian appellate courts have drawn a distinction between the context of criminal investigations and the context of inspections or audits under a regulatory process. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.). Leave to Appeal to Supreme Court of Canada refused, [1984] 2 S.C.R. ix; 57 N.R. 238; Re Belgoma Transportation Ltd. and Director of Employment Standards (1985), 10 O.A.C. 11; 51 O.R.(2d) 509 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada refused, [1986] 2 S.C.R. v; 75 N.R. 159,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  seizure is more likely to be unreasonable when exercised in respect of obtaining contraband or evidence in the course of a criminal investigation, than when exercised by government inspectors in the course of inspections, related to public health and safety, in business activities subject to government regulation. The reason for this distinction appears to be that in government regulated business activity, there is, and must be, a lower expectation of privacy on the part of those who choose to enter it.
[176]
In Rao (regarding a criminal investigation) the Ontario Court of Appeal acknowledged this distinction in unanimously holding inoperative that portion of paragraph 10(1)(a) of the Narcotic Control Act authorizing a peace officer to conduct a warrantless search of an office, in which he or she reasonably believed illicit narcotics were located, where obtaining a warrant was not impracticable. At page 123 C.C.C., Mr. Justice Martin said that a warrantless search of an office requires justification in order to meet the constitutional standard of reasonableness. He noted that a warrantless search is justified where the circumstances make the obtaining of a warrant impracticable; but where the obtaining of a warrant would not impede effective law enforcement, a warrantless search of an office of fixed location (except as an incident of lawful arrest) cannot be justified and does not meet the constitutional standard of reasonableness prescribed by section 8 of the Charter. Martin, J.A., observed that the Law Reform Commission of Canada had recommended the creation of telewarrants for situations of emergency or inaccessibility of a justice of the peace. The recommendation has since been implemented by Parliament in section 443.1 of the Criminal Code.
[177]
In Belgoma, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a search and seizure authorized by section 45 of the provincial Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 137. Section 45 empowered an employment standards officer to enter business premises without a warrant and to require production of business records, which can be removed for copying. After noting the distinction between criminal investigations and administrative regulatory inspections, the Court found this warrantless search or seizure not to be unreasonable because it was aimed not at criminal activity, but rather at ensuring and securing compliance with the regulatory provisions of the Act for the purpose of protecting the public interest (p. 512 O.R.).
[178]
In Quesnel, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the power to effect a warrantless search, pursuant to the provincial Farm Products Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 158, the purpose of which activity was to determine the number of chickens  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's building. The Court noted that "chicken" was a regulated product, and applied Rao and Belgoma. In holding that the official was seeking to conduct only a regulatory inspection, the Court held that the legislation was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Charter.
[179]
In Bichel, the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld a municipal zoning bylaw authorizing a building inspector to enter without warrant at all reasonable times upon any property or premises to ascertain compliance with zoning Regulations. The Court stated that a warrant procedure is appropriate for searches in the course of a criminal investigation, but agreed with Rao, Belgoma and Quesnel that different considerations apply to regulatory inspections (pp. 139-140 and 143). This was explained quite thoroughly by MacFarlane, J.A., at pp. 143-144, as follows:
"The standard proposed in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  probable ground justifying intrusion. It is reasonable that such a standard be applied in a criminal investigation, or when a search is being made of the type contemplated by the
Combines Investigation Act
. That type of search involves intrusion without notice, whether it be convenient or inconvenient. It may involve a serious invasion of privacy, for instance a search through personal property. It may involve a deprivation of personal property. A police raid inevitably involves personal stigma. The search warrant procedure is needed and applies well in that type of situation.
"Different considerations apply to administrative inspections. ... An inspection involves a minimal intrusion into the privacy of a person, if conducted at a reasonable time. It does not involve a search or seizure of personal property. It involves looking at construction, wiring, plumbing and heating, and at things which may affect health or safety. There is no stigma attached to the inspection. It is something that may be reasonably expected by all members of the community, in whose interest it is to maintain health and safety standards. Once it is recognized that such inspections must proceed on a routine basis, area by area, without proof in advance of an infraction by any particular householder, then it would be an empty and futile gesture, in my opinion, to have an independent official hear the reasons a search is to be made and give a prior authorization. The fact that an infraction may be discovered, and a penalty imposed, does not persuade me that a cumbersome and ineffective procedure should be put in place. It would not protect the individual violator from being discovered. Nor is it in the public interest that he should be so protected.
. . . . .
"
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  feasible and reasonable to insist upon prior authorization.
In my opinion, it would not be reasonable to insist upon prior authorization of administrative inspections, which could only be an expensive, routine measure incapable of providing any real protection to the householder
.
"I have concluded that the bylaw is not inconsistent with s. 8 and would affirm the judgment of Mr. Justice Dohm.
"I would dismiss the appeal." (emphasis added)
[180]
In Bertram Miller, the Appeal Division of this Court upheld a warrantless seizure, pursuant to paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Plant Quarantine Act which authorized inspectors to conduct warrantless searches and seizures of any place where they reasonably believed there were pests injurious to plants. The plaintiff-respondent had imported from the United States trees and shrubs, which were found upon inspection to be infested with gypsy moth larvae. The inspectors formed the opinion that there was a reasonable danger that the whole shipment was or could soon become infested. They therefore confiscated the trees and ordered the plaintiff to destroy them. When said order was not obeyed, the inspectors themselves destroyed the trees.
[181]
In separate but concurring reasons, Messrs. Justices Hugessen and Ryan both held that this warrantless seizure was not unreasonable. Mr. Justice Heald, in dissent, did not discuss this issue; he would have dismissed the appeal on another nonconstitutional ground.
[182]
Hugessen, J., began by noting that in a section 8 review, regard must be had not only to the text of the statutory provision, but also to the context of the provision. That is, he explained, it is necessary to examine the purpose of the statutory scheme authorizing the search or seizure, the nature of the property seized, the character of the premises where the search or seizure may normally be expected to occur, and the legitimate interests of both the public at large and the person subjected to the search or seizure. Hugessen, J., elaborated on this at p. 341 F.C. as follows:
"What is reasonable in terms of entry into and inspection of a restaurant kitchen or a commercial dairy, or a factory, or a mine will differ radiocally from what is reasonable for the search and seizure of private papers in a dwelling house. By the same token, there is a distinction between a statutory scheme which obviously envisages routine inspections and testing at reasonable times in the normal course of business and one which is designed to permit, where necessary, armed and forceable intrusion at three o'clock in the morning. In short, there is a difference in kind between the tramp of jackboots and the sniff of the inspector of drains.
"In my view, there is clearly a category of public health-and safety-related inspections carried out in commercial or industrial premises where a warrantless search and seizure is not only reasonable but essential for the protection of the public good."
[183]
After noting that the Ontario Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Belgoma drew this same distinction, Hugessen, J., applied his reasoning to the legislation and facts at hand, as follows (p. 343):
"The evident purpose of the Plant Quarantine Act is the protection of our forests and our farms from infestation from parasites.
. . . . .
"Once as a result of the search plant material is found to be infested and to constitute a hazard, the public interest in its seizure and destruction forthwith must surely outweigh any interest whose protection is envisaged by section 8 of the Charter.
"All these things being considered, it is my view that the quoted provisions of the statute do not authorize an unreasonable search and seizure."
[184]
Ryan, J., also approved the distinction made by Martin, J.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and stated that "it would be undesirable to introduce into our administrative law system a relatively inflexible warrant requirement". (p. 134). This seizure, Ryan, J., said, was merely a step in an administrative process and had nothing to do with criminal law.
[185]
Ryan, J., explained that section 8 protects at least two interests, a person's reasonable expectation of privacy, and a person's interest in being secure against unreasonable seizure of his or her property, but found the opposing interests to be predominent in this case. First, there was a powerful public interest in safeguarding New Brunswick forests against potentially-damaging infestations. Second, there was an "emergency situation". In addition, the Act's standard that the inspectors have reasonable belief that the plants are hazardous was, in Mr. Justice Ryan's opinion, a reasonable standard. The inspectors did in fact have reasonable grounds for their belief that a danger of infestation existed. As a result, Ryan, J., concluded, a warrant or other prior authorization from an impartial arbiter was not a necessary precondition. The ratio of this Bertram A. Miller decision centres on the emergency created by an immediate hazard of infestation.
[186]
The cases just discussed yield the following guidelines for evaluating the impact of section 8 upon a statute-authorized warrantless search or seizure:
- Warrantless searches or seizures in the course of a criminal investigation are more likely to be held unreasonable than warrantless searches or seizures in the course of an administrative inspection process.
- Generally where obtaining a warrant is impracticable, the courts are more likely to uphold a warrantless search or seizure.
- Factors of impracticability include the degree to which effective law enforcement may be impeded, the degree to which an emergency exists, and the importance of the public interest (e.g. protection of health and safety).
- The less the intrusion upon the individual's privacy, the more likely the warrantless search or seizure will be upheld (e.g. if it takes place at a convenient time, if there is no stigma attached, if it does not involve a search or seizure of personal property, etc.).
[187]
Applying these to the case at bar, it is apparent, on balance, that the defendants' seizure of the plaintiffs' stock violated section 8 of the Charter.
[188]
The search and seizure authorized by section 22 of the Food and Drugs Act does not meet the Hunter test because section 22 does not stipulate any of the three conditions, stated therein supra. As a result, a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness, and thus invalidity, arises.
[189]
This presumption has not been rebutted. First, the defendants cannot rely upon the less strict test of reasonableness which the courts are applying in the context of administrative inspections because this search and seizure was in the context of a criminal investigation. The plaintiffs' point is well taken: the defendant can hardly argue on the one hand that the legislation is intra vires of Parliament in regard to criminal law, and on the other hand argue that the searches and seizures are conducted, not in the course of a criminal investigation, but rather in the course of regulating the manufacture, sale and labelling drugs in Canada. (Transcript 3, pp. 147 to 158). The new drug Regulations are assimilated largely to criminal law prohibiting the sale of new drugs for which no notice of compliance has been issued. Paragraph 26(b) of the Act provides that breach of the Regulations is an offence which is prosecuted on indictment. Upon learning of the plaintiff's continuing intentions to ignore this prohibition, but to ascertain its rights and obligations in action T-2853-84, commenced on December 6, 1984, the defendants thereafter conducted the seizure of the contraband and evidence. That evinces more characteristics of a criminal investigation than of an administrative process of inspection or regulation.
[190]
It is true that paragraphs 22(a), (b) and (c) create powers which appear to provide for regulatory inspections, but paragraph 22(d) which the inspectors invoked, provides that such official "may ... seize and detain ... any article by means of or in relation to which he reasonably believes
any provision of this Act or the Regulations has been violated
". Those are the words in which section 26 is expressed. The legislative intent to make paragraph 22(d) an enforcement adjunct to the prosecution of offences pursuant to section 26 is too clear to merit further discussion.
[191]
Moreover, obtaining a warrant for a seizure pursuant to paragraph 22(d) of the Act is not necessarily unfeasible or impracticable, especially not in situations such as the case at bar, which appears to involve a typical invocation of the power to seize. Here, no emergency can be said to have existed, as indicated by the protracted lapse of time between the defendant's determination that the plaintiff's products were 'new drugs' and the actual seizure. And, effective law enforcement would not have been impeded by the defendant's obtaining prior authorization for the search and seizure. The plethora of letters which passed between the two parties in this particular instance indicates that the plaintiff was not at all secretive; indeed the plaintiff was acting with the utmost candor. Thus, the lapse of, at most, one more day to obtain prior authorization would not have been likely to result in the plaintiff's selling or concealing or destroying its 'new drugs'. In the circumstances, the fact that it was not an office from which the articles were seized is of minor import.
[192]
Parliament itself, as distinct from the defendants whom it charges to administer the law, appears to be in potential accord with the above observations. By subsequently enacting subsections 22(1.1), (1.2) and (1.3) of the Act, Parliament exacts that a warrant shall indeed be obtained, on ex parte application to a justice of the peace, where an inspector seeks to enter a "dwelling-house" and to search for and seize any article therein. By having enacted section 443.1 of the Criminal Code, Parliament has provided that in the investigation of indictable offences if it "be impracticable to appear personally before a justice ... for a warrant" a peace officer (but not an inspector under the Act, unless the latter be also the former) may apply for a telewarrant. Thus the defendants' contentions on this score are, at least potentially, foreclosed both ways. Those recent enactments surely provide a potent criterion against which the alleged necessity of warrantless seizures under paragraph 22(d) is found wanting in contemplation of section 8 of the Charter, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  authorization for seizing anyone's property resides in fairness to that person. The process of obtaining a warrant, or telewarrant, creates a record, the enforcer's sworn information, by means of which the person may, on good grounds, if any, apply to have the warrant quashed in appropriate circumstances. Because Canadian jurisprudence has taken the path of according the Charter's essentially human rights to corporate artificial "persons", the recourse is open equally to individuals, and to corporations such as the plaintiffs.
[194]
If this case be regarded as being on the borderline between regulatory inspections and criminal investigations, a contention which the Court rejects, it is therefore on the cutting-edge of the articulation of rights guaranteed by the Charter. The defendants could hardly invoke section 1 thereof in this regard. So, if there were any doubt here, the preferable course is to accord the benefit of it to the plaintiffs and to cleave to the purposive constitutional imperative of guaranteed rights.
[195]
Clearly, then, prior authorization was feasible. Prior authorization would not have caused an imbalance in favour of the plaintiff's expectation of privacy and security of property over the State's valid objectives of law enforcement and safeguarding public safety. Therefore, the warrantless seizure was unreasonable, and in contravention of the Charter, section 8. To that extent, paragraph 22(1)(d) of the Food and Drugs Act is declared to be, and to have been, of no force or effect.
[196]
The seizure is quashed as being unlawful. The seizure only is declared unconstitutional. The provisions of paragraphs 22(1)(a), (b) and (c) provide for the kind of administrative or regulatory search or inspection which, according to the jurisprudence above cited, carries no constitutional requirement of prior authorization so long as it be not conducted in, or in relation to, a dwelling-house or private office. A general office, or vault or any place were the books, documents or records mentioned in paragraph 22(1)(c) can be found also escapes the requirement of prior authorization, for the searching for, and inspecting of, those items on business premises is an administrative or regulatory search or inspection. Jamieson's articles are to be returned to it, and Swiss Herbal's articles are to be released from their "voluntary seizure". This is, to a large extent, a moral victory only for the plaintiffs, for their products which are, or contain, the eight listed amino acids remain firmly subjected to the entirely valid new drug Regulations. Their moral victory, however, relieves them of any obligation to pay the defendants' costs of these proceedings. The defendants' confusion and disarray in dealing with the plaintiffs, as well as the defendants' conduct after the institution of these actions gives them no justifiable claim for costs against the plaintiffs.
SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
[197]
Jamieson's action T-2853-84 is dismissed without costs for or against any party. The Food and Drugs Act's impugned DIN Regulations C.01.014 to C.01.014.4 inclusive are intra vires of Parliament. The manner in which they were applied to the plaintiff, although inept, was not unfair, unreasonable nor discriminatory, nor did it create any flagrant injustice. The plaintiff Jamieson is not entitled to receive a DIN for the product "Stress Ease with Vitamins and Minerals" with L-trypto-phan as an ingredient, since such a product would be a new drug pursuant to regulation C.08.001.
[198]
The three plaintiffs' action T-2968-84 is disposed as follows: the plaintiffs' prayers for declarations expressed in paragraphs a), b), d) and the alternative prayer for relief, in their reamended statement of claim filed on December 16, 1986, are dismissed; subparagraph 25(1)(o)(ii) of the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations C.08.001 to C.08.011 are intra vires of Parliament and those Regulations are intra vires of the Governor General in Council. The eight isolated amino acids, and the amino acid products comprehended in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim, but specified in paragraph 22 of the statement of defence, are "new drugs" within the meaning of the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations thereunder. The manner in which they were applied to the plaintiffs, although inept, was not unfair, unreasonable nor discriminatory, nor did it create any flagrant injustice; and the plaintiffs' prayer for a declaration expressed in paragraph c) of their said statement of claim is granted in these terms:
"... the seizure of articles conducted on December 17, 1984, by the defendant Director, and the inspectors, officials and any other public servants who were then members of his staff or otherwise authorized to effect such seizures, was and is illegal null and void, in particular, in that said seizure was unreasonable and contravened section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."
[199]
There will be a consequent order that the defendants, their inspectors, officials and subordinate staff shall return to the plaintiff Jamieson all the articles seized on and from its premises on December 17, 1984, unless there be some extraneous lawful reason for not so doing, and they shall release from "voluntary seizure" all of Swiss Herbal's articles so held on and from December 17, 1984, unless there be some extraneous lawful reason for not so doing.
[200]
The parties' having achieved mixed success in action T-2968-84, the defendants, shall pay to the plaintiffs, and the latter are awarded, seventy percent (70%) of the said plaintiffs' party-and-party costs of and incidental to this action, after taxation, or, as the parties may agree, should the defendants elect to waive taxation of costs. All three plaintiffs having engaged the same firm of lawyers in this action (and Jamieson's other solitary action), full counsel fees shall be calculated and taxed as for two primary counsel, (i.e. double counsel fee) but only once, and not times-three, of which one calculation, 70% as noted above, is included in the costs to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs.
[201]
Judgments will be separately formulated and entered respectively in each action, and a copy of these reasons for judgment shall be lodged in both files.
Order accordingly.
