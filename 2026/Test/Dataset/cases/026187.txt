Reed, J.
: The defendant seeks an order striking the plaintiff's statement of claim because it discloses no reasonable cause of action. The statement of claim seeks to require compliance by the Province of Prince Edward Island with the
Canada Health Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-6. This action arises out of the plaintiff's refusal to have her children issued a social insurance number ("SIN") for the purposes of provincial health care administration. She asserts that there is no federal legislation mandating the use of a SIN for that purpose. She objects to its use for unauthorized purposes. As a consequence she is required to pay for health care services provided to her children. The extent to which she is eventually reimbursed is unclear on the basis of the record. For the purposes of a motion to strike, pursuant to rule 419(1)(a), I am required to accept the allegation in the statement of claim as being true. The relevant allegations state:
"(b) ... the Hospital and Health Services Commission denied payment of any claims for health care rendered to the plaintiff's daughter because the plaintiff's daughter did not have a Social Insurance Number. ...
"(c) Subsequently, the plaintiff forwarded copies of invoices received to the Commission and requested them to reimburse her payments made to health care providers in order to obtain medical care for her daughter.
"By letter dated April 26th, 1991 the Commission refused to comply with our request for reimbursement.
. . . . .
"(i) ... Although certain expenses have been reimbursed to the plaintiff by the Commission, there are a number of outstanding invoices which the plaintiff has paid but not been reimbursed."
[2]
Sections 9, 10 and 12(1) of the
Canada Health Act
set out criteria and conditions which must be met before full payment may be made to a province under the
Act
:
"9. In order to satisfy the criterion respecting comprehensiveness, the health care insurance plan of a province must insure all insured health services provided by hospitals, medical practitioners or dentists, and where the law of the province so permits, similar or additional services rendered by other health care practitioners.
"10. In order to satisfy the criterion respecting universality, the health care insurance plan of a province
must entitle one hundred per cent of the insured persons of the province to the insured health services
provided for by the plan on uniform terms and conditions.
. . . . .
"12(1) In order to satisfy the criterion respecting accessibility, the health care insurance plan of a province
(a) must provide for insured health services
on uniform terms and conditions and on a basis that does not impede or preclude, either directly or indirectly
whether by charges made to insured persons
or otherwise, reasonable access to those services
by insured persons;
(b) must provide for payment for insured health services in accordance with a tariff or system of payment authorized by the law of the province;
(c) must provide for reasonable compensation for all insured health services rendered by medical practitioners or dentists; and
(d) must provide for the payment of amounts to hospitals, including hospitals owned or operated by Canada, in respect of the costs of insured health services."
[3]
Sections 14 to 17 provide for the procedures which are to be followed if a provincial plan does not meet or fulfil the criteria and conditions. Sections 14 and 15 provide:
"14(1) Subject to subsection (3), where the Minister, after consultation in accordance with subsection (2) with the minister responsible for health care in a province is of the opinion that
(a) the health care insurance plan of the province does not or has ceased to satisfy any one of the criteria described in ss. 8 to 12, or
. . . . .
and the province has not given an undertaking satisfactory to the Minister to remedy the default within a period that the Minister considers reasonable, the Minister shall refer the matter to the Governor-in-Council.
"(2) Before referring a matter to the
Governor-in-Council
under subsection (1) in respect of a province, the Minister shall
(a) send by registered mail to the minister responsible for health care in the province a notice of concern with respect to any problem foreseen;
(b) seek any additional information available from the province with respect to the problem through bilateral discussions, and make a report to the province within ninety days after sending the notice of concern; and
(c) if requested by the province, meet within a reasonable period of time to discuss the report.
"(3) The Minister may act without consultation under subsection (1) if the Minister is of the opinion that a sufficient time has expired after reasonable efforts to achieve consultation and that consultation will not be achieved.
"15(1) Where, on the referral of a matter under s. 14, the Governor-in-Council is of the opinion that the health care insurance plan of a province does not or has ceased to satisfy any one of the criteria described in ss. 8 to 12 or that a province has failed to comply with any condition set out in s. 13, the Governor-in-Council may, by order,
(a) direct that any cash contribution or amount payable to that province for a fiscal year be reduced, in respect of each default, by an amount that the Governor-in-Council considers to be appropriate, having regard to the gravity of the default; or
(b) where the Governor-in-Council considers it appropriate, direct that the whole of any cash contribution or amount payable to that province for a fiscal year be withheld.
"(2) The Governor-in-Council may, by order, repeal or amend any order made under subsection (1) where the Governor-in-Council is of the opinion that the repeal or amendment is warranted in the circumstances."
[4]
The plaintiff asserts that requests have been made to the Minister to pursue the default proceedings in ss. 14 to 17 of the
Act
but he has refused to do so.
[5]
The plaintiff claims four remedies in paragraph (x) of her statement of claim:
"1. A Declaration that payments made by the Minister of Finance to the Province of Prince Edward Island with respect to the
Canada Health Act
are illegal so long as the
Health Services Payment Act
authorizes the Denial of Health Care to children who do not have Social Insurance Numbers.
"2. An injunction to prohibit the Minister of Finance from making payments to the Province of Prince Edward Island until the
Health Services Payment Act
is amended.
"3. A Declaration that the health services plan of the Province of Prince Edward Island fails to comply with the universality, accessibility, and comprehensiveness conditions as set out in the
Canada Health Act
.
"4. A Declaration that ss. 10(4) and 11 of the
Health Services Payment Act
[R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. H-2] and ss. 12, 13, 23(a) and (m) of its regulations are inconsistent with ss. 6, 7, and 15(1) of the
Charter of Rights
and of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the
Charter
."
[6]
While the plaintiff's underlying complaint lies against the Province of Prince Edward Island, part of the statement of claim which has been filed in this court bears a striking resemblance to the proceedings in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . These decisions dealt with a plaintiff's attempt to have the government of Manitoba comply with the provisions of the
Canada Assistance Plan
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-1, insofar as the level of welfare payments to him was concerned. The first of the above cited decisions dealt with issues of standing and whether a justiciable issue existed. The second dealt with the merits of the plaintiff's claim.
[7]
While I initially was of the view that no justiciable issue was raised by the plaintiff's statement of claim, on rereading the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decisions (supra) and assuming, as I must, that all the allegations in the statement of claim are true, I conclude that a justiciable issue exists and that the claim is within the jurisdiction of this court.
[8]
I have wondered about one aspect of the statement of claim, which was not the subject of argument before me: whether the Minister of Finance pays the amounts in question. I am not convinced that he does. It appears to me, on reading the relevant legislation, that it is the Minister of Health and Welfare who makes such payments after the Minister of Finance has allocated the amount payable. See
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health Contribution Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-8, Part V, ss. 13(2)(b), 19(1), 22, 23 and 25. At the same time, since this was not the subject of argument before me, I do not propose to strike out the relevant provisions of the statement of claim on that basis. If this is a defect, it is one which can easily be cured by an amendment to the pleadings.
[9]
It was argued that the second remedy, listed above, an injunction to prevent the relevant Minister paying full compensation to the province, is not available because injunctions are not available against the Crown. The decision of Mr. Justice MacKay in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  was cited in support of this proposition. In that case an injunction was sought against the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
[10]
While it has long been a principle at common law that an injunction could not be issued against the Crown, a body of jurisprudence has grown up that injunctions can issue against servants or agents of the Crown when they are acting outside the scope of their statutory authority. Indeed, not to allow such to happen has been criticized as bad public policy. Insofar as the federal Crown is concerned, this was effected by the rules of common law. Recently, however, s. 22 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 was amended by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 28 and it now reads:
"(1) Where in proceedings against the Crown any relief is sought that might, in proceedings between persons, be granted by way of injunction or specific performance,
a court shall not, as against the Crown, grant an injunction
or make an order for specific performance, but in lieu thereof may make an order declaratory of the rights of the parties.
"(2) A court
shall not in any proceedings grant relief or make an order against a servant of the Crown that it is not competent to grant or make against the Crown.
" (underlining added)
[11]
I have pondered over what was intended by that addition to the legislation. It seems clear that it only applies to proceedings against the Crown brought under s. 17 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 by way of statement of claim. Insofar as judicial review proceedings are concerned (which are not proceedings against the Crown). Section 18(1) of the
Federal Court Act
specifically gives the Trial Division jurisdiction to grant an injunction against a "federal board, commission or other tribunal". And, a federal board, commission or other tribunal is defined by s. 2(1) to mean "... any person ... exercising or purporting to exercise ... powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament ...". Indeed if injunctions were not available in this context it is hard to know how orders of mandamus could ever be justified. An application for judicial review can now, in an appropriate case, be converted into an action (S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 5). Thus had the plaintiff been able to frame her action as one for judicial review, rather than a proceeding against the Crown by way of statement of claim, an injunction would clearly have been available. I note as well that Mr. Justice MacKay's decision did not find that an injunction did not lie against a Minister, as distinct from the Crown itself, but that in that particular case there was no evidence that the Minister was acting outside his statutory duties.
[12]
My puzzlement about the intended scope of s. 22(2) is increased when I read the committee discussion in the House of Commons on Bill C-38 (House of Commons: Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Legislative Committee on Bill C-38, January 30, 1990, 8:18 - 8:29). Committee members were given the impression that no change in the law was being made by the amendment but that it was merely a codification of a constitutional principle of the existing common law. No suggestion was made, for example, that the legislation was intended to overrule decisions such as
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and the Supreme Court and Federal Court decisions in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> litigation. In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> litigation the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff had "standing to seek the injunctive relief prayed for in his statement of claim" ([1986] 2 S.C.R. at 635) but whether such relief should be granted was a matter for the discretion of the trial judge. When the case came before the Supreme Court on the merits, Madame Justice McLachlin approved Mr. Justice MacGuigan's decision in the Court of Appeal ([1993] 1 S.C.R. at 1120), where he held that the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case was not an appropriate one in which an injunction should be granted since the "consequences would ... be totally out of proportion to the mischief sought to be remedied by the respondent. Moreover declarations are invariably honoured by governments and I see no necessity for other relief". The reason of both the Federal Court of Appeal and Madame Justice McLachlin was based on the understanding that an injunction in an appropriate case, could have issued against the Minister of Finance.
[13]
I therefore have asked myself whether s. 22(2) was intended to overrule this jurisprudence as opposed to codifying the existing law. In my view, the wording of the section leads to the latter conclusion. The provision states that injunctions shall not be issued against Crown servants when the court is not competent to grant an injunction against the Crown. The injunctions under the common law which are granted against Crown servants, when they act outside their statutory authority, are based on the individual being responsible for the actions taken and are not based on the court being competent to issue an injunction against the Crown, see: P.W. Hogg,
Liability of the Crown
(1989) at pp. 23-28. Also, I am reluctant to conclude that the intention of the new subsection was to overturn decisions such as those set out above when this was not the position taken by the responsible Minister before the House of Commons or by the government officials who appeared as witnesses before the legislative committee which studied Bill C-38. On reading the proceedings before that committee, it is clear that none of the Members of the House of Commons, who were considering the prospective legislation, thought that a change in the law was being made.
[14]
In addition to the jurisprudence which has established that injunctions may be issued against servants of the Crown, when they act outside their statutory authority, because they are personally responsible for those actions, there is also jurisprudence which indicates that a distinction must be made between a Minister who is acting as a servant of the Crown and a Minister who is acting as a servant of the legislature; see P. Lordon,
Crown Law
(1991) at pp. 179-180. I do not find it necessary to pursue that analysis in this case because I do not think I need to do so having come to the decision I have reached on the wording of s. 22(2).
[15]
With respect to the fourth remedy sought in paragraph (x) of the plaintiff's statement of claim, it is argued that the paragraph seeks relief primarily and solely against a nonparty. That subparagraph seeks a declaration that certain provisions of the Prince Edward Island legislation is contrary to the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. The provisions allow a physician who is not provided by a patient with a SIN number to charge the patient directly and authorizes nonpayment by the Commission of those amounts to the patient. I have not been convinced that the validity of the provincial legislation is linked to the remedies which are sought against the federal Crown or the remedies sought against the named Minister. It is an independent and separate claim. The plaintiff has combined two separate causes of action, one against the federal government alleging illegal payment to the province is not complying with the federal legislative requirements and the other against the provincial government alleging that the manner in which its health care system is administered is contrary to the
Charter
. As I indicated orally, in my view, the correct defendant with respect to the latter claim is the Government of Prince Edward Island and it is more properly sued in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island.
[16]
The plaintiff argues that while the Government of Prince Edward Island has not been named as a defendant it has been served and invited to participate as an intervenor. It has chosen not to do so. As I have indicated, I have been persuaded that the relief sought in the fourth subparagraph of paragraph (x) is solely relief against a nonparty and therefore that subparagraph should be struck out.
[17]
An order will issue in accordance with these reasons and the defendant's request for alternative relief, an extension of time to file a statement of defence, will be granted.
Application allowed in part.
