Dubé, J.
: The plaintiff ("Cartier") is a US company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with its head office in New York, U.S.A. This action is for an infringement of the rights associated with its trademark "CARTIER", arising from its registration as No. 146,848 dated September 2, 1966 resulting from the use of the name "LUNETTES CARTIER" by the defendant. The defendant ("Lunettes Cartier") is a Canadian company with its head office in Calgary, Alberta and a business office in Montréal, Québec.
[2]
The plaintiff's trademark is for use in association with, inter alia, articles of jewellery for personal wear, watches, wallets, billfolds, key cases, card cases, briefcases, photograph cases, combs and comb cases, precious metal wares including eyeglass cases.
[3]
The plaintiff's predecessor, the House of Cartier, was founded in Paris in 1847 by Louis-François Cartier and became world-famous as jewellers for kings of France and England.
[4]
Cartier is best described by Hans Nadelhoffer in his book Cartier, Jewelers Extraordinary, published in New York, NY, in 1984: "For more than a century the name Cartier has been synonymous with luxurious and imaginative jewels. Top-quality gems, distinctive designs, and exquisite workmanship have made Cartier the favorite of kings, queens, tsars, maharajahs, and an international array of millionaires".
[5]
An American office was established in New York in 1909 and carried on business continuously under the name Cartier, Incorporated. The plaintiff and its predecessor through their advertising and publicity in American publications circulated in Canada since 1923, have made their trademark and trade name well known in Canada in association with articles of jewellery.
[6]
The defendant ("Lunettes Cartier") was incorporated in 1977 and subsequently commenced to use the word Cartier as a trade name in association with the sale of eyeglass frames. The defendant also sells eyeglass frames of plated metal bearing the inscription "Lunettes Cartier" on the inner side of the temple portion of the frames.
[7]
The plaintiff alleges that the defendant infringes its right under s. 20 of the Trade Marks Act as an owner of a registered trademark to its exclusive use. Cartier, therefore, seeks an injunction, a declaration that the defendant's use causes confusion, and damages.
[8]
The evidence at the trial has clearly established that many famous names in the world of fashion, such as Christian Dior, Pierre Cardin, Calvin Klein, Polo-Ralph Lauren, etc., have in recent years entered into the eyeglass market. Glasses have become a fashion accessory which has captured the attention of designers and hauts couturiers. The plaintiff also joined the new fashion wave and invaded the Canadian market in the eighties. The defendant Lunettes Cartier was already selling heavily across Canada and competing as well against the fashion designers.
[9]
In a 1981 decision,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I upheld the Registrar of Trade Marks' decision denying the application of the plaintiff, a haberdasher, for the mark "CARTIER" for use in association with articles of jewellery and leather goods, on the grounds that cuff links, tie clips and wallets are in the same general class as jewellery and leather goods and that there was the likelihood of confusion. Under s. 6(2) there can be confusion, even between different wares, if the use of the same trademark in the same area is likely to lead to the inference that the wares associated with the trademark are sold by the same person, whether or not such wares are of the same general class.
[10]
Section 6(5) of the Act provides five criteria for determining whether trademarks are confusing. The subsection reads as follows:
"6(5) In determining whether trade marks or trade names are confusing, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trade marks or trade names have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them."
[11]
I shall therefore apply each criterion in turn to the facts of the instant case.
(a) The inherent distinctiveness
[12]
Distinctiveness will take into account the originality of the trademark. Essentially, the more distinctive and original the trademark, the stronger the protection it will receive from the court.
[13]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Cattanach, J., formerly of this court, was dealing with only one trademark, "BONUS", and in those circumstances had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that if inherent distinctiveness were the only factor "it points to one manufacturer or vender" (at page 184). He found the trademark "BONUS" to be distinctive.
[14]
In an American decision,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court held that "there is no question but that plaintiffs' trademark ("CARTIER") is a strong mark entitled to protection". The following paragraph bears reproduction (at page 128):
"... Plaintiffs' mark is strong, and over the years their mark has been associated with high quality products, more or less targeted for an exclusive clientele. Cartier is about to enter the cosmetic field in which the defendant is operating by marketing a perfume. The name Cattier is strikingly similar to plaintiffs' prestigious mark, Cartier. While there has been no evidence of actual confusion, the likelihood of confusion is all that is required ... Defendant's products are inexpensive, and continued use of the mark Cattier or Pierre Cattier creates a likely source of confusion with plaintiffs' mark and gives the consuming public the impression that Cartier is now the source of inexpensive rather than high priced and high quality merchandise, thereby diluting plaintiffs' mark."
[15]
However, in my own decision (Cartier Men's Shops Ltd.) already referred to, I agreed with the Registrar that the trademark "CARTIER" possessed little inherent distinctiveness in view of the surname's significance in this country, going back to Jacques Cartier, the discoverer of Canada in 1534. Of course, the inherent distinctiveness of a mark can be considerably enhanced through publicity.
[16]
Where an inference of common origin of the wares could arise, the criterion of distinctiveness will be defeated. Hence, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the plaintiff company carried on business throughout the world in the sale of tobacco products and a wide range of luxury goods. Their entire business had been conducted under the name and trademark "DUNHILL". In recent years they had diversified and moved from tobacco to luxury goods for men. One Christopher Dunhill, the son of the Chairman of Dunhill, conceived the idea of using the name Dunhill, together with his Christian name Christopher, for the purpose of marketing spectacle frames and sunglasses. The court pointed out that, at that juncture, certain other well known firms had also entered into that market, including Christian Dior, Yves St-Laurent, etc. The plaintiff Dunhill charged that Christopher Dunhill was deliberately attempting to cash in on the Dunhill reputation by creating confusion. The trial judge had emphasized the fact that Dunhill was not in the spectacle frames and sunglasses market. Roskill, L.J.C.A., said as follows (at page 362):
"... With very great respect to the learned judge, the judgment does not seem to deal with the point that it was alleged damage to the overall Dunhill reputation which was in issue and not damage to particular classes of goods which Dunhill's were presently involved in selling."
[17]
The learned judge came to the conclusion that in the business world Dunhill's reputation extended "very far beyond their original activities in the tobacco and smoking industry" (at page 362).
[18]
A trademark may lose its distinctiveness if its use by different commercial entities becomes widespread. The defendant filed a list of 60 registered trademarks under the name Cartier. However, almost half of them (29 by my count) are registered by the plaintiff Cartier. I cannot conclude from the evidence before me that the "CARTIER" trademark has become so widespread as to lose its distinctiveness. And, as we shall see later, the plaintiff Cartier has taken legal steps to protect its trademark wherever it felt that confusion may arise.
(b) The length of time the trademarks have been in use
[19]
As mentioned earlier, the name Cartier has been known in France for the past 140 years. In Canada, a 1921 article in the Montreal daily La Presse calls the public's attention to the name Cartier. There is conclusive evidence that the Cartier name in association with jewellery and other expensive luxury goods has been known in Canada long before the defendant came into operation in 1977. The latter only started to advertise in a substantial way in the 1983-1984 period so as to meet the new competition from the designers who had entered the eyeglass market.
(c) The nature of the wares
[20]
As mentioned earlier, eyeglasses have now become fashion accessories. The defendant Lunettes Cartier sells to opticians and optometrists, whereas the plaintiff Cartier sells its luxury items mostly in fashion boutiques. However, so as to establish the likelihood of confusion, it is not necessary to prove that the wares are sold in the same places, provided they are of the same general class, could eventually be sold in the same places, and the parties are entitled to do so ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[21]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant sought to register the trademark "CARTIER" for use in association with fluorescent lamps. The hearing officer held (at page 131) that the use of the trademark by another party in "the same area would be likely to lead to the inference, in the minds of customers, that the wares associated with such trademarks were all manufactured or sold by the opponent".
[22]
In the instant case, the evidence reveals that the Cartier luxury wares which were created in the last century for monarchs and the opulent elite were gradually scaled down to meet the demands of a different society. Ralph Destino, chairman of the board of Cartier, described today's Cartier customer as a newly affluent, upwardly mobile, married person, 35 to 45 years old, responsive to status symbols and interested in style, quality and taste.
[23]
On the other hand, Lunettes Cartier has upscaled its publicity so as to maintain its strong market position as a leading distributor of eyeglasses in Canada against the arrival of more sophisticated competitors.
[24]
Thus, the wares sold by both parties are now within the same range of luxury eyeglass frames and are appealing to the same clientele, although the plaintiff Cartier carries a more expensive line.
(d) The nature of the trade
[25]
Again, the plaintiff is registered for eyeglass cases, but it claims that eyeglass frames are an extension of its luxury line of goods. On the other hand, the defendant Lunettes Cartier submits that it does not sell eyeglass cases: it gives them away with the frames. It is indeed the custom of the trade to provide eyeglass cases free along with eyeglasses. Clearly, the sale price is set to include both items. The plaintiff's wares are sold through boutiques and some fashion conscious department stores, while the defendant sells to opticians and optometrists through salesmen. Interested customers may seek and find the desired eyeglass frames at any of those outlets.
(e) The degree of resemblance between the trademarks
[26]
The two marks are identical: "CARTIER". The addition of the word "Lunettes" to "Cartier" does not really dispel the confusion. Fox wrote as follows in The Canadian Law of Trade Marks and Unfair Competition (3rd Ed. 1972), (at page 392):
"... No amount of added matter intended to show the true origin of the goods can affect the question, ... Indeed, as indicated in a number of cases, the very fact that additions are made to a trade mark by a defendant only serves to show that the defendant knew he was sailing close to the wind ..."
[27]
At discovery, the President of the defendant company admitted that there was confusion in the minds of the customers. At page 118 he was asked the following question and gave the following answer:
"Q- The confusion that you referred to, is that your opinion from the fact that there are two (2) 'Cartier' names out there?
Q- (Vous avez parlé d'une confusion. Est-ce que c'est votre opinion à vous çà, qu'il y a confusion étant donné qu'il y a deux (2) noms 'Cartier'?)
R- Bien, je pense qu'il y a confusion. Pour moi, oui. Puis, si ça continue comme çà, ça va l'être pour les clients aussi.
A- (As far as I am concerned, there is confusion. I believe that there is confusion. But it could go further. If it continues, there will be confusion in the consumer's mind.)"
[28]
Moreover, in an action by the defendant Lunettes Cartier against Essilor Canada Limitée, a distributor of eyeglass frames and sun glasses bearing the mark "CARTIER" and acting for the plaintiff Cartier, Lunettes Cartier alleged that "confusion was created in the minds of the consumers".
[29]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  SLAM" for facial and body creams and other similar products. The opponent relied upon a registration of the mark "GRAND SLAM" for men's shirts and sweaters. The application was refused and the hearing officer took judicial notice that the toiletries covered by the two parties are both part of the fashion industry. An average member of the public would likely think that clothing and toiletries bearing the same designer mark emanate from the same source as it is not uncommon for stores to sell both men's clothing and at least some specialty toiletries in fairly close proximity.
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the plaintiff enjoyed an extensive reputation with the name "Red Label" for whisky. The defendants were about to launch a new brand of cigarette under the name "Red Label". The High Court of Justice refused the plaintiff's application for an injunction. However, Brightman, J., said as follows (at page 360):
"To put the matter in general terms, if one trader acquires a reputation with the public in relation to a particular name or get-up, the use of that name or get-up by another trader in either an associated field or even in a different field may be restrained if the public may be confused into thinking that the product or service of the other trader has the cachet of the first trader's established name or get-up. This is to be distinguished from what may be called product confusion. In the case with which I am concerned there is obviously no possibility whatever of product confusion. No one would purchase the defendants' Red Label cigarettes thinking that he was buying the plaintiffs' Red Label whisky. The confusion, if any, is only that of name."
[31]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the companies involved were not engaged in similar businesses but still Macfarlane, J., of the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted the plaintiff a declaration that the defendant has no right to use the word  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He held that it is not necessary for the plaintiff to establish an overlap of business activity. It may succeed by establishing a confusion of businesses: persons coming across the defendant's name are likely to conclude that the plaintiff and the defendant are connected. He quoted, with approval, Fox in The Canadian Law of Trade Marks and Unfair Competition (3rd Ed. 1972), at pages 562-563 as follows (at page 217):
"'Confusion may thus arise in more than one way. There may be confusion of goods, in which case the defendant's goods are purchased as and for those of the plaintiff. In the second place there may be confusion of businesses ... The aggrieved party may have lost no actual sales because, perhaps, he does not sell goods of the type bought by the purchaser, but if those goods are of an inferior quality, the owner of the business that is wrongly regarded as the source of the goods, will suffer considerable damage. Competition is not, therefore, an essential factor before damage can be proved, and for this reason s. 7(b) of the Trade Marks Act refers to "the business of another" rather than to "the business of a competitor".'"
[32]
In the instant case the plaintiff Cartier has clearly established that throughout the years the Cartier people have taken steps to protect what they consider to be their most precious asset, the name "Cartier" as a house of high reputation. They sought relief whenever they felt that the name "Cartier" could be debased. There are many businesses in Canada bearing the name Cartier, ranging from apartment buildings to construction companies. The plaintiff has not gone after them all, but merely after those which are involved in fields of business where Cartier though confusion was likely to arise with injury to the reputation of Cartier.
[33]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Ontario Court of Appeal noted (at page 182) "the broad approach now taken by courts to the issue of confusion" and referred to Ritchie, J., of the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , who said that the issue is whether the "marks are likely to suggest the idea that the wares or services with which they are associated are produced or marketed by the same person".
[34]
The plaintiff Cartier had a survey made in 1987 by The Creative Research Group Limited, a company specializing in market research, one of the largest in Canada. The President and Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Marilyn E. Sandler testified in court in support of the survey. The mandate given by the plaintiff to the research firm was "to design, implement and report on a research study to determine consumer perceptions associated with Lunettes Cartier as used in association with eyeglass frames". Separate surveys were carried out in the Toronto and Montreal areas. The research study was based upon two Lunettes Cartier advertisements which appeared respectively in the Toronto Life Fashion Magazine (Spring edition of 1987) and in Clin D'Oeil Magazine (November, 1986).
[35]
Both advertisements show the face of an attractive woman wearing a pair of sophisticated glasses. Both carry the name "Lunettes Cartier Optical" and the words "Face Création Cazal". Personal, door-to-door interviews were conducted in the English language in Metropolitan Toronto and in the French language in Montreal, 304 interviews in Toronto and 309 in Montreal. Qualified respondents were defined as persons aged 25 years or more who currently own sunglasses or prescription eyeglasses, 50% male and 50% female. In Toronto the minimum 1986 household income requirement for qualified respondents was $25,000.00 and $20,000.00 in Montreal. These income restrictions were put in place to include the segment of the population most likely to be representative of the readership of the two magazines. The research study established ten conclusions. The more relevant is to the effect that 62% of the respondents who had an opinion as to the company that manufactures the products shown in the advertisement named "Cartier" and less than 2% named "Lunettes Cartier". Another conclusion was that the word "Lunettes" had little or no significance in terms of identifying the mannufacturing company.
[36]
Counsel for the defendant ably and forcefully attacked the validity of the survey on various grounds. Nevertheless, I accept the survey as having been scientifically and impartially conducted. Even counsel admitted that the expert witness, Marilyn E. Sandler, the President of the firm was qualified as an expert in that field. And the defendant did not produce an expert of its own to rebut the survey, or to advance an opinion of his own that confusion was unlikely in the circumstances.
[37]
As to the admissibility of such surveys as evidence of confusion in intellectual and industrial property actions, the jurisprudence has clearly ruled in the affirmative,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  criteria have been identified as essential to the validity of such surveys. In my view, those criteria have been met in the survey in question and I have no problem in accepting the general conclusion that there is confusion in the minds of respondents in Montreal and Toronto with reference to the name of the company that manufactures the eyeglass frames marketed by the defendant Lunettes Cartier.
[38]
The defendant, for its part, alleged that the plaintiff's certificate of registration for the trademark "CARTIER" makes no mention of frames for prescription glasses or sunglasses. It submitted that the plaintiff therefore had no exclusive right to use of the mark "CARTIER" in association with frames or sunglasses.
[39]
First, the defendant referred to a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  s. 19 of the Trade Marks Act gives an owner the exclusive right to use his trademark for the wares for which it has been registered. It referred also to Canadian Council of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  also stated that s. 19 gives an owner an exclusive right only with respect to the wares and services included in the registration. It should, however, be remembered that under the provisions of s. 20 of the Act, an owner of a registered trademark has a right to its exclusive use and that right is deemed to have been infringed by a person who sells other wares in association with that mark, thus creating confusion.
[40]
The defendant submitted that the plaintiff's evidence is based on similarities, in the sense that eyeglass frames are an extension of the items mentioned in the registration. In such circumstances, it submitted, other manufacturers are entitled to the same market.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for example, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the burden of proof in a trademark infringement case is to establish a reasonable probability of confusion, while in an application to register the plaintiff must establish that there is no reasonable possibility of confusion. It is on this basis that the plaintiff Cartier succeeded in its objection to the registration of the mark "CARTIER" by Cartier Men's Shops Ltd.
[41]
It is true that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in an infringement proceeding and that it must show a reasonable probability of confusion. In my opinion, this is exactly what the plaintiff has shown in this case.
[42]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Cattanach, J., said that the proper criterion is the likelihood that a person of normal intelligence acting with ordinary care would be confused, and that a judge must assess the attitude and normal reaction of such persons. In the case at bar, I have concluded that such a person would be confused by the marks "CARTIER" or "LUNETTES CARTIER" in association with the defendant's frames: such a person might be led to think that the frames in question are those of the plaintiff Cartier.
[43]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Cattanach, J., in 1984 had to compare two wares for which two trademarks had been registered, both showing in a slightly different form a horse drawing a carriage. He concluded that the respondent's wares were low-cost and sold in ski, tennis and golf shops, while the appellant's wares were sold in costly and exclusive stores. Though some duplication might exist between the wares, they were not sold side by side in the same stores. The learned judge accordingly dismissed the objection. It should, however, be remembered that in the case at bar there are not two slightly different designs, but a single trademark, the mark "CARTIER".
[44]
The defendant further alleged that the chronology of events works in its favour. The history of the French company Cartier is that of a major jeweller, not an eyeglass manufacturer. The defendant was already established in the eyeglass market in Canada in 1977. In 1980 it received a notice from the plaintiff Cartier. It was not until 1982 that the plaintiff Cartier put eyeglass frames or sunglasses on sale and it knew at the time that the field was already occupied by the defendant. The plaintiff did not finally bring proceedings in the Federal Court against the defendant until August 1983, and it did not enter the Canadian eyeglass market until 1984. According to the defendant, this late entry and these court proceedings represent nothing less than an expropriation.
[45]
The response of the plaintiff Cartier is that the notice was served as soon as the defendant's existence was brought to its attention. The proceedings in the Federal Court were delayed because the two parties tried to reach agreement. A first draft of an agreement was in fact prepared by the plaintiff, but the defendant waited several months before finally refusing to sign the document.
[46]
The defendant further alleged that under s. 7(b) of the Act, the plaintiff must establish the likelihood of confusion created by the defendant at the time the latter began drawing public attention to its wares by using the name "Lunettes Cartier", and hence at the time the defendant first began operations. So far as determining the possibility of confusion between the two trademarks is concerned, under s. 20, the defendant submitted that the relevant time for consideration is the time when such a possibility of confusion could have first existed, or a time reasonably close to the beginning of the defendant's operations in 1977. It submitted that the mere passage of time cannot be a means of improving the plaintiff's situation and enabling it later to establish a likelihood of confusion by a poll conducted in 1987.
[47]
In my opinion, even if no confusion or possibility of confusion existed when the defendant Lunettes Cartier began its operations in 1977 (which has not been proven), the evidence was that the defendant subsequently, in or about 1983 and 1984, followed the new trend created by the leading designers Pierre Cardin, Christian Dior, Yves Robichaud and so on, who themselves expanded the range of their luxury products to invade the eyeglass market. Thus, the defendant itself, through its own publicity, entered the more sophisticated market thereby creating greater possibilities of confusion.
[48]
The evidence in general, and in particular the survey carried out by The Creative Research Limited, showed that there was confusion in 1987 when the poll was conducted. That period is valid in the case at bar since s. 20, on which this action is based, is worded in the present tense. Additionally, the rule under s. 6(5)(b) for determining confusion covers the length of time the trademarks or trade names have been in use and is not limited to any particular period. In Bonus Food, cited above, for example, the court applied the rule in question to a twenty-year period, from the beginning of the commercial operations to the time of the trial.
[49]
For all these reasons, the court will grant an injunction restraining the defendant from selling eyeglass wares in association with Cartier, Lunettes Cartier, Lunettes Cartier Ltée, Cartier Optical Ltd. or any other word or words that constitute a colourable imitation of the plaintiff's trademark "CARTIER", provided this injunction shall not apply to any bona fide use other than as a trademark of the defendant's corporate name Lunettes Cartier Ltée written in letters of the same size and not in any script form, catalogues and other publicity documents intended to be used for customers, and provided further that this injunction shall not apply to any goods which the defendant now has on hand, which are now in transit or which are now in the process of being manufactured.
[50]
In its statement of claim the plaintiff also prayed for damages or an accounting of the defendant's profit, as the plaintiff elects. The plaintiff, however, did not apply under rule 480, ten days before the trial, for an order to proceed to trial without adducing evidence as to damages but referring damages flowing from the infringement to be assessed after trial. Moreover, no evidence was adduced during the trial to show what damages the plaintiff may have sustained in consequence of the infringement of its trademark. In the course of the arguments, the plaintiff's counsel suggested that an amount equal to 6% of the defendant's total sales of eyeglass frames and parts marked with the trademark "LUNETTES CARTIER" from January 1, 1984 to date would be fair compensation for any damages sustained by the plaintiff.
[51]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this court found that there was a failure to prove damages at trial and, in view of the absence of a request for a reference ten days before trial under rule 480, refused to grant damages.
[52]
In Brouwer Turf Equipment Limited and Brouwer v. A and M Sod Supply Limited and Van de Maele, [1977] F.C. 51; 13 N.R. 83, the Federal Court of Appeal dealt with the appeal of an order of the trial judge dismissing an application for an order of reference under rule 480 on damages in a patent infringement action. The court dismissed the appeal. The court said that the real purpose of leaving the rule 480 class of matter to a reference is to minimize the expense of an action, that it was a matter of discretion for the trial judge and that his decision was not to be set aside except for a manifest error.
[53]
In the case at bar, since the defendant was in business of selling eyeglass frames in Canada some seven years before the plaintiff, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assess what damage the defendant may have inflicted on the plaintiff's trademark. And, again, there was no attempt by the plaintiff to prove any such damage. In any event, the defendant will have been penalized enough as a result of this injunction, including the costs of this action, without adding further injury. Thus, no damages will be awarded to the plaintiff.
Judgment for plaintiff in part.
