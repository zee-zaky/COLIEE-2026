Muldoon, J.
: The appellant appeals from the decision of the citizenship judge rendered on August 16, 1990 in which the latter wrote:
"Pursuant to s. 14(3) of the
Citizenship Act
, you are hereby formally notified of my decision not to approve your application for Canadian citizenship.
"My reason is that you have not complied with s. 5(1)(e) of the
Citizenship Act
which requires an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship.
"You did not demonstrate an adequate knowledge or understanding of Canada, its political system and its system of government nor of your rights and privileges as a Canadian citizen.
"I have considered and decided against recommending to the Minister an exercise of discretion on compassionate grounds under either of ss. 5(3)(a) or 5(4) of the
Act
, as I found no facts or circumstances which could give rise to the exercise of this discretion.
"You now have two (2) courses of action which you may take:
1. You may file a new application for citizenship now or at any time when you feel you can comply with the requirements of the
Citizenship Act
.
2. You may exercise your right to appeal this decision to the Federal Court, Trial Division.
. . . . .
"If you decide simply to make a new application, you should, with the help of a Citizenship training class, the study material supplied at the time of application and the daily reading of a newspaper, soon be able to improve your knowledge sufficiently to meet the requirements of the
Act
."
[2]
The appellant's notice of appeal, in which it is indicated that she will be represented by Mac Harb, M.P., sets out the grounds of her appeal, thus:
"During the question period [i.e., before the citizenship judge], Mrs. Khouri was anxious and, as a result, her inability to hear increased. She was not asked any of the questions she was told to study from and she demonstrates all the qualities of a good Canadian citizen."
In effect, the appellant appeared to demonstrate a great need of help from her husband and her son (who acted as her interpreter at the hearing) who are both citizens of Canada.
[3]
The appellant appears to be in a state of profound dependence upon one, if not both of above mentioned persons, and far short of the state of autonomy to which Canadian women are entitled, in equality with Canadian men. She is illiterate in regard to her own language, Arabic, as she also is, in regard to Canada's two official languages. She is virtually unable to speak English or French and so, the appellant fails to meet the criterion of s. 5(1)(d) of the
Act
. She has no adequate, almost no, knowledge of Canada's history, geography or current events. Obviously she would have to acquire knowledge of history, current events and civics orally from her family. A big map of Canada is really a picture and she could learn the location of provinces and cities from it. In these regards, she really could derive great benefit from those who are near and dear to her.
[4]
It is alleged that the appellant's hearing diminishes inversely according to the state of her "anxiety". There is an illegible photocopy of a handwritten note from a "Dr. Jerry Pelka" on this file, but the appellant's representative has not provided the court with the original document or with a legible photocopy, so that note, whatever it is, must be simply disregarded. Really, the appellant's lack of hearing is not the problem here. It is her lack of adequate knowledge.
[5]
The appellant's representative made two principal arguments in favour of allowing this appeal.
[6]
In the first place he alleged that the citizenship judge did not consider the fact of the appellant's illiteracy. That is not apparent in the citizenship judge's decision. In any event, as stated by Mr. Justice Walsh of this court in
Re Swarn K. Bhatti
, T-6188-81, April 23, 1982, cited by the appellant's representative:
"The law does not require a person to be literate to be a citizen, and in view of her inability to read and in the absence of information classes given in her own language it is difficult to see how the necessary knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship can be acquired."
[7]
Parliament solemnly enacted the language criterion in s. 5(1)(d), above mentioned; and in s. 5(1)(e), it legislated to the effect that an eligible applicant "has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship". The residence requirement in s. 5(1)(c) is designed to ensure that the applicant has time to mingle with many Canadians, in various places and activities. An
Act
of Parliament is not to be treated lightly, and especially in view of the fact that Parliament did not also enact anything saying "Ah well, if the appellant is a good person let her have her citizenship even if she cannot speak either official language and she demonstrates a profound ignorance of Canada and the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship." The court, above all, must treat a solemn
Act
of Parliament with all the respect due to the law, and the rule of law. Citizenship is precious and not to be lightly conferred in disregard of the law. Of course it would be no derogation from the law to accord citizenship to an illiterate applicant who nevertheless could comply with the criteria enacted in s. 5(1) of the
Citizenship Act
.
[8]
The applicant's representative's second principal argument was that despite the citizenship judge's declining to recommend to the Minister an exercise of discretion (in the applicant's favour) under s. 5(3) or (4), this court on appeal could nevertheless make such a recommendation pursuant to s. 15 of the
Act
in disregard of the citizenship judge's decision. This interpretation is incorrect according to what Parliament has enacted.
[9]
Regard for the structure and sequence of provisions which Parliament enacted in ss. 14 and 15 reveal Parliament's dealing in s. 14 with the citizenship judge's powers of decision and also the Federal Court's jurisdiction on appeal therefrom. It is only after those provisions in s. 14 are expressed that Parliament, in s. 15, returns to the citizenship judge and exacts the latter's consideration of whether or not to recommend an exercise of discretion under ss. 5(3) and (4). No authority, initial or appellate, is conferred on the Federal Court in this regard.
[10]
This exact point was considered in 1978 by Mr. Justice Addy of this court in the case of
Re Akins
(1978), 87 D.L.R.(3d) 93, where he concluded (page 96) after having performed an analysis of the structure and sequence of the
Act's
pertinent provisions:
"For the reasons previously stated, I find that I have no jurisdiction to make any recommendation that executive action be taken pursuant to s. 5(4). I come to this decision somewhat reluctantly for, after hearing the eloquent representations made by the appellant personally, the latter having acted on his own behalf, and having regard to his statements as to the nature and the alleged results of his work in the Sharel region of West Africa, in connection with a C.I.D.A. approved project, it is conceivable that I might have considered the advisability of making a recommendation on the basis of services rendered which were of exceptional value to Canada. I must point out, however, that the appellant stated to me that he had never presented these facts to the Citizenship Court Judge at the time of the original hearing.
"The appeal is therefore dismissed."
[11]
The above judgment was followed by Mr. Justice Strayer in
Re Mrs. Khen Khat
, T-2883-90, on September 23, 1991. Citing with favour
Re Akins
(above),
Re Boutros
, [1980] 1 F.C. 624, and
Re Aaron
, [1982] 2 F.C. 348, Strayer, J., wrote as follows:
"Her representative strongly urged that I should make a recommendation to the Minister to exercise his discretion under s. 5(3)(a) of the
Act
to waive the requirement of such knowledge in s. 5(1)(e) on compassionate grounds. The compassionate ground pressed was that Mrs. Khat cannot acquire a better knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship because she is illiterate in Cambodian as well as in both official languages of Canada. She has made serious efforts to learn English since coming to Canada but has made only moderate progress. This is her second unsuccessful application for citizenship.
"There has been some division of opinion in this court concerning the jurisdiction of the court to make such recommendations. I respectfully agree with those judges who have found that the court has no such jurisdiction. The appeal to this court which is authorized under s. 14(1)(5) is an appeal 'from the decision of the citizenship judge under subs. (2) ...', and the decision referred to in that subsection is a decision of the judge to approve or not approve the application. The power given to a citizenship judge in s. 15(1) with respect to the exercise of discretion on compassionate grounds is that of making a recommendation to the Minister in this respect. This is not a 'decision' under s. 14(2).
"Section 14(2) provides, however, that as a precondition to making a decision under that section, the citizenship judge must consider whether or not to make a recommendation under s. 15(1). While it is not for this court, sitting on appeal, to review the conclusion of the citizenship judge as to whether a recommendation should be made, in a proper case it may be open to this court to refer the matter back to the citizenship judge if this court is not satisfied that relevant factors have been taken into account in the exercise of that discretion."
[12]
One cannot find such specific jurisdiction to refer the matter back, as indicated, in the
Citizenship Act
, but it might well be accomplished upon a concurrent application under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
for an order in the nature of mandamus.
[13]
In the case at bar, however, it can be seen (with some difficulty of legibility) that the citizenship judge did indeed consider the question of whether to make a recommendation under s. 15(1) of the
Citizenship Act
. As her file discloses, she wrote in the notice to the minister the following passage which is incomplete in the poor photocopy of her file presented to this court:
"Lors de l'entrevue à mon bureau, j'ai constaté que cette personne n'avait pas une connaissance suffisante du Canada, des privilèges et responsabilités tel que requis à l'alinéa 5(1)(e) de la
Loi
.
"Me référant au paragraph 15(1) de la
Loi sur la citoyenneté
je n'ai rien décelé justifiant une recommandation de l'exercice des pouvoirs discrétionnaires prévus aux paragraphes 5(3) et 5(4) de la
Loi
.
"Vous trouverez ci-joint le répertoire des questions posées et la cote des réponses ainsi que mes commentaires.
"Considérant l'âge de la requérante, soit 51 ans, considérant qu'elle est au Canada depuis 13 ans, selon moi elle n'a pas mis beaucoup d'efforts à étudier la documentation en sa possession. La requérante n'a démontré aucune difficulté à comprendre les questions posées par le judge et l'interpr ..."
[14]
(Parenthetically it should be noted and exacted that rule 903 requires transmission of the citizenship judge's complete file - not just a copy of it, and especially not an illegible copy.)
[15]
The present appeal proceedings were conducted in English and the appellant's son served as the interpreter. That type of service should, if possible, be avoided since it puts the interpreter into a conflict of interest. Even so, however, the appellant evinced considerable difficulty in answering questions, to some of which (although she seemed to hear) she remained silent.
[16]
So, while, one might not like the citizenship judge's reasons for declining to recommend any exercise of the Minister's discretion, there is nothing which anyone is authorized to do about it. The reasons (so much of them which the court can read) would hardly support an application for mandamus in these circumstances.
[17]
Applicants are entitled by law to appeal from the citizenship judge's decision, but they are also entitled just to go ahead and make a new application for citizenship before the same or another citizenship judge. One gets the impression that the appeal avenue is over-used as if, somehow, a successful appeal would restore the applicant's honour or reputation. By that standard an unsuccessful appeal would be a disaster. Honour or reputation, however, are simply not at risk here or before the citizenship judge. The appeal should serve and be invoked only to take a fresh view of an application which has been harshly or arbitrarily rejected - certainly not the case here. It may be that sometimes the citizenship judge would express the hope that an appeal be taken, if only to have a "second opinion" on some difficult point. Appeals should, then, be rare, and new applications should be the norm.
[18]
This appeal, unfortunately should be, and it is, dismissed. Perhaps the appellant will succeed on a new, future application for citizenship with the help of her husband and children, as she well deserves.
Appeal dismissed.
