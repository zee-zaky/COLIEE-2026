Richard, J.
: This is an application under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as am., for judicial review of a reconsideration pursuant to s. 12(1) of the
Veterans' Appeal Board Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1.2 (the
Act
) of a decision of the Veterans' Appeal Board of Canada (the Board) dated January 26, 1995. This tribunal was reconsidering its decision of August 1, 1990 which confirmed the decision of an Entitlement Board dated December 4, 1989. The Entitlement Board had ruled in part that the applicant's dorsal disc disease was not attributable to Active Force service.
[2]
The applicant (Service No. V-57633 (Canadian Navy) R.C.N.V.R.) entered Active Service on April 14, 1943, served during World War II, and was discharged on November 12, 1945. While in the Service, he was stationed aboard the H.M.S. Thane (C.V.E.) aircraft carrier where he served as a first class Stoker (engine room).
[3]
In December of 1943, the then 21 year-old applicant was carrying a 25 lb can in each hand from the upper deck to the engine room below. As he passed through a bulkhead, the door mechanism let go and the arm which was supposed to hold the door secure crashed into his back, knocking him to the deck. His shipmates helped him up and sent him to sick bay where he was given two aspirins and the rest of the day off. He was told by the sick bay attendants at that time that if he continued to experience back pains, he would be sent to a hospital for X-rays. The next day, he was assigned lighter work as active watch keeper's duty and the pain receded over the next few days.
[4]
The H.M.S. Thane went down just over a year later and medical records of this incident seem to have been lost. Nevertheless, the respondent does not dispute that the above incident occurred.
[5]
On his discharge medical examination on November 12, 1943, the applicant admits that he did not mention the accident. His only complaint referred to a deviated septum; an injury which is not in issue in this application. No X-rays were taken of his back. With age, the applicant claims the back pain from the bulkhead incident returned.
[6]
There are no medical reports of back problems until 1973. Since that time, numerous medical reports have been filed demonstrating a disc narrowing in the applicant's spinal column, probably as a result of healed compression fractures. These reports also refer to some disc degeneration.
[7]
On December 2, 1987, the applicant first claimed that his deviated nasal septum and dorsal disc disease were attributable to his Active Service and thus pensionable under s. 21(1) of the
Pension Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-6, as am. By decision dated August 30, 1989, the Canada Pension Commission concluded on the issue of the back complaint as follows:
"A review of the veteran's service documents indicates that at enlistment, on 26 May 1943, the veteran was seen to be fit and accepted for service in the Navy.
"It is the veteran's contention that the claimed condition results from his being struck in the back by an iron door on board one of the ships on which he served. Unfortunately, there is no record of any such back injury during service, nor at discharge medical examination on 19 September 1945.
"During the post-discharge period the file is silent with regards to the claimed condition until 1978 when x-ray examination indicated narrowing of the discs at D9, D10 and D11 as well as some osteophytic formation.
"On the medical information available, the claimed condition must be seen to be late post-discharge in origin and unrelated to Active Force service. With regret, the claim is denied."
[8]
The applicant appealed to the Entitlement Board pursuant to s. 88 of the
Pensions Act
. In a decision dated December 4, 1989, the Entitlement Board decided on the question of the back complaint as follows:
"The advocate told the Board that the disability could be attributable to an injury sustained in late 1943 or early 1944, which unfortunately is not recorded. Then she pointed out that the diagnosis found at page 6 of the statement of case, in a report by Dr. R. Bertrand dated 28 August 1978, referred to a 'diminution de hauteur des corps vertébraux de D9, D10 et D11 ... très légère scoliose à convexité droite'.
"Another report dated 14 September 1978 from Dr. R. Breitman, accepted as Exhibit S-1, revealed a decrease in the length of dorsal vertebrae T9, T10 and T11 with pains dating back to 1973.
"Then the applicant testified that while in service on an aircraft carrier, in the engine room as a stoker, when carrying a 5 gallon can of grease to the engine room through the bulk heads, he was hit by an unhooked door; he went to sick bay and laid down for the rest of the day. They gave him an aspirin and the next day, it was a little less sore, but he could not carry cans for a while. When he got over (sic), the pain got more severe. After the war, he worked as a taxi and/or bus driver, but he had to quit bus driving because the seats were too hard. When he was driving cabs, his back was sore, but he though that it was because of the long hours on his cab. He never had any other accident except the one mentioned above.
"The Board, although it believes the applicant when he testified that he had an accident which was not reported during his service in high seas, cannot conclude favourably because there is no objective evidence between the said accident and 1973 and, moreover, objective evidence in 1973 does not relate the disability to Active Force service. Therefore, the Board cannot find a relationship between the disability and the Active Force service. Subjective evidence only with such lack of objective continuity makes it impossible for the Board to conclude favourably."
[9]
The applicant appealed from the Entitlement Board to the Veterans' Appeal Board. In a decision dated July 30, 1990, the Board confirmed the above decision of the Entitlement Board.
[10]
On September 26, 1994, the Area Advocate acting for Mr. Silver wrote to the Board requesting a reconsideration of the first decision in light of new evidence. The new evidence in question consists of three affidavits.
[11]
The first two consist of attestations by Mr. Silver's two elderly aunts, Mrs. Anne L. Campbell and Mme. Laurette Deschamps Lapointe. These two attest to having been in close contact with the applicant shortly after his discharge from Active Service. They attest that he complained about pain in his back immediately after discharge, but refused repeatedly to see a doctor since he was convinced the pain would go away.
[12]
The third piece of new evidence is the affidavit of M. Gérald Deschatelets dated August 5, 1994. M. Deschatelets was one of the shipmates who assisted Mr. Silver in reaching sick bay after his accident. This letter attests to having witnessed the accident as it had been described by the applicant.
[13]
In the letter of September 26, 1994, it was submitted to the Board that they should reconsider their initial decision since this new evidence provided a record of the accident, as well as evidence of ongoing complaint of disability in the post-discharge period.
[14]
On the basis of the letter requesting a reconsideration, and without inviting submissions from the applicant, the Board rendered its decision on January 26, 1995, which concludes as follows:
"The Board is unable to conclude that the new evidence overcomes the total absence of any mention of a back injury or back problems in service or at discharge from service in November, 1945, nor the silent medical record for 33 years into the post-discharge period.
"The Board notes that the Applicant recorded complaints of 'sinus trouble' in a Confidential Report dated November 5, 1945, but there is no mention of a back problem in this report nor in the Medical Examination for discharge dated September 19, 1945, when the Applicant signed a certificate stating that 'I do not claim to suffer from any disability due to or aggravated by service.'
"While the Board does not doubt the Applicant's claim to have been hit in the back by a bulkhead door in 1943, based on the medical record, it is unable to relate the claimed condition to that incident."
[15]
Section 12(1) of the
Act
, under which the decision under review was rendered, reads as follows:
"12(1) Notwithstanding subsection 9(3), the Board may, on application or on its own motion, reconsider and confirm, rescind or amend a decision of the Board, including a decision under this section, or substitute a new decision therefor, if new evidence is presented to it or if the Board determines that it erred with respect to the finding of any fact or the interpretation of any law in reaching the decision.
"(2) Section 10 applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, with respect to an application under subsection (1) as if it were an appeal to the Board."
[16]
Section 10 governs the procedure by which the Board must conduct the hearing. The relevant subsection reads as follows:
"10(2) Any person who appeals to the Board shall be afforded full opportunity to appear before the Board and to present documentary evidence and argument to it, in person or by a representative and at the person's own expense ..."
[17]
On the evidence before me, it is clear that the appellant was not given the opportunity to appear before the Board [see footnote 1]. There is no indication in the letter sent by the appellant's representative on September 26, 1994 requesting reconsideration, that the appellant wished to have the case disposed of without the necessity of personal appearance.
[18]
For these reasons, I find that the Board's reconsideration and rehearing, conducted in the appellant's absence and without advising him of his right to make oral submissions, denied the appellant the procedural protection of s. 10(2) and was therefore made in excess of jurisdiction. The application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Veterans' Appeal Board dated January 26, 1995 is quashed and the matter is returned to a differently constituted Board.
[19]
I note that it is incumbent on the Board to give clear reasons demonstrating a rational connection between the statutory provisions, the evidence presented and the conclusion reached. It is not sufficient merely to mention the evidence put forth by the appellant and to state that the
Act
requires that every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant be drawn from it [see footnote 2]. The Board must either draw those inferences or give clear reasons why it does not find them to be reasonable.
Application allowed.
