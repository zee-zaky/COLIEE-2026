Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application for an order setting aside the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated September 24, 1992, which held the applicant is not a Convention refugee. At the conclusion of the hearing of this matter on April 19, 1994, I dismissed the application indicating these written reasons would follow.
[2]
Counsel for the applicant attacked the decision on the grounds the board erred in law when it determined that many aspects of the applicant's evidence were implausible and by ignoring or misconstruing much of the evidence before it.
[3]
The impugned decision is based on a lack of credibility. The Refugee Division did not believe the applicant's testimony concerning his involvement with the dissident Ghanian soldiers from Togo. Its reasons indicate the panel clearly and unequivocally determined Mr. Boye not to be a credible witness, and detailed reasons for that conclusion are contained in the decision. Indeed, the reasons cite a number of implausibilities in the applicant's evidence concerning integral aspects of his refugee claim.
[4]
The jurisprudence has established the standard of review in cases of this nature. To begin with, questions of credibility and weight of evidence are within the jurisdiction of the Refugee Division as the trier of facts in respect of Convention refugee claims. When a tribunal's impugned finding relates to the credibility of a witness, the court will be reluctant to interfere with that finding, given the tribunal's opportunity and ability to assess the witness, his demeanour, frankness, readiness to answer, coherence and consistency in oral testimony before it. As stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and weight are matters particularly within the Board's jurisdiction to decide."
[5]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  opinion, the points argued by counsel for the applicant raise only questions of credibility and of the weight of evidence and afford no legal basis upon which this court could properly interfere with the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board."
[6]
Furthermore, the Refugee Division is entitled to make an adverse finding of credibility based on the implausibility of an applicant's story, provided the inferences drawn can be reasonably said to exist. Negative findings with respect to an individual's credibility are properly made, provided the tribunal gives reasons for its decision in clear and unequivocal terms.
[7]
After having carefully examined the reasons of the Refugee Division in the present case, I am satisfied it considered and weighed all of the evidence adduced by the applicant, and determined for the numerous and detailed reasons given, that Mr. Boye had not assisted the dissident soldiers in Togo by passing on strategic information. I am unable to conclude the panel ignored the evidence before it or that its findings were perverse or capricious. In the absence of such an overriding error, there is simply no basis for judicial interference with the decision.
[8]
For these reasons the application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
