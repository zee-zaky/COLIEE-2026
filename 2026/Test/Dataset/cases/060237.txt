Rouleau, J.
: The plaintiffs, the owners and persons interested in the cargo, seek to recover for rust damage sustained by two shipments of steel destined for Hamilton, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan and which were loaded aboard the "Federal Danube" at Antwerp, Belgium, November 14-16, 1984. The first shipment is a cargo of 15 coils of cold rolled steel, covered by Bills of Lading 3 and 4 and stowed on board in Hold No. 5; the second is a cargo of 36 coils of zincrometal steel sheets, covered by Bills of Lading 130 and 132, and stowed in Hold No. 1 of the vessel. These actions were joined by the Senior Prothonotary Jacques Lefebvre by an order dated June 5, 1989.
[2]
The "Federal Danube" set sail from Antwerp on November 17, 1984, reaching the Gulf of St. Lawrence November 24, 1984. It travelled the St. Lawrence River upstream but on November 27, due to the closure of the Valleyfield Bridge in the St. Lawrence Seaway system, it was required to remain at anchor below the City of Montreal until December 10, 1984. As a result, the cargo of cold rolled steel did not reach the port of Hamilton, Ontario, until December 16, 1984; rust damage was not discovered until January 16, 1985, at which time two of the coils were "de-canned" or removed from their protective wrappings at the consignee's premises. A portion of a third coil was later found to be damaged by rust; the remainder of the shipment was however useable.
[3]
The zincrometal cargo was discharged in Detroit, Michigan on December 19-20, 1984, and stored dockside. It was transported by truck between January 11 and 15 of 1985 to Namasco Inc., the purchaser. A few days later, at the consignee's place of business, three coils were de-canned and found to be affected by rust and were therefore not useable for automobile bodies, their intended purpose. A full survey of the cargo was conducted on behalf of the plaintiffs, February 15 and March 29, 1985, and it was confirmed that rust had affected the entire shipment.
[4]
The plaintiffs submit that the rust damage sustained by both cargoes was as a result of the negligence of the carrier in stowing and caring for the cargo during the voyage. More particularly, they argue that the defendants negligently loaded and discharged the cargo during rain; stowed allegedly hygroscopic ferro manganese alongside the zincrometal coils; covered the steel with plastic sheeting during the voyage, trapping the moisture and eventually causing rust; and finally, failed to properly ventilate the holds in which the cargo was stowed. All of these factors, they submit, contributed to condensation or "cargo sweat", resulting in rust damage.
[5]
The defendants counter that the plaintiffs have failed to discharge the onus of proof resting upon them in that they have not proven the cargo was tendered for delivery in good condition or subsequently discharged damaged; nor that the damage sustained was connected to negligent acts of the carrier. The defendants state further that if rust did come about because of their negligence, it occurred outside the period of their responsibility; and, if it occurred at all, was due to factors over which they had no control and for which they are exempt from liability under the provisions of the Hague Rules.
[6]
In a secondary submission, the defendants argue that if they are responsible for the damage which occurred, their liability is limited under the U.S. Carriage of Goods by Sea Act ("COGSA") to $500 per package. The plaintiff on the other hand is of the view that the Hague-Visby Rules ought to apply, as adopted by Belgium; the port of loading and the place where the bills of lading issued.
[7]
It should be noted that in this proceeding a Rogatory Commission was appointed to take evidence from several witnesses in both Belgium and the U.S. From time to time I shall be referring to this testimony in the course of my reasons.
[8]
The cargoes were produced in France by Sollac, a specialty steel manufacturer; their sales agent was Daval and Satem their forwarding agent. The zincrometal sheets were produced at a plant in Florange, then transported to a facility in Onaing where the zinc coating was applied. From Onaing it was transported by special rail car to a barge staging area at Illange, stored indoors for two weeks and subsequently moved by barge along the Rhine River to the port of Antwerp, where it was stored for approximately three weeks in a covered but open warehouse, approximately 30 meters from the water's edge. The precise date of manufacture of these sheets is unclear; however, the evidence disclosed that the original order for these coils had been cancelled, and the shipment stored for some weeks until resale had been arranged. I estimate the manufacturing date at some time in August 1984. The cold rolled steel cargo, on the other hand, went directly from the manufacturer by rail car to the port of Antwerp, to the same open shed, arriving on November 5. Both shipments were loaded on board the "Federal Danube" between November 14 and 16 of 1984.
[9]
The steel coils had been packed in moisture-proof paper and then wrapped in metal "envelopes", secured by steel bands. The evidence indicated that the method of packing was considered to be "average"; not completely water-tight, since water could run down the outer packing, collect in the flange and be drawn into the coil where moisture could eventually cause rust. However, there was no convincing evidence that better packaging was generally available or ought to have been used.
[10]
Mr. Lucien Deschang, employed as a shipper for Sollac, gave evidence with respect to the usual procedural steps and safeguards applicable to the steel as it proceeds through the various plants in France. He emphasized quality-control which was in place at the mills; he dealt as well with transportation and storage between France and Antwerp. I am satisfied that the steel was adequately protected at all stages of production and that the quality-control measures in place were effective. Although a witness for the defendants, Mr. Sparks, questioned the vulnerability of the shipment of the zincrometal between the place of manufacture and the plant where the zinc coating was applied, from the evidence of Mr. Deschang I am satisfied that sufficient precautions were taken and I have not been persuaded that any damage would have occurred during this stage.
[11]
Just prior to and during loading, the cargo was inspected on behalf of the defendants by Mr. Hans Caers between November 14 and 16, 1984. This inspection was confined to the external packaging only and specifically was restricted to exterior physical damage or rust. Mr. Caers stated that if he suspected any damage to contents, the shippers would have been notified; they, in turn, would have the coils unwrapped ("de-canned") in order to examine the contents. There is no indication that this occurred. All problems noted by Mr. Caers during his inspection would then be transcribed on the mate's receipt and the bills of lading and the shippers would be informed. It should be noted that de-canning the coils, or decoiling in order to examine for rust, is a very expensive procedure; it requires that the coils be transported to a mill where proper machinery is available to perform the task.
[12]
A subsequent report prepared for the owners with respect to the zincrometal shipment confirmed that Mr. Caers noted on both the mate's receipt and the bill of lading that "envelopes partly rust-stained where not coated or scratched". This apparently referred to scratches on the red paint of the envelopes and to unpainted patches where the exposed metal envelopes had rusted. On the bills of lading for the cold rolled steel cargo, the unpainted but galvanized metal envelopes were, he noted "partly white oxidated". These remarks reveal some contact with moisture; however, from the evidence, I have concluded that these were "minor" comments which concerned packaging only. The remarks were not indicative of the condition of the contents.
[13]
There is also a notation in Mr. Caers' pre-loading survey and the mate's receipt that a separate cargo of steel plates, stowed in Hold No. 1 along with the zincrometal coils, was wet before loading.
[14]
On board and before departure, the shipment was further inspected by Julien DeKeyser on behalf of Satem, the plaintiff's forwarding agent. He testified that he would have exercised more precaution only if he found unusual remarks on the mate's receipt; that the notations made by Mr. Caers were not considered to be a problem, since they appeared to affect only the envelopes, not the contents. Mr. DeKeyser restricted his inspection to the hatches and reported no defects; he did not enter the holds for further inspection but noted that he saw no water from his cursory inspection. It was also his evidence that it was Satem's policy not to allow rusted or otherwise damaged goods to be shipped; nor to permit the loading of coils during rain, and that hatches would be ordered closed if this occurred. He confirmed his inability to inspect the contents and viewed only the exterior envelopes.
[15]
Following the loading of the zincrometal cargo in Hold No. 1, it was covered with a plastic sheeting to protect it from dust since a bulk cargo of ferro-manganese was stowed alongside the coils in the centre of the hold. There is some indication that there may have been a very light drizzle during this latter operation; nevertheless the coils would have been protected from direct contact by both the deck overhang and the plastic sheeting. The Log Book confirms that there was no loading performed at Antwerp during periods of rain and that the hatches would have been closed. This assertion, taken from the vessel's log, was not contradicted, leading to the conclusion that no loading operation was being conducted during inclement weather.
[16]
The "Federal Danube" was equipped with "natural" ventilation. The hatches, whose sides extend above the deck, were fitted with "flaps" which could be opened to allow air to flow in the holds under proper conditions. The evidence reveals that this ventilation method is well-known in the trade and acceptable equipment for ships transporting this type of cargo; few vessels are equipped with forced ventilation systems. I would underline that it performed adequately only while the ship was moving in open seas; it would not be effective while the ship was at anchor. Experts testified that a "natural" system of ventilation, such as this, would not facilitate air exchange far below in the holds.
[17]
The Atlantic crossing was relatively normal, although the ship encountered a storm between November 20 and 23, during which time seawater swamped the deck and the vent flaps on the hatches were kept closed. Testing of the eventual rust damage confirmed conclusively that the damage was not due to contact with sea water.
[18]
During the voyage, it was the responsibility of the chief officer to determine when to ventilate the holds. According to his testimony and entries in the log, the "flaps" remained closed during stormy days but were generally open during fair weather. He did not ventilate according to "dew point" readings taken from within the holds, as the plaintiff contended ought to have been done. "Dew point" readings were taken from the bridge and reported to the Belgium Weather Reporting Service; they were recorded at frequent intervals during the crossing and continued until the vessel entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence. I accept the evidence of the chief officer that to attempt readings with the holds would have been most impractical and that of Mr. Sparks who suggested that it was not necessary.
[19]
As stated earlier, the vessel reached the Gulf on November 24, 1984, and arrived at Les Escoumins east of Montreal November 26, 1984. It was unable to proceed on its voyage up the St. Lawrence Seaway system due to the collapse of the Valleyfield bridge and was forced to remain at anchor from November 27 until December 10. During this period, the ventilators were opened November 24, 25, 28, 30, December 2 and 7. The vessel docked at Toronto on December 13, 1984; it discharged its Hamilton cargo on December 16, and its Detroit cargo on December 19-20, 1984.
[20]
Before turning to an examination of the burden of proof, and the various allegations, it would be convenient at this time to set out the general results of the various surveys which were conducted upon the discharge of cargo.
The Hamilton, Ontario Cargo Surveys:
[21]
A first survey completed by Mr. Michael Talwar of International Marine Surveyors Limited, was undertaken on behalf of the plaintiffs on December 16, 1984, at Hamilton, Ontario, during discharge operations. He observes in his report that the vessel had previously off-loaded cargo at Toronto in adverse weather conditions. This was exceptionally done to enable the vessel to complete its deliveries as quickly as possible in view of the impending winter closing of the Seaway. He refers to Mr. Bernhardt, a surveyor retained by the defendants, who had informed him that they intended to continue discharge operations in spite of the adverse weather (rain, snow, etc). However, both Mr. Bernhardt's survey as well as the Log Book indicate that Hatch No. 5 was not opened at Toronto; therefore I cannot accept that any adverse weather in Toronto would have affected the Hamilton cargo stored in Hold No. 5.
[22]
Cargo was discharged from Holds No. 1, 3 and 5 at Hamilton but Mr. Talwar only reported on Holds 3 and 5. He observed that in Hold No. 5 in close proximity to the coils, the tank top was wet and damp; the stevedores had spread sawdust on it for better footing in order to enable them to work the cargo. Moisture or water was found on the rolls as well as the wrappers of the cold rolled steel coils, causing oxidization of the wrapper surfaces. The coils were partly exposed during discharging when fork-lifts used for handling on the dock gouged into the metal envelopes. He records that during discharge all metallic envelopes were wet or damp and water had accumulated on the wrappers and in the cores of the coils. The securing steel band straps were found rusted to some degree. One of the coils in particular, later found to be rusted and not useable, was noted to have "end-disc wrappers bent with contents partly visible and wet/damp on the edges"; rust was noted on wire rod coils stowed on top of the cold rolled steel. After discharge the steel cargo was stored in a closed warehouse adjacent to the wharf pending delivery to the consignee.
[23]
Mr. Talwar conducted a further survey of the same cargo commencing on February 14, 1985, in order to determine the nature and extent of damage sustained when it was unwrapped at the consignee's premises. It had been delivered to the consignee on or about January 8, 1985, and stored in a protected and heated shed adjacent to their processing plant. Prior to his attendance, on January 16, 1985, two of the coils were de-canned and rejected due to rust damage; this, it should be remembered, is some four weeks after being off-loaded from the ship. On examining the wrappers and the securing steel band straps, he determined that they were rust-stained or rusted. A portion of an additional coil was subsequently rejected due to rust; the balance was however undamaged and useable. The damaged items were disposed of as salvage for the sum of $2,549.26 U.S. It was his opinion that the rust damage was due to contact with fresh water such as rain or excessive condensation during the voyage. Silver nitrate tests confirmed that the shipment had not been in contact with sea water.
[24]
Two survey reports prepared by R.P. Bernhardt were submitted on behalf of the defendants; one was conducted at Toronto on December 13-15, 1984, the second at Hamilton on December 16, 1984.
[25]
I would note that in his report on the Toronto off-loading operations, Mr. Bernhardt recorded that a heavy ice storm occurred for several hours during Friday, December 14, 1984. At trial, however, he indicated that this ice storm occurred in the morning and I have already determined that Hatch No. 5 was not opened in Toronto. Although Hold No. 1, containing the zincrometal cargo, was worked in Toronto, off-loading did not commence until 13:50, and was stopped during a period of rain from 16:00 to 17:00; I can safely infer from the evidence and the ship's log that the hatches were closed and that the storm would not have affected the cargo in question.
[26]
At Hamilton, he observed that the steel coils stowed in Hold No. 5, including those under Bills of Lading 3 and 4, were covered with condensation; it was unknown at that time whether any moisture had seeped under the wrappers and onto the coils. On one or two packages, whose wrapping were torn, no condensation or rust was revealed on the coils themselves; on the other hand, coils of wire rod also stowed in Hold No. 5 were found to have rusted to varying degrees. In spite of the moisture sighted on the wrappers, Mr. Bernhardt noted that there appeared to be no damage on the coils themselves under Bills of Lading 3 and 4; at this stage the coils had not yet been de-canned.
The Detroit, Michigan Cargo Surveys:
[27]
Surveys were conducted on December 19 and 20, 1984, during the discharge operations at Detroit of the zincrometal cargo covered by Bills of Lading 130 and 132.
[28]
On behalf of the plaintiffs, Mr. Champness of Champness & Associates Inc., prepared a report based on a survey carried out by John G. Van Lieshout on the 19th and 20th of December, 1984. Although Mr. Van Lieshout's mandate was to examine the condition of the cargo in the holds prior to discharge, he did not actually enter the holds themselves. He wrote that the coils appeared to be generally in good order, with light atmospheric rusting on the packaging. The polyethylene sheeting that covered the coils in Hold No. 1 was in place and a black dust covered the coil wrappers beneath this sheeting. The hold appeared to be generally clean and dry, with "no sign of rust patching in pattern to indicate hatch leakage". The same observation was noted for Hold No. 5, which had held the previously discharged Hamilton cargo. The coils were taken immediately to an enclosed "transit shed", where they were stacked indoors in order to protect them from the elements until transhipped. No obviously damaged coils were observed.
[29]
On behalf of the defendants, Mr. Fisher of Fisher Marine Surveys attended the Detroit operations, and actually entered the holds in order to examine the cargo. His report indicates that the cargo of wire rod which was also stowed in Hold No. 1 showed very light atmospheric rust; there was no pattern of rust in the hold openings and no suspicions of seawater intrusion. Plastic sheeting that covered the cargo during the voyage to Detroit was noted. "Atmospheric rust" was found on the coil wrappers, as well as "some areas of moderate orange-coloured rust caused by dripping condensation and sweat". He noted also a "definite feeling of dampness" in this hold, which he attributed to condensation. He confirms that the coils were stored in the terminal warehouse subsequent to being off-loaded. One of the important observations in his conclusion was evidence of condensation and sweat in the holds. Nevertheless he added "this condition is normal for this time of year when vessels suffer extreme variances of temperature and humidity".
[30]
On behalf of the plaintiffs two subsequent surveys were carried out by John G. Van Lieshout on February 15 and March 29, 1985, some time after the zincrometal cargo had been shipped to the consignee's warehouse in mid-January. He found that the packaging was generally in good order; some rust appeared on the outside of the wrappers and bands and on the interior surfaces of the side covers. De-coiling disclosed a generally damp surface, with emulsification on the surface and the beginning of rust throughout. He testified that an exterior viewing of the condition of the wrappers prior to de-canning would not have given him cause for concern with respect to contents. He concluded that the rusting and emulsification was likely caused by atmospheric conditions encountered during transit, moisture entering through damaged outer wrappers. A number of coils were found with streaks or run-downs of rust, possibly from hatch sweat or drip-down. It was his opinion that the rust would have formed within the last 60 days at the outside, and could not have pre-existed the shipment since it was not fully "set up", or attached to the surface of the metal.
Issue:
[31]
In summary, the plaintiff's case is that the rust damage sustained by the steel cargoes was caused by condensation within the coils, brought about primarily by improper ventilation. The method of ventilation while the ship was on the high seas is not in issue; they point to the period of time the vessel sat at anchor in the St. Lawrence River, between November 25 and December 10. During this layover, two days of "freak" weather occurred; on November 28 and 29 temperatures rose to a high of +12 degrees Celsius and on one of these days, November 28, the ventilator flaps were opened. All of the evidence advanced, as well as submissions during argument, point to this one day of improper ventilation as having caused the temperature of the holds to warm up sufficiently to cause condensation and the resulting rust damage complained of.
[32]
Testimony revealed that the temperature of the cargo as well as the holds would have been approximately +7 degrees Celsius when departing Antwerp. Stowed far below in the holds, the primary agent affecting the temperature would have been the sea water, which was slightly above freezing during the crossing. This would have persisted while in the St. Lawrence River. Atmospheric temperatures would have decreased slightly during the course of the voyage both crossing the Atlantic and during the voyage up the St. Lawrence River, with the only exception being the two days of abnormally high temperatures while the ship lay at anchor. This rather startling change, I conclude, could not have reasonably been foreseen by the carrier.
[33]
In support of the theory that opening vents for one day while high atmospheric temperatures prevailed ultimately caused condensation and eventual rust damage, the plaintiffs relied primarily upon an expert's report prepared by Captain Clifford Parfett of Marine Surveyors of Canada Ltd., who also testified in these proceedings.
[34]
In the preparation of his opinion, Captain Parfett sought guidance and placed reliance on the depositions of Hans Caers, Lucien Deschang, Julien DeKeyser, the survey report of Michael Talwar and the field notes of the discharge survey at Detroit, as well as on the examinations for discovery of Clinton Barrans and Captain Hugo Vermoessen. In addition, he sought assistance from various documents produced during the course of the discoveries and the commission evidence.
[35]
Considering the importance of his findings, and the reliance placed on them by the plaintiffs, it is essential that his opinion be reviewed in detail.
[36]
Captain Parfett initially concludes that the steel shipment was professionally produced; it left the manufacturer's premises in good condition; the protective packaging was "above average" or "very good"; the transportation of the cargo from the shipper's premises to reception on the vessel was normal; and the shipment was adequately protected at all times. Although the evidence supports most of these findings, his conclusion on packaging was challenged. I conclude nevertheless, based on the evidence that it was in fact very acceptable within the trade. I do not agree, however, that the shipment was adequately protected at all stages and proceeded normally to the point of loading: the initial order which prompted the manufacture of the zincrometal had been cancelled and there was a delay of some weeks before a new purchaser could be found; both cargoes were stored in an open warehouse at the Antwerp dock for at least two weeks, where they were exposed to the moisture-laden air of the port. Although Captain Parfett acknowledges the two-week delay at Antwerp, and avers that the shipment was well-protected and cared for during this period, it is impossible to reliably determine the actual condition of the coils prior to loading.
[37]
Captain Parfett lists a number of factors which in his opinion contributed to dampness in the air surrounding the steel while in the holds, thus encouraging condensation and eventual rust. It was his view that the shipment was likely loaded in such a manner as to have been exposed to rain water at Antwerp. I find this conclusion contrary to the facts. He remarks that the ventilation equipment aboard the "Federal Danube" was rudimentary and inadequate; this also is not supported by the evidence. I am satisfied the method used was the accepted norm for such vessels. He notes that no dew point readings were taken from within the holds. This is quite correct, but no other expert who testified felt that the chief officer was under any strict obligation to take readings of that nature.
[38]
In reference to the use of plastic sheeting, which covered the cargo during the voyage, it was his opinion that this would have trapped warm air within or near the coils, preventing moisture from escaping. His most astonishing conclusion was that the cargo of ferro manganese, which he termed as having "significant moisture content", loaded in Hold No. 1 alongside the zincrometal cargo, was a serious source of continuous release of moisture into the air of the hold. Finally, he refers to the delay experienced by the vessel while at anchor in the St. Lawrence River, and the unseasonably mild weather; it was his view that the chief officer would have been faced with an extremely difficult task of caring for the cargo in Hold No. 1 particularly in attempting to avoid condensation and the subsequent rust damage. Captain Parfett determined that the rusting more than likely occurred for two reasons: improper care of the cargo at the time of loading and while at anchor, and the "unwise" stowing of the ferro manganese in the same hold as the zincrometal coils. This situation, he suggests, was further aggravated by the improper use of plastic sheeting. His reference to exposure to rain during the vessel's stay at Toronto was not supported by the evidence.
[39]
His conclusions as to the moisture level of the air in the holds, causing condensation and rust, are based on an erroneous assumption concerning the "hygroscopic" property of ferro manganese; in other words, that it has an innate capacity to retain water. He gave evidence that this type of bulk cargo is customarily stored in the open before loading and this encourages absorption of moisture which, he assumed, would be a potential source of continuous release of humidity in the air of the hold throughout the voyage.
[40]
At trial, I pointed out that I had strong reservations in accepting Captain Parfett's testimony as an expert regarding the allegedly hygroscopic nature of ferro manganese, since he was not qualified in the field of metallurgy. My suspicions were confirmed when the defendants called a metallurgist, Mr. Christopher Noel Mapp, whose evidence completely contradicted Captain Parfett's opinion concerning ferro manganese. It was abundantly clear that the Captain had confused ferro manganese, a hard, rock-like metal alloy, with manganese ore, a "crumbly, earth-like" substance. Mr. Mapp emphasized that ferro manganese is not considered to be "hygroscopic". Moisture would only adhere to the surface, and would eventually drip off; it would not be releasing moisture during a voyage at sea and it would not be considered inappropriate to store this cargo in the same hold with zincrometal coils. Captain Parfett would have been unchallenged had we been dealing with a cargo of manganese ore rather than ferro manganese. From the evidence, I find as a fact that the latter substance has no innate capacity to absorb water or release moisture into its immediate surroundings. I might also add that there was no indication on the mate's receipt that this cargo was wet before loading.
[41]
A detailed and thorough review of Captain Parfett's observations reveals that they are almost entirely reliant upon his incorrect assumptions concerning ferro manganese; I have come to the conclusion that his expert testimony has little probative value in determining the ultimate cause of the rust damage to the cargo. His assertion that dew point readings should have been taken from within the interior of the holds, to determine the proper time to ventilate, is an idealistic approach. Nowhere is it clear in his report how this procedure could have affected the proper storage of cargo.
[42]
Cargo sweat, or condensation, is discussed at some length in Tetley, Marine Cargo Claims (3rd Ed., Blais International Shipping Publications, Canada, 1988); also, I had the benefit of expert testimony from Arthur Sparks, author of Steel Carriage by Sea (Lloyd's of London Press, 1988). Generally one can conclude that the phenomena is not expected to develop when a vessel moves from a warm to a cool climate. Condensation forms when warm air is cooled to a point (the dew point), at which the excess moisture which the cooler air can no longer retain turns to liquid; thus as a cargo cools, the surrounding moisture-laden warmer air condenses on the cargo. A carrier is considered responsible for damage caused by condensation unless it takes all available and reasonable precautions to avoid sweat (Tetley, Marine Cargo Claims, pp. 912-913).
[43]
I am satisfied that as the cargoes left the port of Antwerp a temperature of approximately +7 degrees Celsius prevailed. Expert evidence has also satisfied me that temperatures generally decreased as the ship made its way through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. On this particular voyage, the temperature of the sea, being the main influence on the temperature of both cargo and the holds, remained constant at just above freezing; therefore, if anything, the temperature of the steel would have dropped slightly. Mr. Sparks testified that cargo sweat would have been unlikely to develop during transit, and the taking of dew point readings would not have been necessary.
[44]
Nevertheless, the plaintiffs argue that the crucial event was ventilating the hold when the prevailing temperature had attained +12 degrees Celsius while the vessel was at anchor in the St. Lawrence river. Undoubtedly, this procedure would have permitted warmer air to enter under the hatch covers. In any event, I am not persuaded that this slight intrusion of warmer air would have had any effect on the air surrounding the steel which was far below in the holds.
Burden Of Proof:
[45]
There has been an evolution in the law as it pertains to cargo damage caused by sweat. Originally, sweat damage was considered to be a peril of the sea, thereby exempting the carrier from liability under the provisions of the Hague Rules. As a result of technological improvements enabling carriers to better care for the cargo and to prevent sweat damage, it is no longer considered a peril of the sea, and the carrier bears additional responsibility. This is not to say, however, that negligence need not be established in order for the carrier to be liable for loss due to sweat damage.
[46]
Where damage due to "sweat" or condensation is in issue, the order of proof has been set out by William Tetley in Marine Cargo Claims as follows (at page 916):
"(a) the claimant must first prove his claim ...;
"(b) the carrier must then establish the cause of the damage that sweat caused the wetting, rusting, etc.;
"(c) thereafter the carrier must prove that due diligence was exercised to make the vessel seaworthy before and at the beginning of the voyage in respect to the loss. This means showing that the vessel had proper ventilation equipment, proper dunnage and air shafts to combat sweat, a crew trained in ventilating in accordance with dew point, and so on;
"(d) finally, the carrier may then prove that the damage resulted from a peril of the sea under art. 4(2)(c) [of the Hague Rules] or some other cause without its fault [under art. 4(2)(q)]. In doing so, the carrier must demonstrate that the sweat was inevitable and that neither it nor the crew contributed to the loss or damage;
"(e) the claimant at this point may make counter-proof of the lack of care of the cargo by the carrier under art. 3(2) or fault and privity of the carrier under art. 4(2)(q)."
[47]
At page 142, Tetley sets out the following facts necessary for the plaintiff/claimant to discharge his initial burden of proof of proving his claim under (a) above:
"(a) That the claimant is the owner of the goods and/or is the person entitled to make the claim.
"(b) The contract or the tort (delict).
"(c) That the person claimed against is the responsible person.
"(d) That the loss or damage took place in the carrier's hands. This is usually done by proving the condition of the goods when received by the carrier and the condition at discharge.
"(e) The physical extent of the damage or the loss.
"(f) The actual monetary value of the loss or damage."
[48]
It is clear from the jurisprudence that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the goods were damaged while in the carrier's possession; this is generally accomplished by proof that the goods were tendered in good condition to the carrier, and were ultimately received in a damaged condition. This accomplished, the carrier must show that the damage fits within an excepted clause of the Hague Rules; if they succeed, the onus shifts to the plaintiff to adduce evidence that the damage was caused by the carrier's negligence. If, on the other hand, the carrier cannot establish that the damage is due to an excepted cause, the burden remains on him to prove that the loss was not caused by his negligence. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Caemint Food Inc., [1981] A.M.C. 1801).
[49]
The clauses of the Hague Rules concerned in the present case are 4(2)(c) and 4(2)(q), as follows:
"Article IV
"(2) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from,
(c) perils, danger, and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters;
. . . . .
(q) any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier, or without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage."
[50]
The plaintiff's initial burden requires that it demonstrate that the goods were tendered for delivery in good condition; a clean bill of lading is generally accepted as establishing prima facie proof of this ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ); however, the court may consider all evidence tendered as to the preshipment condition of the goods. A clean bill of lading in some circumstances has been held to be insufficient to establish a prima facie case where goods are shipped in packages preventing any observation of the preshipment condition of the goods ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Caemint Food Inc., supra).
[51]
Turning to a review of the evidence, I would note that, upon leaving the place of manufacture, the cargo was packed in metal envelopes. This prevented an examination of the contents prior to shipment unless serious damage was suspected, in which case it would have been transported to a factory for "de-canning" which is, as I stated earlier, a costly procedure. There is nothing in the evidence which leads me to believe that any damage to the contents was or ought to have been suspected prior to loading onboard the "Federal Danube". This is not to say, however, that the cargo was necessarily in good condition at that point in time.
[52]
There are two factors which could, after consideration, permit an inference that the goods may not have been in good condition when they were loaded on board the vessel. It was clear, and I accept, from the evidence of Lucien Deschang that generally goods are manufactured and immediately shipped after an order is received. I have no doubt that the precautions taken during manufacture and transport to Antwerp are excellent. However, in the case of the zincrometal coils, the initial order which prompted their manufacture was cancelled; further both the zincrometal sheets along with the cargo of cold rolled steel sat in an open warehouse at the port, exposed to the moisture-laden air for some two or three weeks.
[53]
An indication that this may have had an adverse effect upon the cargo lies in the fact that, for both cargoes, a notation, was placed on the bills of lading prior to departure: that the envelopes were either partly rusted or white oxidated, indicating contact with moisture. All witnesses agreed that these were minor comments. However, even at discharge, it was evident that these were minor comments. However, even at discharge, it was evident that the light rusting of the packaging did not alert the surveyors to inspect for damage; statements made by Mr. Van Lieshout on behalf of the plaintiffs indicate that the damage did not become apparent until after de-canning the coils. Thus it appears to me that there is at least a possibility that moisture may have already penetrated the coils prior to shipping, which could subsequently have condensed and be the primary cause of the rust damage eventually discovered. The foregoing facts are sufficient in my mind, particularly where we are concerned with packaged goods, to stand in the way of the plaintiff being able to establish, as part of its prima facie case, that the cargo was moisture free and in good condition prior to being shipped.
[54]
In addition, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has proven that the cargo was discharged in a damaged state, so as to permit a prima facie inference that the damage occurred while in the carrier's possession. Although the outturn surveys indicated the presence of moisture, and light atmospheric rusting of the outer metal envelopes, there is no evidence establishing that there was damage to the coils themselves at the time of discharge. It was not until some four weeks later, when the coils were de-canned, that rust damage was discovered. During this time, the cargo had been stored in enclosed warehouses, where undoubtedly the atmospheric temperature was warmer than that of the cargo; had moisture penetrated the packaging it would no doubt have condensed on the coils and may have been the ultimate cause of rusting. John Van Lieshout, on behalf of the plaintiffs, testified that he would not have suspected the damage found to the coils based simply on an examination on the packaging; further, in his opinion the rust had formed within the previous one or two months at most. This, I conclude, raised the possibility that rust formed subsequent to discharge.
[55]
In the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  there was no reliable evidence of the preshipment condition, and the coils were not de-canned and examined until several months subsequent to discharge. It was held that the plaintiffs had not established a prima facie case of liability. This was so even though there was evidence of wetting during transit. The court concluded as follows:
"In this regard, Acwoo's failure to open any of the coils for evaluation is fatal to its contention at trial" (p. 2906).
. . . . .
"Acwoo has failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that acts of the charterer negligently caused the rust damage which undeniably occurred" (p. 2907).
[56]
Although the plaintiff has not proven that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good condition and discharged in damaged condition, it may still be able to establish that the damage was due to acts of the carrier. In Caemint Foods, supra, the court stated at p. 1813:
"A shipper or consignee who has not proved delivery in good condition may nevertheless establish a prima facie case for recovery by producing sufficient evidence that the nature of the damage suffered indicates that the damage occurred while the cargo was in the carrier's custody."
[57]
In order to convince the court that the damage occurred while the cargo was in the carrier's custody, the plaintiff would have to establish, by a preponderance of evidence, that the proximate cause of the rust was either precipitation or condensation forming in the ship's hold. The evidence before me as to the proximate cause of the rust damage is insufficient to establish, on balance, that it occurred during the period of the defendant's custody. Mr. Parfett's report is not sufficiently reliable, and the evidence of the surveyors is inadequate to support such a finding. It is just as conceivable that the rusting was due to moisture entering the coils prior to loading, or that condensation which developed either during discharge operations or possibly at sea, due to circumstances beyond the defendant's control, began to cause rust when allowed to sit in warehouses for between one and two months subsequent to discharge.
[58]
If the damage occurred during the period that the cargo was in the carrier's custody, the only possible act of negligence relied upon was when the ventilator hatches were opened during one day of unseasonably high temperatures while the vessel sat at anchor in the St. Lawrence River due to the closing of the Valleyfield bridge. However, no conclusive evidence was tendered to satisfy me as to the period of time that must elapse before light rusting occurs, or if one day of improper ventilation would be sufficient to cause the damage complained of. In the absence of reliable evidence of a causal connection, I am not satisfied that responsibility for contributing to the rust damage ought to be placed on the defendant's shoulders.
[59]
Further, even if this delay and unseasonably warm weather did contribute to the damage sustained, I would be prepared to hold that this was either a peril of the sea within art. 4(2)(c), or in any event due to factors beyond the defendant's control, and coming within art. 4(2)(q) of the Hague Rules.
[60]
Circumstances over which the carrier has no control, or intervening acts by third parties, which prevent a carrier from properly completing his undertaking, may be considered an exception under the Hague Rules. As a corollary, the closing of the Valley-field bridge, causing a delay of some 14 days, may, in my opinion, be considered as falling within the exception. An event that one could not have foreseen should prima facie be within the exempting provisions of the Rules, absent of any evidence of acts of the carrier having contributed to the loss.
[61]
Could it be said here that there is a want of reasonable skill or care on the part of the carrier that would have caused or contributed to the damage to this cargo? The plaintiffs are relying on conclusions arrived at by Captain Parfett, whose thesis was primarily based on an erroneous finding of fact that ferro manganese was hygroscopic, contributing moisture to the air in the hold. Allowing that there may have been moisture in the air, the only possible source of condensation was when the ventilation flaps were open for one day when the atmospheric temperature was unseasonably high. To suggest that liability could rest on the defendant for these unforeseen circumstances, when the ship was delayed for some 14 days by an incident over which the carrier had no control, seems distant and ludicrous. Were it not for this event, the ship would have arrived some two weeks earlier and have avoided the high temperatures; from the facts, there is not one iota of evidence of negligence during the voyage which might reasonably be said to have contributed to the damage.
[62]
If one were to accept that the opening of the flaps for one day was a negligent act of the defendant, against this lies the weight of the conflicting testimony, which suggests several other possible causes of the rust, negating any responsibility of the defendant. After hearing such conflicting testimony, could it not be said that there was moisture in the coils as a result of storage in the open shed at Antwerp for two weeks, or alternatively, that any moisture that may have entered the coils even subsequent to loading was more likely to condense and cause rust when stored in warehouses for four weeks or more, where undoubtedly the temperature was much greater than the cargo?
[63]
In view of the foregoing, I would conclude that either the plaintiff has not met its burden of establishing a prima facie case of liability, or alternatively that the defendants have established that the damage was not due to any act of negligence on their part. The plaintiffs' action is therefore dismissed with costs to the defendants.
[64]
Although I have dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, it is incumbent upon me to assess damages. With respect to the claim for the cargo destined for Hamilton (Action No. T-2395-85), I hereby assess damages at $2,549.26 U.S. With respect to the claim for the cargo destined for Detroit (Action No. T-1699-85), I am satisfied that the Hague-Visby Rules apply and hereby establish the damages at $95,811.44 U.S.
[65]
Costs to the defendants.
Action dismissed.
