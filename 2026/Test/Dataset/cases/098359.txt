I. Introduction
[1]
Scott, J.
[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review, submitted in accordance with subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), of the decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board (panel), dated April 4, 2011, that Rodrigo Ocampo Aguilar (principal applicant), his spouse, Irma Gordillo Enciso, and their four children, Victor Manuel, Carlos Alberto, both minors, and Jose Salvador and Rodrigo Ocampo Gordillo, both the age of majority (applicants), are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.
[2]
For the following reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed.
II. Facts
[3]
The applicants are all citizens of Mexico.
[4]
The principal applicant was a taxi driver in Mexico City. He alleges that he had several problems with two drug traffickers, El Pelon and El Cejon, who live close to his house.
[5]
On March 21, 2008, the principal applicant returned from work and noticed El Pelon and El Cejon doing business in front of his house. He asked them to leave the premises, but the two individuals refused. An argument ensued and escalated into a fight. The principal applicant's children as well as other neighbours intervened and made the individuals leave.
[6]
The principal applicant did not file a complaint with the police against the two men because he feared the consequences for him and his family. Furthermore, he alleges that his neighbour Francisco already experienced problems with them and mysteriously disappeared in November 2007. His body was found one month later.
[7]
The principal applicant and his parents went to see El Pelon and El Cejon the day after their fight to ask them to stop. The two men refused and threatened to kill them if they decided to file a complaint with the authorities.
[8]
On April 15, 2008, the principal applicant returned home in his taxi. He again noticed the two men blocking his driveway. A new argument ensued. One hour later, one of them rang the principal applicant's doorbell and asked him to step outside, but the principal applicant refused. The man threatened to kill him, alleging that he was interfering with their business. The principal applicant and his son Rodrigo tried to restrain him, but he managed to break loose and run away. The man climbed into a Volkswagen vehicle and fired some shots. The principal applicant and his son avoided being hit.
[9]
The principal applicant still did not file a complaint with the police because he believes that the authorities are in collusion with traffickers.
[10]
The applicants left Mexico on July 3, 2008.
III. Legislation
[11]
Sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA read as follows:
Convention refugee
96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.
Person in need of protection
97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or
(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if
(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,
(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.
Person in need of protection
(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.

IV. Issues and standard of review
A. Issues
[12]
This application for judicial review raises two issues:
1. Did the panel breach its duty of procedural fairness by failing to share its concerns about the contradictions it identified between the applicants' account and their testimony at the hearing?
2. Did the panel err by finding that the applicants' factual story was not credible?
B. Standard of review
[13]
The panel's obligation to allow the principal applicant to respond to its concerns about the contradictions is a question of procedural fairness to be assessed on the standard of correctness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (Azali)).
[14]
The Court also finds, in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] FCJ No 438 at paragraph 26, that the standard of review applicable to assessing credibility is reasonableness (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] FCJ No 196 at paragraph 16).
V. Positions of the parties
A. Position of the applicants
[15]
The principal applicant maintains that the panel's findings surrounding the events of March 21, 2008, are unreasonable. He claims that the panel erred by stating that it is implausible that the altercation with his attackers occurred inside his taxi. The principal applicant emphasizes that he has only nine years of education and that it is possible that he failed to specifically mention getting out of his taxi on March 21, 2008, when he replied to the questionnaire in his Personal Information Form (PIF).
[16]
The principal applicant also argues that the panel never informed him of its concerns with respect to the events on March 21, 2008, and thus breached its duty of procedural fairness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
The principal applicant alleges that the panel drew an unreasonable inference from his failure to include background on the events of March 22, 2008 in his PIF. The panel wrote, at paragraph 20 of its decision, "[that it] does not believe that the claimant went to the home of these two drug dealers . . . he does not mention in his narrative that they accompanied him". The principal applicant contends that this finding is perverse because this was an innocent omission, as the Court explains in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[18]
The principal applicant also submits that the panel erred by finding that there was an apparent contradiction between his PIF and his testimony at the hearing. The panel wrote the following at paragraph 18 of its decision: " . . . On that topic, the panel asked whether, on March 22, these men had said anything else to him, and he replied [translation] 'not that I remember' . . . . The panel noted that it is stated in his narrative that he received death threats on that day, and the claimant stated emphatically that he did not receive death threats, which surprised the panel". The principal applicant points out that he provided a reasonable explanation by stating that he received, instead, implicit threats by the two drug traffickers.
[19]
Furthermore, the principal applicant characterizes the contradiction between his testimony and that of his son concerning the incident of April 15, 2008, as minor. Contrary to what the panel wrote in its decision, the principal applicant's son did not mention that two men came to the family home to have a discussion with his father. Rather, he explained the situation to the immigration officer in general terms.
[20]
The panel did not consider the facts surrounding the murder of Jose Ocampo Aguilar, the principal applicant's brother. The principal applicant emphasizes the importance of this omission because the panel must examine the risks the applicants would face if they were to return to Mexico. According to the principal applicant, the panel made a fundamental error by excluding this important piece of evidence from its analysis.
[21]
The principal applicant argues that the accumulation of material errors committed by the panel warrants the intervention of this Court.
B. Position of the respondent
[22]
In reply, the respondent argues the contrary. The panel made a reasonable finding that there was a major contradiction between the principal applicant's PIF and his testimony on the altercation of March 21, 2008. The principal applicant provided an exhaustive description of the March 21 events in his PIF and did not mention the fact that the traffickers forced him to get out of his car before physically attacking him. The respondent emphasizes that it is recognized in case law that omissions from a PIF may be a basis for negative conclusions as to credibility (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
Furthermore, the respondent claims that the principal applicant's education level is of no relevance in this case. All applicants have an obligation to submit a reliable application, especially when they received legal advice. Thus, when there is a major difference between an applicant's PIF and his or her testimony at the hearing, the panel may draw negative inferences and make a finding of lack of credibility.
[24]
According to the respondent, the panel was entitled to think that it was implausible that the principal applicant met with El Pelon and El Cejon the day after the altercation. Furthermore, the principal applicant adjusted his testimony to make it conform to the account in his PIF. He initially talked about death threats uttered against him and his family and then about insults and then went back to his earlier version. The respondent emphasizes that given such variations in a testimony, it becomes entirely open to the panel to make a finding of lack of credibility for the applicant.
[25]
Regarding the sequence of events on April 15, 2008, the panel noted a major contradiction between the principal applicant's statements and those of his son, Rodrigo. The principal applicant claims that a man came to his house to threaten him. The principal applicant's son provided a different version during his interview with the immigration officer on August 4, 2008. The principal applicant's son claimed that two men came to their home instead of one. However, he tried to adjust his testimony during the hearing stating that one of them arrived later and did not enter the principal applicant's home.
[26]
The respondent notes that it is settled law that answers provided to an immigration officer and a contradictory testimony or account before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) may undermine an applicant's credibility (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The respondent argues that it was open to the panel to find that the refugee claim was unfounded.
[27]
The respondent also maintains that the principal applicant was unable to establish a connection between his brother's murder and the problems with his two neighbours.
[28]
The respondent alleges that the panel based its lack of credibility finding on the accumulation of omissions, contradictions and implausibilities surrounding the key elements of the principal applicant's account. The panel heard the applicants orally and was therefore able to adequately assess their credibility (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
Finally, the respondent points out that a reviewing Court must not usurp the role conferred on the panel and carry out its own assessment of the evidence (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
VI. Analysis
1. Did the panel breach its duty of procedural fairness by failing to share its concerns about the contradictions it identified between the applicants' account and their testimony at the hearing?
[30]
The panel did not breach its duty of procedural fairness to the principal applicant in this case.
[31]
"Their duty of fairness does not require that the applicants be confronted with information which they themselves supplied" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 26).
[32]
Justice Tremblay-Lamer addressed a similar issue in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . She wrote the following at paragraph 16 of her decision:
[16] In my view, regard should be had in each case to the fact situation, the applicable legislation and the nature of the contradictions noted. The following factors may serve as guidelines:
1. Was the contradiction found after a careful analysis of the transcript or recording of the hearing, or was it obvious?
2. Was it in answer to a direct question from the panel?
3. Was it an actual contradiction or just a slip?
4. Was the applicant represented by counsel, in which case counsel could have questioned him on any contradiction?
5. Was the applicant communicating through an interpreter? Using an interpreter makes misunderstandings due to interpretation (and thus, contradictions) more likely.
6. Is the panel's decision based on a single contradiction or on a number of contradictions or implausibilities?
[33]
The case law cited above applies for determining whether the Court is faced with a breach of procedural fairness. In this case, we are of the opinion that the panel correctly communicated to the principal applicant its concerns on the plausibility of his account.
[34]
At page 472 of the IRB file, the panel reminded the principal applicant of the following: [translation] "Sir, you stated in your account that, on March 21, you returned home from work and saw them selling drugs in front of your house. And seeing this you stated: 'I went to see them to tell them to go elsewhere to conduct their business'. And then you tell us today that they forced you to get out of the car". It is clear and unequivocal that the panel communicated its concerns clearly to the principal applicant with respect to his version of the events of March 21, 2008. There was no breach of procedural fairness.
2. Did the panel err by finding that the applicants' factual story was not credible?
[35]
Assessing an applicant's credibility is a question of fact. Thus, it is within the expertise of the panel and is to be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )). The Supreme Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> reminds us that it must be determined whether the decision "falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law". The Court must show deference towards the panel in regards to credibility findings as long as these are reasonable and find basis in the elements of the evidence submitted (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 5).
[36]
In this case, the panel looked at three critical events of the refugee claim and identified several contradictions or omissions between the principal applicant's PIF and his testimony at the hearing.
[37]
First, the panel made an implausibility finding regarding the events of March 21, 2008, because it identified significant contradictions with respect to the confrontation between the principal applicant and the two drug traffickers. In his PIF, the principal applicant wrote the following:
[translation]
. . . I returned from work and noticed that El Cejon and El Pelon were selling drugs in front of my house. Seeing this, I went to see them to tell them to go elsewhere to do their business. They replied that they were on public property, that they could do what they wanted and that they would not go away . . . .
When they refused to leave the front of my house, I kept insisting that they go in front of their house to do their dirty work . . . . Because they would not listen, voices escalated and insults started flying all over the place. The situation deteriorated into an fist fight . . . .
[38]
The panel may "make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality and may also reject uncontradicted evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole" (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In this case, the panel noted a major contradiction on an essential element of the applicants' refugee claim.
[39]
The principal applicant recognizes his omission regarding the sequence of events on March 22, 2008. In his PIF, he does not mention going to the traffickers' house with his parents. The principal applicant refers to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In that case, the Court stated the following: "It is not incorrect to say that answers given in a PIF should be brief but it is incorrect to say that the answers should not be complete with all of the relevant facts. It is not enough for an applicant to say that what he said in oral testimony was an elaboration. All relevant and important facts should be included in one's PIF. The oral evidence should go on to explain the information contained in the PIF." (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 33).
[40]
In the Court's opinion, the panel had reason to find that this omission undermined the credibility of the applicants.
[41]
The principal applicant also notes that the panel erred by stating that he failed to mention in his testimony the death threats uttered against him by the drug traffickers. At the hearing, the principal applicant maintained this position. Nevertheless, the panel noted that the principal applicant wrote the following at lines 61 to 63 of his PIF: [translation] "they told us that if we made the mistake of filing a complaint against them, a member of my family would pay very dearly for it (they even went as far as telling us that they were going to kill us)" (see page 33 of the Tribunal Record). The Court recognizes the correctness of the respondent's position emphasizing, at paragraph 15 of his supplementary memorandum, that [translation] "the words 'were going to kill us' are explicit and are not implied, but clearly stated". This is an apparent contradiction and the panel correctly identified it.
[42]
The Court agrees with the principal applicant's position that the contradiction between his testimony and that of his son is minor. Nevertheless, the panel was entitled to find that this contradiction diminishes his credibility because it is in addition to other deficiencies. The panel wrote the following at paragraph 25 of its decision: "Because of these omissions and contradictions, the panel does not believe that the events of March 21 and 22 and of April 15 took place". The accumulation of contradictions was fatal to the applicants' credibility. This finding falls within the possible outcomes in this case.
[43]
Finally, it is important to note that the panel reasonably concluded that the murder of Jose Ocampo Aguilar, the principal applicant's brother, has nothing to do with the applicants' refugee claim. The principal applicant was not successful in establishing the connection between his brother's death and his refugee claim in Canada.
VII. Conclusion
[44]
The panel reasonably found that the applicants are not credible and that they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. The Court also wishes to emphasize that there was no breach of procedural fairness by the panel.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed; and
2. There is no question of general importance to certify.
.........................
Rodrigo Ocampo Aguilar, Irma Gordillo Enciso, Victor Manuel Ocampo Gordillo, Carlos Alberto Ocampo Gordillo, Jose Salvador Ocampo  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de révision judiciaire présentée aux termes du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001 c 27 [
LIPR
] qui vise la décision de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (ci-après le tribunal), rendue le 4 avril 2011, voulant que M. Rodrigo Ocampo Aguilar (demandeur), son épouse Mme Irma Gordillo Enciso et leurs quatre enfants, Victor Manuel, Carlos Alberto, tous les deux mineurs ainsi que Jose Salvador et Rodrigo Ocampo Gordillo, tous les deux majeurs (les demandeurs), ne sont pas des réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni des personnes à protéger aux termes de l'article 96 et du paragraphe 97(1) de la
LIPR
.
[2]
Pour les raisons qui suivent, cette demande de révision judiciaire est rejetée.
II. Faits
[3]
Les demandeurs sont tous citoyens du Mexique.
[4]
Le demandeur est chauffeur de taxi dans la ville de Mexico. Il allègue avoir eu plusieurs problèmes avec deux trafiquants de stupéfiants, El Pelon et El Cejon, qui habitent près de son domicile.
[5]
Le 21 mars 2008, le demandeur revient de son travail et aperçoit El Pelon et El Cejon qui transigent devant son domicile. Il leur demande de quitter les lieux, mais les deux individus refusent. Il s'ensuit une dispute qui se transforme en bagarre. Les enfants du demandeur ainsi que d'autres voisins interviennent et font fuir les deux individus.
[6]
Le demandeur ne porte pas plainte à la police contre les deux hommes car il craint les conséquences pour lui et sa famille. De plus, il allègue que son voisin Francisco a déjà eu des démêlés avec eux et est mystérieusement disparu en novembre 2007. Son corps a été retrouvé un mois plus tard.
[7]
Le demandeur et ses parents vont voir El Pelon et El Cejon le lendemain de leur dispute pour leur demander de ne plus récidiver. Les deux hommes refusent d'obtempérer et menacent de les tuer s'ils décident de porter plainte aux autorités.
[8]
Le 15 avril 2008, le demandeur revient de son travail avec son taxi. Il aperçoit de nouveau les deux hommes qui bloquent son stationnement. Il s'ensuit une nouvelle dispute. Une heure plus tard, l'un d'entre eux sonne à la porte du domicile du demandeur et lui demande de sortir à l'extérieur, mais le demandeur refuse. L'homme le menace de mort, alléguant que ce dernier interfère avec leur commerce. Le demandeur et son fils Rodrigo tentent de maîtriser l'homme, mais il réussit à se libérer et à fuir. L'homme monte dans une voiture de marque Volkswagen de laquelle il fait feu. Le demandeur et son fils évitent les tirs.
[9]
Le demandeur ne porte toujours pas plainte à la police puisqu'il croit que les autorités sont de connivence avec les trafiquants.
[10]
Les demandeurs quittent le Mexique le 3 juillet 2008.

IV. Questions en litige et norme de contrôle
A. Questions en litige
[12]
Cette demande de contrôle judiciaire soulève deux questions en litige:
1. Est-ce que le tribunal manque à son obligation d'équité procédurale en omettant de faire part de ses préoccupations face aux contradictions qu'il relève entre le récit des demandeurs et leurs témoignages à l'audience?
2. Est-ce que le tribunal commet une erreur en concluant que le récit factuel des demandeurs n'est pas crédible?
B. Norme de contrôle
[13]
L'obligation du tribunal de permettre au demandeur de répondre à ses doutes devant des contradictions est une question d'équité procédurale qui s'apprécie selon la norme de la décision correcte (voir la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ).
[14]
D'autre part, la Cour conclut, dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2009] ACF no 438 au para 26, que la norme de contrôle applicable, à l'appréciation de la crédibilité, est celle de la décision raisonnable (voir aussi l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 196 au para 16).
V. Positions des parties
A. Position des demandeurs
[15]
Le demandeur soutient que les conclusions du tribunal, entourant les évènements du 21 mars 2008, sont déraisonnables. Il prétend que le tribunal erre en affirmant qu'il est invraisemblable que l'altercation avec ses agresseurs soit survenue à l'intérieur de son taxi. Le demandeur souligne qu'il n'a que neuf ans de scolarité et qu'il se peut qu'il n'ait pas spécifiquement mentionné être sorti de son taxi le 21 mars 2008, lorsqu'il a répondu au questionnaire contenu dans son formulaire de renseignements personnel [FRP].
[16]
Le demandeur soutient également que le tribunal ne l'avise pas de ses doutes sur les évènements du 21 mars 2008, contrevenant ainsi à son obligation d'équité procédurale (voir la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[17]
Le demandeur allègue que le tribunal tire une inférence déraisonnable de son omission d'insérer le contexte des évènements du 22 mars 2008 dans son FRP. Le tribunal écrit, au paragraphe 20 de sa décision, « [qu'il] ne croit pas que le demandeur se soit rendu chez ces deux vendeurs de drogue, [...] il ne mentionne pas s'y être rendu avec eux dans son histoire». Le demandeur soutient que cette conclusion est abusive puisqu'il s'agit d'une omission innocente, tel que l'explique la Cour dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[18]
Le demandeur prétend également que le tribunal erre en concluant à une contradiction apparente entre son FRP et son témoignage à l'audience. Le tribunal écrit, au paragraphe 18 de sa décision: « [...] Le tribunal reviendra sur le même sujet pour demander si, le 22 mars, ces hommes lui ont dit autre chose et il répond "que je me souvienne, non" [...] Le tribunal souligne que ce jour-là, il déclare dans son récit avoir reçu des menaces de mort et le demandeur déclare fermement qu'il n'a pas reçu de menaces de mort, ce qui étonne le tribunal ». Le demandeur rappelle qu'il fournit une explication raisonnable en affirmant qu'il a plutôt reçu des menaces implicites de la part des deux trafiquants de drogue.
[19]
D'autre part, le demandeur qualifie de mineure la contradiction entre son témoignage et celui de son fils concernant l'incident du 15 avril 2008. Contrairement à ce que le tribunal écrit dans sa décision, le fils du demandeur ne mentionne pas que deux hommes se sont rendus au domicile familial pour discuter avec son père. Il a plutôt expliqué la situation à l'agent d'immigration en termes généraux.
[20]
Le tribunal ne tient pas compte des faits entourant l'assassinat de M. Jose Ocampo Aguilar, le frère du demandeur. Le demandeur souligne l'importance de cette omission puisque le tribunal doit se pencher sur les risques que subiraient les demandeurs advenant leur retour au Mexique. Selon le demandeur, le tribunal commet une erreur fondamentale en écartant cet élément de preuve important de son analyse.
[21]
Le demandeur soutient que le cumul d'erreurs matérielles commises par le tribunal appelle l'intervention de cette Cour.
B. Position du défendeur
[22]
En réponse, le défendeur soutient le contraire. Le tribunal conclut raisonnablement à une contradiction importante entre le FRP du demandeur et son témoignage sur l'altercation du 21 mars 2008. Le demandeur a décrit de façon exhaustive les évènements du 21 mars dans son FRP et ne fait aucunement mention du fait que les trafiquants l'ont fait descendre de force de sa voiture avant de l'agresser physiquement. Le défendeur souligne qu'il est admis par la jurisprudence que les omissions au FRP peuvent être source de conclusions négatives en matière de crédibilité (voir les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
De plus, le défendeur soutient que le niveau de scolarité du demandeur n'a rien à voir en l'instance. Tout demandeur a l'obligation de présenter une demande digne de foi, surtout lorsqu'il est conseillé par un avocat. Ainsi, dans la mesure où il existe une différence significative entre le FRP d'un demandeur et son témoignage à l'audience, le tribunal peut tirer des inférences négatives et conclure à un manque de crédibilité.
[24]
Selon le défendeur, le tribunal peut penser qu'il est invraisemblable que le demandeur ait rencontré El Pelon et El Cejon le lendemain de l'altercation. De plus, le demandeur modifie son témoignage pour le faire concorder avec le récit de son FRP. Au début, il parle de menaces de mort proférées contre lui et sa famille puis d'insultes pour en revenir à la première version. Le défendeur souligne que devant de telles variations dans un témoignage, il devient tout à fait loisible au tribunal de conclure à un manque de crédibilité du demandeur.
[25]
Sur le déroulement des évènements du 15 avril 2008, le tribunal constate une contradiction importante entre les déclarations du demandeur et celles de son fils, Rodrigo. Le demandeur prétend qu'un homme est venu à son domicile afin de le menacer. Le fils du demandeur présente une version différente lors de son entrevue avec l'agent d'immigration le 4 août 2008. Le fils du demandeur prétend que deux hommes se sont présentés à leur résidence au lieu d'un. Toutefois, il tente d'ajuster son témoignage durant l'audience et mentionne que l'un d'eux est arrivé plus tard et n'est pas entré dans le domicile du demandeur.
[26]
Le défendeur affirme qu'il est de jurisprudence constante que les réponses données à un agent d'immigration et un récit ou un témoignage contradictoire devant la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada [CISR] peuvent miner la crédibilité d'un demandeur (voir les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Le défendeur fait valoir qu'il est loisible au tribunal de conclure que la demande d'asile n'est pas fondée.
[27]
Le défendeur soutient aussi que le demandeur n'a pu établir un lien entre l'assassinat de son frère et les problèmes avec ses deux voisins.
[28]
Le défendeur allège que le tribunal fonde son constat d'absence de crédibilité sur le cumul d'omissions, de contradictions et d'invraisemblances entourant les éléments clés du récit du demandeur. Le tribunal entend les demandeurs de vive voix il peut donc évaluer adéquatement leur crédibilité (voir les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
Finalement, le défendeur rappelle que la Cour, lorsqu'elle siège en matière de révision judiciaire, ne doit pas usurper le rôle dévolu au tribunal et compléter sa propre appréciation de la preuve (voir les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
VI. Analyse
1. Est-ce que le tribunal manque à son obligation d'équité procédurale en omettant de faire part de ses préoccupations face aux contradictions qu'il relève entre le récit des demandeurs et leurs témoignages à l'audience?
[30]
Le tribunal ne commet aucun manquement à son obligation d'équité procédurale envers le demandeur en l'instance.
[31]
« L'obligation d'équité n'exige pas que les demandeurs soient confrontés à des renseignements qu'ils ont eux-mêmes fournis» (voir la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> précitée au para 26).
[32]
La juge Tremblay-Lamer traite d'une question analogue dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Elle écrit, au paragraphe 16 de sa décision:
[16] À mon avis, il s'agit de regarder dans chaque dossier la situation factuelle, la législation applicable et la nature des contradictions notées. Les facteurs suivants peuvent servir de guide:
1. La contradiction a-t-elle été découverte après une analyse minutieuse de la transcription ou de l'enregistrement de l'audience ou était-elle évidente?
2. S'agissait-il d'une réponse à une question directe du tribunal?
3. S'agissait-il d'une contradiction réelle ou uniquement d'un lapsus?
4. Le demandeur était-il représenté par avocat, auquel cas celui-ci pouvait l'interroger sur toute contradiction?
5. Le demandeur communiquait-il au moyen d'interprète? L'usage d'un interprète rend les méprises attribuables à l'interprétation (et alors, les contradictions) plus probable.
6. Le tribunal fonde-t-il sa décision sur une seule contradiction ou sa décision est-elle fondée sur plusieurs contradictions ou invraisemblances ?
[33]
La jurisprudence citée ci-dessus s'applique pour déterminer si la Cour est devant un manquement à l'équité procédurale. En l'instance, nous sommes d'avis que le tribunal communique correctement ses doutes sur la vraisemblance de son récit au demandeur.
[34]
À la page 472 du dossier de la CISR, le tribunal fait un rappel au demandeur: « Monsieur, vous racontez dans votre histoire que le 21 mars vous arriver de travailler, vous les voyez en train de vendre de la drogue devant chez vous. Et voyant ça [vous dites]: "je suis allé les voir pour leur dire d'aller faire leurs petites affaires ailleurs". Donc là vous nous racontez aujourd'hui qu'ils [vous] ont forcé à sortir de la voiture ». Il est clair et sans équivoque que le tribunal communique clairement ses préoccupations au demandeur au sujet de sa version des évènements du 21 mars 2008. Il n'y a pas de manquement à l'équité procédurale.
2. Est-ce que le tribunal commet une erreur en concluant que le récit factuel des demandeurs n'est pas crédible?
[35]
L'appréciation de la crédibilité d'un demandeur est une question de fait. Ainsi, elle relève de l'expertise du tribunal et doit être revue selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (voir la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ). La Cour Suprême dans l'affaire
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ous rappelle qu'il faut déterminer si la décision « appartient aux issues possibles et acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». La Cour doit faire preuve de retenue à l'égard des conclusions du tribunal qui portent sur des questions de crédibilité, pourvu qu'elles soient raisonnables, qu'elles s'appuient sur les éléments de preuve présentés (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> précitée, au para 5).
[36]
En l'espèce, le tribunal s'arrête à trois évènements essentiels de la demande d'asile et y trouve plusieurs contradictions ou omissions entre le FRP du demandeur et son témoignage à l'audience.
[37]
Dans un premier temps, le tribunal conclut à l'invraisemblance des évènements du 21 mars 2008, puisqu'il relève des contradictions importantes au sujet de l'affrontement entre le demandeur et les deux trafiquants de drogues. Dans son FRP, le demandeur écrit:
[...] je suis arrivé de travailler et je me suis aperçu que [El Cejon et El Pelon] étaient en train de vendre de la drogue devant chez moi. Voyant cela je suis allé les voir pour leur dire d'aller faire leurs petites affaires ailleurs. Ils m'ont répondu qu'ils se trouvaient sur la voie publique, qu'ils pouvaient faire ce qu'ils voulaient et qu'ils n'allaient pas se retirer [...]
Devant leur refus de se retirer devant chez moi, j'ai continué à insister auprès d'eux pour qu'ils s'en aillent devant chez eux faire leur sale boulot [...] Comme ils ne voulaient rien entendre, le ton a monté et les insultes ont commencé à fuser de toutes parts. La situation a dégénéré pour se transformer en un affrontement à mains nues [...]
[38]
Le tribunal peut « tirer des conclusions raisonnables fondées sur des invraisemblances, le bon sens et la raison, et peut aussi rejeter des éléments de preuves qui ne sont pas contredits si ceux-ci ne sont pas compatibles avec son analyse globale de l'affaire » (voir la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En l'espèce, le tribunal constate une contradiction importante sur un élément essentiel de la demande d'asile des demandeurs.
[39]
Le demandeur reconnaît son omission par rapport au déroulement des évènements du 22 mars 2008. Dans son FRP, il ne mentionne pas s'être rendu au domicile des trafiquants, en compagnie de ses parents. Le demandeur cite la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans cette affaire, la Cour affirme qu'il « n'est pas inexact de dire que les réponses fournies dans un FRP devraient être concises, mais il est inexact de dire que ces réponses ne devraient pas contenir tous les faits pertinents. Il ne suffit pas à un requérant d'affirmer que ce qu'il a dit dans son témoignage oral était un développement. Tous les faits pertinents et importants devraient figurer dans un FRP. Le témoignage oral devrait être l'occasion d'expliquer les informations contenues dans le FRP » (voir la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au para 33).
[40]
La Cour considère que le tribunal a raison de conclure que cette omission vient miner la crédibilité des demandeurs.
[41]
D'autre part, le demandeur affirme que le tribunal erre en constatant qu'il a omis de mentionner dans son témoignage les menaces de mort proférées à son endroit par les trafiquants de drogue. À l'audience, le demandeur maintient cette position. Pourtant, le tribunal souligne que le demandeur écrit aux lignes 61 à 63 de son FRP « ils nous ont dit que si nous commettions l'erreur de porter plainte contre eux, un membre de ma famille allait le payer très cher (ils sont même allés jusqu'à nous dire qu'ils allaient nous tuer) » (voir la page 33 du dossier du tribunal). La Cour reconnaît la justesse de la position du défendeur qui souligne, au paragraphe 15 de son mémoire supplémentaire, que « les mots "allaient nous tuer" sont explicites et ne sont pas dans l'esprit mais bien clairement écrits ». Il s'agit d'une contradiction apparente et le tribunal la discerne correctement.
[42]
La Cour acquiesce à la position du demandeur voulant que la contradiction entre son témoignage et celui de son fils soit mineure. Le tribunal peut néanmoins conclure que cette contradiction porte atteinte à sa crédibilité puisqu'elle s'ajoute à d'autres manquements. Et comme le tribunal l'écrit au paragraphe 25 de sa décision « en raison de ces diverses omissions et contradictions, le tribunal ne croit pas que les événements du 21, 22 mars et 15 avril aient eu lieu ». Le cumul de contradictions porte un coup fatal à la crédibilité des demandeurs. Cette conclusion fait partie des issues possibles en l'instance.
[43]
Finalement, il importe de mentionner que le tribunal a conclu de façon raisonnable que l'assassinat de M. Jose Ocampo Aguilar, le frère du demandeur, n'a rien à voir avec la demande d'asile des demandeurs. Le demandeur n'a pas réussi à établir le lien entre le décès de son frère et sa demande d'asile au Canada.
VII. Conclusion
[44]
Le tribunal conclut raisonnablement que les demandeurs ne sont pas crédibles et qu'ils n'ont pas la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni de personnes à protéger aux termes des articles 96 et 97(1) de la
LIPR
. La Cour tient à souligner aussi qu'il n'y a eu aucun manquement de la part du tribunal à l'équité procédurale.
JUGEMENT
[45]
LA COUR STATUE que
1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée; et
2. Il n'y a aucune question d'intérêt général à certifier.
