INTRODUCTION
[1]
Russell, J.
: This is an application under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [Act] for judicial review of the decision of a visa officer [Officer], dated June 1, 2012, which denied an application for permanent residence in the Federal Skilled Worker [FSW] class.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of Iran who submitted an application for permanent residence as a Federal Skilled Worker. Under the relevant Ministerial instructions, only those with an Offer of Arranged Employment, those legally residing in Canada for at least one year as a Temporary Foreign Worker or International Student, or those who have work experience in certain listed occupations can apply through this program. The Applicant applied based on experience as an accountant under National Occupational Classification (NOC) 1111, Financial Auditors and Accountants, which is one of the eligible occupations.
[3]
The application for permanent residence was initially screened by the Central Intake Office in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and determined to be eligible for processing under the FSW class. The Applicant was invited to submit a full application package, which was referred to an overseas visa office for a final determination of eligibility. A visa officer in Ankara, Turkey denied the application, and the Applicant was notified of this decision by a letter dated June 1, 2012.
[4]
The "lead statement" for NOC 1111 states:
Financial auditors examine and analyze the accounting and financial records of individuals and establishments to ensure accuracy and compliance with established accounting standards and procedures. Accountants plan, organize and administer accounting systems for individuals and establishments. Articling students in accounting firms are included in this unit group. Financial auditors and accountants are employed by auditing and accounting firms throughout the private and public sectors, or they may be self-employed.
[5]
Under "main duties," NOC 1111 states that accountants perform some or all of the following duties:
• Plan, set up and administer accounting systems and prepare financial information for individuals, departments within organizations, businesses and other establishments
• Examine accounting records and prepare financial statements and reports
• Develop and maintain cost finding, reporting and internal control procedures
• Examine financial accounts and records and prepare income tax returns from accounting records
• Analyze financial statements and reports and provide financial, business and tax advice
• May act as a trustee in bankruptcy proceedings
• May supervise and train articling students, other accountants or administrative technicians.
DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[6]
The Officer determined that the Applicant was not eligible to immigrate in the FSW class because her work experience did not match the description of NOC 1111. In the Officer's view, the Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence that she had performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation, nor that she had performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties set out in the NOC.
[7]
The Officer found that the duties described in the two employment letters submitted in support of the application more closely resembled the duties of a bookkeeper (NOC 1231) or an accounting clerk (NOC 1431), which are not eligible occupations under the FSW. The Officer's May 29, 2012 notes from the Global Case Management System (GCMS Notes), which form part of the reasons for the Decision, read as follows:
...PA states has experience as an Accountant NOC 1111. PA submitted two employment letters in support of application. One is from Hafez Karan Sehat and states that PA prepared monthly reports and lists of salary, insurance, tax and submitted them to relevant organizations, analyzed proposed projects and determined profits and loss, prepared financial reports and data for employers and director. Second employment letter is from Iran Khodro and states that PA analyzed and calculated costs associated with "outbound delegates", calculated and paid daily allowances, prepared and issued foreign exchange bills. Am not satisfied, on the basis of the descriptions provided in employment letters that PA performed a substantial amount of the duties stated in NOC 1111. Her work experience more closely resembles that of a bookkeeper (NOC1231) or accounting clerk (NOC1431). Therefore, am not satisfied that the ministerial instructions have been met. ECP: Pls draft eligibility-not met ltr and refund all processing fees.
ISSUES
[8]
The Applicant raises the following issues in this Application:
a. Did the Officer breach a duty of procedural fairness by failing to inform the Applicant of his concerns regarding her employment experience and provide her an opportunity to address those concerns before rejecting the application?
b. Was the Officer's decision unreasonable?
STANDARD OF REVIEW
[9]
The Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] held that a standard of review analysis need not be conducted in every instance. Instead, where the standard of review applicable to a particular question before the court is settled in a satisfactory manner by past jurisprudence, the reviewing court may adopt that standard of review. Only where this search proves fruitless, or where the relevant precedents appear to be inconsistent with new developments in the common law principles of judicial review, must the reviewing court undertake a consideration of the four factors comprising the standard of review analysis:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[10]
The Respondent argues that a visa officer's determination of eligibility for permanent residence under the FSW class involves findings of mixed fact and law, and is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 47-48 and 50-51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicant argues that this Application also raises issues of natural justice and procedural fairness, and that such questions are reviewable on a standard of correctness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Canada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[11]
I agree with the Applicant that, to the extent issues of procedural fairness arise here, they are reviewable on a standard of correctness:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Officer's decision regarding whether the applicant was eligible to immigrate under the FSW class is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
[12]
When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law." See <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 59. Put another way, the Court should intervene only if the Decision was unreasonable in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."

ARGUMENT
Applicant
Procedural Fairness
[15]
The Applicant argues that the Officer breached a duty of procedural fairness by not informing the Applicant of concerns regarding her employment experience and providing her an opportunity to address those concerns. This Court has previously held that the duty of fairness may "require visa officers to inform an applicant of their concerns or negative impressions regarding the case and give the applicant the opportunity to disabuse them":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) at paras 15-17. The duty to provide an opportunity to "disabuse" an officer of their concerns may apply "even when such concerns arise from evidence tendered by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. It is well established that the duty encompasses an officer's concerns relating to the credibility or authenticity of documents:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicant submits that it can also extend to concerns that the evidence is deficient or incomplete:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Gay
].
[16]
The Applicant says that while the NOC and the Regulations do not identify which of the duties listed in the NOC description are considered to be "essential", or what constitutes a "substantial number" of the main duties of an occupation, the applicable departmental manual states that this is a determination to be made by officers on a case-by-case basis, and "in cases where officers have concerns about whether or not the applicant has carried out 'a substantial number of the main duties ... including all of the essential duties,' they should give the applicant an opportunity to respond to these concerns": OP6A Manual, section 10.13.
[17]
This Court has held that where a person has complied with the requirements of the Act, and should not reasonably have anticipated the Officer's concerns, the failure to provide notice of the concerns and an opportunity to respond is a breach of natural justice:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, the Applicant had offered
prima facie
evidence that she met the description of an accountant set out in NOC 1111, and she therefore could not have anticipated that the Officer would have concerns on this point, or would conclude that she was a bookkeeper or a clerk. The Applicant argues that her Affidavit filed with this application shows that had the officer expressed these concerns, she could have provided further evidence, explanations and details of her job duties that would have alleviated those concerns.
[18]
While there is no duty on an Officer to advise the Applicant of concerns that arise directly from the Regulations, an applicant must be advised of concerns that relate to credibility and accuracy. Concerns regarding the documentation and evidence submitted to prove a legal requirement can be credibility concerns, because they relate to the accuracy of the statements and documentation at issue: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 38;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Gay
, above at paras 32, 38-39. In other words, when the Officer doubts statements in the Applicant's evidence, that is a credibility concern. This is not a case where the Applicant failed to provide evidence to satisfy a legal requirement, but rather a case where the Officer had unanticipated questions about the authenticity of the documentation and statements provided. The Officer doubted the Applicant's statements that she was an accountant, and doubted the employment letters that confirmed that she worked as an accountant.
Reasonableness of the Decision
[19]
The Applicant also argues that the Officer's finding that the Applicant is not an accountant, but is rather a bookkeeper or accounting clerk, is unreasonable. She has the qualifications of an accountant and is working as an accountant, performing the duties listed in NOC 1111.
[20]
Recent case law interprets the requirement for FSW applicants to have performed all of the "essential" duties and a "substantial number" of the main duties set out in the NOC description (see subsection 75(2)(c) of the Regulations) to mean that the applicant must have performed "one or more of the main duties":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  IMM-7376-12). An Officer who requires an applicant to have performed all of the duties listed in the NOC description is essentially adding requirements and changing the applicable legal standard, and thereby acting in excess of their jurisdiction:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
While the NOC is legally binding, it should not be meticulously construed, but should rather be given a broad interpretation:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[22]
The Applicant has a degree in accounting, provided two job letters confirming that she has work experience as an accountant, and has consistently stated that this is her occupation. Her job letter from Hafez Karan Sehat states that she holds the position of accounting expert and head of the salary and wage section, and lists her duties as including:
• Preparing monthly reports and lists of salary, insurance and tax and their submission to the relevant sections and organizations;
• Analyzing the (sic) proposed projects and determining their profit and loss and also reporting them to the Managing Director for making due decision (sic);
• Preparing financial reports and data for employers and the Managing Director.
[23]
The Applicant submits that this letter demonstrates that she has performed:
• The first main duty listed in the NOC, "...prepare financial information for individuals, departments within organizations, businesses and other establishments," because she prepares monthly reports and lists of salaries, insurance and tax and submits them to various sections and organizations within the company;
• The second main duty, "[e]xamine accounting records and prepare financial statements and reports," because she prepares financial reports; and
• The fifth main duty, "[a]nalyze financial statements and reports and provide financial, business and tax advice," because she analyzes proposed projects from an accounting perspective, determining their profit and loss, and provides reports and advice on the projects, which necessarily implies that she analyzes the company's financial reports.
[24]
The Applicant's second job letter also demonstrates that she has performed the duties in NOC 1111, as it shows that she was responsible for analyzing financial records to calculate costs associated with outbound delegates, and for preparing financial reports and financial information for individuals in the process of preparing and issuing foreign exchange bills for delegates.
[25]
Both letters show she had more responsibility than a bookkeeper or an accounting clerk, the Applicant says. Unlike those occupations, an accountant is responsible for analysis and providing reports based on financial analysis, and the letters show that the Applicant performed these duties. The duties of a bookkeeper are focused solely on maintaining records. The duties of an accounting clerk are also predominantly administrative: maintaining records and preparing and processing bills. Neither occupation involves the kind of analysis and report preparation that the Applicant's jobs have entailed.
[26]
In addition, the Applicant says that the Officer's reasons are inadequate. The Officer did not explain why or how the duties listed in the job letters correspond to those of a bookkeeper or accounting clerk, and found that the Applicant has not performed the essential duties or many of the main duties without specifying what duties in the NOC are essential and which are main:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Applicant says that the Court's analysis in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pplies to this case. There, the Court found that it was impossible to assess the officer's conclusion that the applicant had not performed a substantial number of the main duties of the NOC category at issue without knowing which duties the officer thought had not been performed and why.
Respondent
Procedural Fairness
[27]
The Respondent argues that the Officer in this case was under no duty to make further inquiries about the Applicant's work experience. In the context of a skilled worker application, relevant work experience is a concern that arises directly from the requirements of the Act and Regulations, and a visa officer is under no duty to mention his or her concerns regarding that work experience to the applicant:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. More generally, an applicant's failure to provide adequate, sufficient or credible proof in support of a visa application does not trigger a duty to inform the applicant of concerns about the sufficiency or credibility of the proof provided: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 12; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 24.
[28]
The case law cited by the Applicant relates to credibility, which is not at issue in the present case. There were no specific concerns with the evidence. Rather, the Officer was not satisfied, on the basis of the evidence taken as a whole, that the Applicant had performed a substantial number of the duties stated in NOC 1111. The Applicant essentially argues that every application denied due to insufficient or unsatisfactory evidence involves a credibility issue - a proposition that has been rejected by this  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].
[29]
Similarly, a duty of procedural fairness does not arise whenever an officer has concerns that the applicant could not reasonably have anticipated. Rather, "[t]he onus is upon applicants to put together applications that are convincing and that anticipate possible adverse inferences contained in the evidence and local conditions and address them":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Here, the Respondent says, the Applicant simply did not put together convincing evidence that she had the required work experience.
Reasonableness of the Decision
[30]
The Respondent argues that the onus is on the Applicant to put her "best case forward." Here, the test established by the statutory scheme was not met; the Applicant failed to satisfy the Officer that she has work experience as an accountant:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 9. This conclusion was well within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes.
[31]
Neither the Applicant's assertion nor the employment letters were capable of establishing that she had performed the actions described in the lead statement for NOC 1111, and she did not provide sufficient evidence that she performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties set out in the NOC. Her degree and position title do not establish that she had work experience as an accountant: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 22. A visa officer is not required to speculate as to an applicant's experience in an occupation:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[32]
While an applicant is not required to have performed all of the main duties set out in the NOC description, he or she must have performed a few - that is, more than one. The task of a visa officer is to determine the "pith and substance" of the work performed:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCTD).
ANALYSIS
[33]
In my view, there is no procedural fairness issue in this case. The Officer had no concerns with respect to the Applicant's credibility or the accuracy and authenticity of the information and documentation she provided. There is no indication that the Officer doubted the veracity of the letters; he or she simply did not accept that the duties described in the letters brought the Applicant with the definition of "Accountant" as described in NOC 1111. The issue was whether the Applicant satisfied the requirements of the legislation, and the jurisprudence of the Court is clear that this does not give rise to procedural fairness issues. See, for example, Justice Kane's recent summary of the law in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Scott's recent analysis in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 26-29.
[34]
Also, in my view, there is no inadequacy of reasons issue in this case. As the Decision (including the GCMS notes) makes clear, the application was refused because the Applicant did not provide "sufficient evidence that [she] performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC ..." or that she had "performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties, as set out in the occupational description of the NOC." The reason why, in the Officer's view, this was the case was because "the duties described in your employment letters do not match the occupational descriptions of the NOC." These reasons are entirely transparent and intelligible within the meaning of para 47 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The only issue is whether the Decision is reasonable.
[35]
The Applicant points to her academic qualifications and job title as evidence that she performed accounting duties. However, academic credentials and job titles are not evidence of experience performing specific duties. As Justice Mosley pointed out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 22:
22 Here, there was no evidence before the agent to establish that the applicant had performed any of the duties required to satisfy the occupational classification.
It is not sufficient for an applicant to provide evidence that he or she has the academic qualifications, bears a job title and is addressed by that title in correspondence. They must provide evidence that they have actually performed "a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation"
. Here, the applicant did not provide that evidence either through the employer's certificate or alternate documentation. The information submitted fell short of establishing a
prima facie
case, as the applicant contends. [Emphasis added]
[36]
The lead statement for NOC 1111 for financial auditors and accountants provides that "Accountants plan, organize and administer accounting systems for individuals and establishments ...". The duties listed for NOC 1111 include the following:
• Plan, set up and administer accounting systems and prepare financial information for individuals, departments within organizations, businesses and other establishments;
• Examine accounting records and prepare financial statements and reports;
• Develop and maintain cost finding, reporting and internal control procedures;
• Examine financial accounts and records and prepare income tax returns from accounting records;
• Analyze financial statements and reports and provide financial, business and tax advice;
• May act as a trustee in bankruptcy proceedings;
• May supervise and train articling students, other accountants or administrative technicians.
[37]
In my view, there is nothing in the employment letters submitted to the Officer to suggest that the Applicant planned or organized accounting systems for either employer. The letters suggest that the Applicant's duties were confined to compiling lists and reports, determining profit and loss, preparing financial reports and data, and calculating and paying costs associated with outbound delegates. The Applicant has done some of the things that, according to NOC 1111, accountants do, but she has also done some of the things that a bookkeeper does under NOC 1231, or an accounting clerk does under NOC 1431. So the difficulty for the Officer was to determine where the Applicant fits into the scheme of the Act and the Regulations. As the Court pointed out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 10:
The real function of the visa officer is to determine what is the pith and substance of the work performed by an applicant. Tangential performance of one or more functions under one or more job categories does not convert the job or the functions from one NOC category to another.
[38]
Consequently, I cannot say that the Officer's conclusions in the GCMS notes that "on the basis of the descriptions provided in employment letters," he or she could not be satisfied that the Applicant "performed a substantial amount of the duties stated in NOC 1111" was unreasonable. There is obviously scope for disagreement over this finding, but I cannot say it falls outside of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range. In a tangential way, the Applicant has done some of the things that an accountant may do from time to time, but this does not mean that the pith and substance of the work she has performed fits under NOC 1111.
[39]
The Applicant concedes, for instance, that items 1 and 3 in the letter from Hafez Karan Sehat are just as likely to be performed by a bookkeeper or an accounting clerk. She says, however, that item 2 in the same letter is what raises her to the level of accountant and qualifies her under NOC 1111:
2 - Analyzing the proposed projects and determining their profit and loss and also reporting them to the Managing Director for making due decision.
[40]
She says that this is equivalent to one of the "Main Duties" under NOC 1111:
Analyse financial statements and reports and provide financial, business and tax advice.
[41]
I can see that both statements refer to analysis, but without more information a meaningful comparison is all but impossible. In any event, I do not think that this kind of possible overlap is sufficient to render the Applicant's experience, in pith and substance, that of an accountant. Or, more to the point, I do not think it is enough to take the Officer's Decision outside of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> range and render it unreasonable.
[42]
Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs.
JUDGMENT
[43]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
:
1. The application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), de la décision du 1er juin 2012 par laquelle un agent des visas (l'agent) a rejeté une demande de résidence permanente dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) (TQF).
CONTEXTE
[2]
La demanderesse est citoyenne de l'Iran. Elle a déposé une demande de résidence permanente dans la catégorie des TQF. Selon les instructions ministérielles pertinentes, seules les personnes qui ont une offre d'emploi réservé, les personnes qui résident légalement au Canada depuis au moins un an comme travailleurs étrangers temporaires ou comme étudiants étrangers, et les personnes qui ont une expérience de travail dans certaines professions admissibles, peuvent faire une demande au titre de ce programme. La demande repose sur l'expérience de la demanderesse en tant que comptable au sens du code 1111 de la Classification nationale des professions (CNP), Vérificateurs/vérificatrices et comptables (la CNP 1111).
[3]
La demande de résidence permanente a d'abord été analysée par le Bureau de réception centralisé des demandes de Sydney, en Nouvelle-Écosse, où on a conclu qu'elle pouvait être traitée au titre de la catégorie des TQF. La demanderesse a été invitée à déposer un dossier de demande complet, dossier qui a été renvoyé à un bureau des visas à l'étranger en vue d'une décision définitive quant à son admissibilité. Un agent des visas d'Ankara, en Turquie, a rejeté la demande. La demanderesse a été informée de cette décision par une lettre datée du 1er juin 2012.
[4]
L'énoncé principal établi pour la CNP 1111, Vérificateurs/vérificatrices et comptables, est ainsi libellé:
Les vérificateurs examinent et analysent les documents comptables et registres financiers de particuliers ou d'entreprises, afin d'assurer l'exactitude des documents en accord avec les principes comptables généralement reconnus. Les comptables planifient, organisent et administrent des systèmes de comptabilité pour des particuliers ou des entreprises. Les stagiaires des firmes de comptabilité sont inclus dans ce groupe. Les vérificateurs et les comptables sont employés par des firmes de comptabilité et de vérification des secteurs public et privé, ou ils peuvent être des travailleurs autonomes.
[5]
À la section « Fonctions principales », la CNP 1111 énonce que les comptables exercent une partie ou l'ensemble des fonctions suivantes:
• concevoir, mettre en œuvre et administrer des systèmes comptables et préparer des renseignements financiers pour des particuliers, des services à l'intérieur d'entreprises, de sociétés ou d'autres genres d'établissements;
• examiner les livres comptables, et préparer les états financiers et les rapports;
• concevoir et appliquer des méthodes d'établissement et de comptabilisation du coût de revient et des procédures de contrôle interne;
• examiner les états et les comptes financiers et préparer les déclarations de revenus;
• analyser les états financiers et les rapports et donner des conseils dans le domaine financier ou fiscal;
• remplir, à l'occasion, des fonctions de liquidateur dans des cas de faillite;
• superviser et former, s'il y a lieu, des stagiaires comptables, d'autres comptables ou des techniciens en administration.
DÉCISION FAISANT L'OBJET DU CONTRÔLE JUDICIAIRE
[6]
L'agent a conclu que la demanderesse n'est pas admissible à immigrer dans la catégorie des TQF parce que son expérience de travail ne correspond pas aux tâches décrites dans la CNP 1111. Selon l'agent, les éléments de preuve fournis par la demanderesse ne suffisaient pas à établir qu'elle avait exercé les fonctions décrites dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession, ni qu'elle avait effectué toutes les fonctions essentielles ou une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énoncées dans la CNP.
[7]
L'agent a estimé que les fonctions décrites dans les deux lettres d'emploi soumises à l'appui de la demande correspondent davantage aux fonctions d'un teneur de livres (CNP 1231) ou d'un commis à la comptabilité (CNP 1431), qui ne sont pas des professions admissibles dans la catégorie des TQF. Les notes de l'agent du 29 mai 2012, consignées au Système mondial de gestion des cas (les notes SMGC) et qui forment une partie des motifs de la décision, sont rédigées comme suit:
[traduction] La DP affirme avoir de l'expérience en tant que comptable au sens de la CNP 1111. La DP a présenté deux lettres d'emploi à l'appui de sa demande. L'une provient d'Hafez Karan Sehat. On y lit que la DP préparait des rapports mensuels et des relevés relatifs aux salaires, aux assurances et aux impôts, et qu'elle les transmettait aux organisations concernées, qu'elle faisait l'analyse des projets proposés et calculait les profits et les pertes, qu'elle préparait des rapports et des données d'ordre financier pour des employeurs et un directeur. La deuxième lettre d'emploi provient d'Iran Khodro. On y lit que la DP faisait l'analyse et le calcul des coûts associés aux « délégués externes », le calcul et le versement des indemnités journalières, et la préparation et la remise de fonds en devises étrangères. Je ne suis pas convaincu, sur la base des descriptions fournies dans les lettres d'emploi, que la DP exerçait une partie appréciable des fonctions décrites dans la CNP 1111. Son expérience de travail correspond davantage à celle d'un teneur de livres (CNP 1231) ou d'un commis à la comptabilité (CNP 1431). Par conséquent, je ne suis pas convaincu qu'il a été satisfait aux exigences des Instructions ministérielles. ECP: SVP rédiger lettre - conditions d'admissibilité non respectées; rembourser tous les frais de traitement.
QUESTIONS À TRANCHER
[8]
La demanderesse soulève les questions suivantes dans le cadre de la présente demande:
a. En n'informant pas la demanderesse de ses préoccupations concernant son expérience professionnelle et en ne lui donnant pas l'occasion d'y répondre avant de rejeter la demande, l'agent a-t-il manqué à une obligation d'équité procédurale?
b. La décision de l'agent était-elle déraisonnable?
NORME DE CONTRÔLE
[9]
Dans l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), la Cour suprême du Canada a déclaré qu'il n'est pas toujours nécessaire de se livrer à une analyse relative à la norme de contrôle. Ainsi, lorsque la norme de contrôle qui s'applique à la question particulière dont la cour est saisie a été établie de manière satisfaisante par la jurisprudence, il est loisible à la cour de révision de l'adopter. Ce n'est que dans les cas où cette recherche s'avère infructueuse, ou si la jurisprudence semble devenue incompatible avec l'évolution récente du droit en matière de contrôle judiciaire, que la cour de révision doit entreprendre l'examen des quatre facteurs de l'analyse relative à la norme de contrôle:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[10]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la décision de l'agent des visas concernant l'admissibilité à la résidence permanente dans la catégorie des TQF comporte des questions de fait et de droit, et qu'elle est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable: arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, paragraphes 47, 48, 50 et 51;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La demanderesse soutient que la présente demande soulève également des questions de justice naturelle et d'équité procédurale, et que de telles questions sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 9 et 10;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 44;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 43 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[11]
Je suis d'accord avec la demanderesse pour dire que, dans la mesure où des questions d'équité procédurale sont soulevées en l'espèce, elles sont susceptibles de contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte:
Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 100;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 53. La décision de l'agent concernant l'admissibilité de la demanderesse à immigrer dans la catégorie des TQF est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable.
[12]
Dans le cas du contrôle d'une décision suivant la norme du caractère raisonnable, l'analyse tient « à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ». Voir les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 47, et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 59, précités. Autrement dit, la Cour ne doit intervenir que si la décision est déraisonnable, en ce sens qu'elle n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit ».

ARGUMENTS
Demanderesse
Équité procédurale
[15]
La demanderesse allègue qu'en ne l'informant pas de ses préoccupations au sujet de son expérience de travail et en ne lui donnant pas l'occasion d'y répondre, l'agent a manqué à une obligation d'équité procédurale. La Cour a déjà statué que l'obligation d'équité « peut obliger l'agent des visas à informer le demandeur des préoccupations ou des impressions défavorables qu'il a au sujet de la demande et à donner à celui-ci la possibilité de le détromper »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), paragraphes 15 à 17. L'obligation de fournir une occasion d' « apaiser » les préoccupations d'un agent peut exister « même lorsque ces préoccupations découlent de la preuve [que les demandeurs] ont soumise »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 22 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Il est bien établi que cette obligation concerne les préoccupations d'un agent relatives à la crédibilité ou à l'authenticité de documents:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 21. La demanderesse soutient que cette obligation peut aussi s'étendre aux préoccupations concernant le caractère insuffisant ou incomplet de la preuve:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 32, 33, 38 et 39 (
Gay
).
[16]
Selon la demanderesse, bien que la CNP et son Règlement ne précisent pas quelles sont les fonctions énumérées dans la description de la CNP qui sont considérées comme « essentielles », ni ce qui constitue une « partie appréciable » des fonctions principales d'une profession, le guide applicable du Ministre précise que cette détermination doit être faite par les agents au cas par cas, et que « [s]i l'agent a des doutes sur le fait que le demandeur [a] accompli un "nombre substantiel de tâches principales, y compris toutes les tâches essentielles", il doit donner au demandeur la possibilité de dissiper ces doutes »: Guide OP6A, article 10.13.
[17]
La Cour a déjà statué que lorsqu'une personne s'est conformée aux exigences de la Loi, et qu'elle ne pouvait raisonnablement pas prévoir les préoccupations de l'agent, l'omission par l'agent d'informer cette personne de ses préoccupations et de donner à cette personne la possibilité d'y répondre constitue une atteinte à la justice naturelle:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 39 à 41. Dans la présente affaire, la demanderesse avait fourni une preuve
prima facie
que son travail correspondait à la description de la profession de comptable établie par la CNP 1111. La demanderesse ne pouvait donc pas s'attendre à ce que l'agent ait des préoccupations à ce sujet, ou qu'il arrive à la conclusion qu'elle exerçait la profession de teneur de livres ou de commis à la comptabilité. La demanderesse fait valoir que l'affidavit joint à la présente demande démontre que si l'agent lui avait fait part de ses préoccupations, elle aurait pu fournir des éléments de preuve, des explications et des précisions supplémentaires sur ses fonctions, ce qui aurait dissipé ses préoccupations.
[18]
Bien que rien n'oblige un agent à informer un demandeur des préoccupations qui découlent directement du Règlement, le demandeur doit être informé des préoccupations concernant la crédibilité et l'exactitude des renseignements fournis. Les préoccupations relatives aux éléments de preuve et aux documents fournis pour satisfaire à une exigence législative peuvent être assimilées à des questions de crédibilité, étant donné qu'elles ont trait à l'exactitude des déclarations et des documents en question: décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 38;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 27 et 28 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ); décision
Gay
, précitée, paragraphes 32, 38 et 39. En d'autres termes, si l'agent doute des déclarations figurant dans les documents de la demanderesse, il s'agira d'une question de crédibilité. Nous ne sommes pas en présence d'un cas où la demanderesse n'aurait pas fourni les éléments de preuve nécessaires pour satisfaire à une obligation légale, mais plutôt d'un cas où l'agent s'est retrouvé avec des questions imprévues concernant l'authenticité des déclarations et des documents de la demanderesse. L'agent doute des déclarations de la demanderesse lorsqu'elle affirme être comptable ainsi que des lettres d'emploi qui confirment son travail en tant que comptable.
Le caractère raisonnable de la décision
[19]
La demanderesse fait également valoir le caractère déraisonnable de la conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle elle n'est pas comptable, mais plutôt teneuse de livres ou commis à la comptabilité. La demanderesse possède les qualifications d'un comptable et travaille en tant que comptable, exerçant les fonctions décrites dans la CNP 1111.
[20]
La jurisprudence récente interprète l'exigence voulant que les demandeurs dans la catégorie des TQF aient exercé toutes les fonctions « essentielles » et une « partie appréciable » des fonctions principales décrites dans la CNP (voir alinéa 75(2)
c
) du Règlement) comme signifiant que les demandeurs doivent avoir exercé « au moins une des fonctions principales »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 18 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dossier de la Cour fédérale no IMM-7376-12). En fait, un agent qui exige d'un demandeur qu'il ait exercé toutes les fonctions décrites dans la CNP ajoute des exigences et modifie la norme juridique applicable, outrepassant ainsi ses compétences:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 8.
[21]
Bien que la CNP soit juridiquement contraignante, elle ne doit pas être interprétée avec méticulosité, mais plutôt au sens large:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 27.
[22]
La demanderesse possède un diplôme en comptabilité, a fourni deux lettres d'emploi confirmant son expérience professionnelle en tant que comptable, et a toujours affirmé que c'est sa profession. La lettre d'emploi d'Hafez Karan Sehat indique qu'elle occupe le poste d'expert-comptable et de chef de la section de la rémunération, et dresse la liste de ses fonctions, notamment:
• la préparation de rapports mensuels et de relevés relatifs aux salaires, aux assurances et aux impôts, et leur transmission aux organisations concernées;
• l'analyse des projets proposés et le calcul des profits et des pertes, ainsi que la communication de ces informations au directeur général pour qu'il prenne des décisions;
• la préparation de rapports et de données d'ordre financier pour les employeurs et le directeur général.
[23]
La demanderesse fait valoir que cette lettre démontre qu'elle exerçait:
• la première fonction principale décrite dans la CNP, soit « préparer des renseignements financiers pour des particuliers, des services à l'intérieur d'entreprises, de sociétés ou d'autres genres d'établissements », puisqu'elle préparait des rapports mensuels et des relevés relatifs aux salaires, aux assurances et aux impôts, qu'elle transmettait à diverses sections et organisations au sein de la société;
• la deuxième fonction principale, soit « examiner les livres comptables, et préparer les états financiers et les rapports », puisqu'elle préparait divers rapports financiers;
• la cinquième fonction principale, soit « analyser les états financiers et les rapports et donner des conseils dans le domaine financier ou fiscal; », puisqu'elle analysait les projets proposés dans une perspective comptable, calculait les profits et les pertes, préparait des rapports et prodiguait des conseils portant sur les projets, ce qui entraîne nécessairement l'analyse des rapports financiers de la société.
[24]
La deuxième lettre d'emploi de la demanderesse démontre également qu'elle exerçait les fonctions décrites dans la CNP 1111. Cette lettre indique que la demanderesse était responsable de l'analyse des dossiers financiers aux fins du calcul des coûts associés aux délégués externes, et de la préparation de rapports et de données d'ordre financier pour diverses personnes, dans le cadre de la préparation et de la remise de fonds en devises étrangères.
[25]
Selon la demanderesse, ces deux lettres prouvent qu'elle assumait des responsabilités plus grandes qu'elle ne l'aurait fait si elle avait été teneuse de livres ou commis à la comptabilité. Contrairement à ces dernières professions, un comptable est responsable de l'analyse et de la préparation de rapports fondés sur une analyse financière; les lettres démontrent que la demanderesse exerçait ces fonctions. Les fonctions d'un teneur de livres concernent uniquement la tenue des dossiers. Les fonctions d'un commis à la comptabilité sont aussi principalement administratives: la tenue des dossiers, et la préparation et le traitement des factures. Aucune de ces professions n'exige d'analyse et de préparation de rapports du type exigé par les emplois de la demanderesse.
[26]
Par ailleurs, la demanderesse affirme que l'agent a insuffisamment motivé sa décision. L'agent n'a pas expliqué pourquoi ou en quoi il assimile les fonctions énumérées dans les lettres d'emploi à celles d'un teneur de livres ou d'un commis à la comptabilité. Il a conclu que la demanderesse n'exerçait pas les fonctions essentielles ou plusieurs fonctions principales de la profession, sans préciser quelles sont les fonctions essentielles et quelles sont les fonctions principales au sens de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 14. La demanderesse affirme que l'analyse de la Cour dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 42, s'applique en l'espèce. Dans cette affaire, la Cour a jugé qu' « [i] l est impossible d'évaluer la conclusion de l'agente selon laquelle le demandeur n'avait pas exécuté une partie appréciable des fonctions principales décrites dans la CNP 6212, sans savoir quelles fonctions l'agente croyait qu'il n'avait pas exercées, et pourquoi ».
Défendeur
Équité procédurale
[27]
Le défendeur fait valoir que l'agent n'était pas tenu en l'espèce de faire d'autres demandes de renseignements au sujet de l'expérience professionnelle de la demanderesse. Dans le contexte d'une demande dans la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés, l'expérience professionnelle pertinente est une préoccupation directement liée aux exigences de la Loi et du Règlement. Un agent des visas n'est pas tenu de mentionner au demandeur ses préoccupations concernant cette expérience professionnelle:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). De manière plus générale, l'omission d'un demandeur de fournir des éléments de preuve satisfaisants, suffisants ou crédibles à l'appui d'une demande de visa n'entraîne pas l'obligation de l'agent d'informer le demandeur des préoccupations relatives à la suffisance ou à la crédibilité des éléments de preuve fournis: décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 26, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 12, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 24, précitées.
[28]
La jurisprudence citée par la demanderesse concerne la crédibilité, qui n'est pas en cause en l'espèce. L'agent n'avait pas de réserves particulières à l'égard des éléments de preuve. Par contre, il n'était pas convaincu, sur le fondement de l'ensemble des éléments de preuve, que la demanderesse avait exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions décrites dans la CNP 1111. Essentiellement, la demanderesse soutient que chaque fois qu'une demande est refusée en raison d'éléments de preuve insuffisants ou insatisfaisants, la crédibilité est en cause, mais la Cour a rejetée cette prétention:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 22 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
Dans la même veine, une obligation d'équité procédurale ne surgit pas chaque fois que l'agent a des réserves que le demandeur ne pouvait raisonnablement pas avoir prévues. Au contraire, « [i]l revient aux demandeurs de présenter des demandes qui sont convaincantes et qui prévoient les inférences défavorables qui peuvent être tirées des éléments de preuve et des conditions locales et de répondre à celles-ci »:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 52. En l'espèce, le défendeur affirme que la demanderesse n'a tout simplement pas assemblé une preuve assez convaincante pour étayer qu'elle avait l'expérience professionnelle requise.
Caractère raisonnable de la décision
[30]
Le défendeur allègue qu'il incombe à la demanderesse de présenter [traduction] « la meilleure preuve possible ». En l'espèce, la demanderesse n'a pas satisfait au critère établi par le régime législatif; elle n'a pas convaincu l'agent qu'elle avait une expérience de travail en tant que comptable:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 24; décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 9. Cette conclusion s'inscrit parfaitement dans les issues possibles acceptables.
[31]
Ni l'affirmation ni les lettres d'emploi de la demanderesse n'ont suffi à établir qu'elle exerçait les fonctions décrites dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la CNP 1111. En outre, la demanderesse n'a pas fourni suffisamment d'éléments de preuve pour étayer qu'elle exerçait les fonctions essentielles et une partie appréciable des fonctions principales décrites dans la CNP. Son diplôme et son titre d'emploi ne permettent pas d'établir son expérience de travail en tant que comptable: décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 22. Un agent des visas n'est pas tenu de faire des suppositions sur l'expérience de travail d'un demandeur:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[32]
Même si un demandeur n'est pas tenu d'avoir exercé toutes les fonctions principales énoncées dans la description de la CNP, il doit en avoir exercé quelques-unes - c'est-à-dire, plus d'une. Le rôle d'un agent des visas consiste à déterminer le caractère véritable du travail exercé:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), citant
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CF 1re inst).
ANALYSE
[33]
Je suis d'avis que l'équité procédurale n'est pas en cause en l'espèce. L'agent n'avait aucun doute concernant la crédibilité de la demanderesse ou l'exactitude et l'authenticité des renseignements et des documents fournis. Rien n'indique que l'agent a mis en doute la véracité des lettres; simplement, il a jugé que les fonctions qui y étaient décrites ne permettaient pas d'assimiler la profession de la demanderesse à la définition de « comptable » de la CNP 1111. La question était de savoir si la demanderesse satisfaisait aux exigences législatives et de la jurisprudence, ce qui, selon les précédents de la Cour, ne soulève aucune question d'équité procédurale. Voir, par exemple, le récent résumé de l'état du droit de la juge Kane dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et la récente analyse du juge Scott dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> précitée, aux paragraphes 26 à 29.
[34]
En outre, je suis d'avis que l'insuffisance des motifs n'est pas en cause en l'espèce. Comme l'indique très bien la décision de l'agent (qui comprend les notes consignées dans le SMGC), la demande a été refusée parce que les éléments de preuve fournis par la demanderesse [traduction] « ne suffisent pas à établir qu['elle] a exercé les fonctions décrites dans l'énoncé principal de la profession, établi dans la CNP [...] », ou qu'elle a [traduction] « exercé toutes les fonctions essentielles et une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énoncées dans la description de la CNP ». De l'avis de l'agent, [traduction] « les fonctions décrites dans [les] lettres d'emploi ne correspondent pas aux descriptions de la CNP ». Ces motifs sont tout à fait transparents et intelligibles au sens de l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (paragraphe 47), précité, et de l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . La seule question consiste à savoir si la décision était raisonnable.
[35]
La demanderesse fait valoir que ses études et son titre d'emploi prouvent qu'elle exerçait des fonctions de comptabilité. Cependant, les diplômes et titres d'emploi ne sont pas des éléments de preuve permettant d'étayer l'exercice de fonctions précises. Ainsi, dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le juge Mosley a souligné ce qui suit au paragraphe 22:
En l'occurrence, l'agent ne disposait d'aucune preuve établissant que le demandeur avait rempli l'une des fonctions requises pour satisfaire à la classification professionnelle.
Il ne suffit pas aux demandeurs d'établir qu'ils sont titulaires d'un certificat d'études, et qu'ils ont un titre d'emploi auquel la correspondance qui leur est destinée fait mention. Ils doivent fournir la preuve qu'ils ont réellement exercé « une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession
». En l'espèce, le demandeur ne l'a pas fait, ni par le biais de l'attestation de l'employeur ni par celui d'autres documents. Les renseignements fournis n'étaient pas suffisants pour constituer une preuve
prima facie
, comme il le soutient.
[Non souligné dans l'original.]
[36]
L'énoncé principal de la CNP 1111 concernant les vérificateurs et les comptables indique que « [l]es comptables planifient, organisent et administrent des systèmes de comptabilité pour des particuliers ou des entreprises ». Les fonctions décrites dans la CNP 1111 comprennent notamment:
• concevoir, mettre en œuvre et administrer des systèmes comptables et préparer des renseignements financiers pour des particuliers, des services à l'intérieur d'entreprises, de sociétés ou d'autres genres d'établissements;
• examiner les livres comptables, et préparer les états financiers et les rapports;
• concevoir et appliquer des méthodes d'établissement et de comptabilisation du coût de revient et des procédures de contrôle interne;
• examiner les états et les comptes financiers et préparer les déclarations de revenus;
• analyser les états financiers et les rapports et donner des conseils dans le domaine financier ou fiscal;
• remplir, à l'occasion, des fonctions de liquidateur dans des cas de faillite;
• superviser et former, s'il y a lieu, des stagiaires comptables, d'autres comptables ou des techniciens en administration.
[37]
À mon avis, rien dans les lettres d'emploi soumises à l'agent ne permet de penser que la demanderesse a eu pour fonction de planifier ou de concevoir des systèmes comptables pour ses employeurs. Les lettres tendent à indiquer que les fonctions de la demanderesse se limitaient à la compilation de relevés et de rapports, au calcul des profits et des pertes, à la préparation de rapports et de données d'ordre financier et au calcul et au versement des frais associés aux délégués externes. La demanderesse exerçait certaines fonctions qui relèvent de la description de la profession de comptable, au sens de la CNP 1111, mais elle faisait également des choses que fait un teneur de livres, au sens de la CNP 1231, ou un commis à la comptabilité, au sens de la CNP 1431. Donc, la difficulté pour l'agent consistait à déterminer dans quelle mesure la demanderesse s'inscrit dans l'esprit de la Loi et du Règlement. Comme la Cour l'a souligné dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 10:
Le rôle de l'agente des visas consiste en fait à déterminer le caractère véritable du travail exercé par le demandeur. L'exécution indirecte d'une ou plusieurs fonctions d'une ou plusieurs catégories d'emploi ne fait pas passer l'emploi ou les fonctions d'une catégorie de la CNP à une autre.
[38]
Par conséquent, je ne peux conclure au caractère déraisonnable des conclusions de l'agent lorsqu'il affirme, dans les notes du SMGC, ne pas être convaincu, [traduction] « sur la base des descriptions fournies dans les lettres d'emploi, », que la demanderesse [traduction] « exerçait une partie appréciable des fonctions décrites dans la CNP 1111 ». De toute évidence, on peut être en désaccord avec cette conclusion, mais je ne peux affirmer qu'elle n'appartient pas aux issues décrites dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité. Dans une certaine mesure, la demanderesse faisait certaines choses que pourrait faire un comptable de temps à autre, mais cela ne signifie pas que le caractère véritable du travail qu'elle effectuait correspondait la description de la CNP 1111.
[39]
La demanderesse reconnaît, par exemple, que les points 1 et 3 de la lettre d'Hafez Karan Sehat sont des fonctions qui pourraient tout aussi bien être exercées par un teneur le livres ou un commis à la comptabilité. Elle affirme cependant que le point 2 de cette même lettre est ce qui lui permet de s'élever au niveau de la profession de comptable, et de se qualifier au titre de la CNP 1111:
[traduction] - l'analyse des projets proposés et le calcul des profits et des pertes, ainsi que la communication de ces informations au directeur général pour qu'il prenne des décisions[.]
[40]
Selon elle, cela équivaut à l'une des « fonctions principales » décrites dans la CNP 1111:
analyser les états financiers et les rapports et donner des conseils dans le domaine financier ou fiscal[.]
[41]
Je reconnais que les deux énoncés concernent l'analyse, mais, sans plus de renseignements, il est tout simplement impossible de procéder à une comparaison valable. En tout état de cause, je ne crois pas que ce genre de chevauchement suffise à justifier que l'on considère que l'expérience de la demanderesse correspond, de par son caractère véritable, à celle d'un comptable. Plus précisément, je ne crois pas qu'il suffit d'affirmer que la décision de l'agent n'appartient pas aux issues décrites dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, pour en faire une décision déraisonnable.
[42]
Les avocats conviennent qu'il n'y a aucune question à certifier, et la Cour est du même avis.
