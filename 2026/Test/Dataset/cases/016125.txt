McKeown, J.
: The plaintiff, Mr. Del Zotto, brings two motions. One is to amend the statement of claim pursuant to rule 420. The second is to require the defendant to perform a new search for documents which may be relevant to issues in this action and requiring the defence to produce a new Affidavit of Documents reflecting the results of that search, including the full list of all documents which are relevant but which have been lost or destroyed and/or are privileged pursuant to rule 448. The applicant, Mr. Noble, also brings two motions. One is seeking to convert the application for judicial review into an action pursuant to s. 18.4 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended. The second motion, which is contingent on the success of the first, is for the consolidation of the two actions.
[2]
Both the plaintiff and the applicant have undertaken that, if these motions are granted, the moving parties will request no change to my procedural orders made on September 21, 1995. The trial will proceed as scheduled on September 3, 1996, and both the action and the application for judicial review or, if converted into an action, both actions will be ready to proceed by April 15, 1996.
[3]
I will deal with the plaintiff's motion to amend the statement of claim first. In order to review the proposed amendments, a brief review of this action and Mr. Noble's application is required. After the inquiry was set up under s. 231.4 of the
Income Tax Act
(Canada), S.C. 1986, c. 6, s. 121, the applicant, Mr. Noble, was subpoenaed on April 21, 1993. Two weeks later he issued an originating notice of motion requesting a stay of the proceedings and an application to quash the subpoena. The two grounds are set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the originating notice of motion which read as follows:
"3. Section 231.4 of the
Income Tax Act
(Canada), which is the statutory basis for the issuance of the said subpoena, is contrary to sections 7 and 8 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and, therefore, of no force or effect, in that it authorizes unreasonable searches and seizures and purports to authorize the state to compel citizens to furnish potentially incriminating evidence against themselves;
"4. In any event, even if section 231.4 of the
Income Tax Act
(Canada) is not per se and in its entirety constitutionally invalid, its operation in the particular circumstances relating to the state's attempt to compel the Applicant to testify at the said inquiry is constitutionally invalid;"
[4]
It may be seen from these two paragraphs that Mr. Noble was attacking both the constitutional validity of s. 231.4 in a general sense and in its application in this specific inquiry. Mr. Del Zotto then issued a statement of claim on August 17, 1993 against the same three parties who were the respondents in Mr. Noble's motion, i.e., Minister of National Revenue, John Edward Thompson and D. Reilly Watson, and added a fourth party, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. In the claim, inter alia, he sought in paragraph 20(c) a declaration that s. 231.4 of the
Income Tax Act
is contrary to ss. 7 and 8 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
(the
Charter
), is not justified by s. 1 of the
Charter
, and thus is of no force and effect. Additionally Mr. Del Zotto sought in paragraph 20(d) a declaration that s. 5 of the
Canada Evidence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, is contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
, is not justified by s. 1 of the
Charter
, and thus, is of no force and effect.
[5]
The applicant and the plaintiff then sought an order from the Associate Senior Prothonotary for consolidation of the judicial review matter and the action. At the same time, the Crown brought a motion seeking to strike out Mr. Del Zotto's claim against the Minister of National Revenue. The Associate Senior Prothonotary refused to permit consolidation on January 9, 1995. The Associate Senior Prothonotary stated with respect to consolidation:
"With regard to the matter of consolidation, there is no provision in the rules of this court for consolidation of actions and consolidation has frequently been refused. The court has very seldom taken advantage of rules to analogize to provincial rules allowing consolidation. In addition, the proceedings sought to be consolidated here are not both actions. One was commenced with a statement of claim and the other by a notice of motion. The parties are not identical. It is my view that consolidation should not be ordered. A single point of law will determine both proceedings so there is obviously an advantage that the matters be determined by the same Judge. This court has frequently ordered cases to be tried together or one after the other, as the judge at trial may determine. Because of the single point of law and the single investigation involved, it might have simplified matters to stay one proceeding and allow the moving party in the stayed proceeding to intervene in the continuing proceeding. Thus all would have had input in the same proceeding in the decision as to constitutionality. That relief was not asked for and cannot be granted in this motion. It may well be that consolidation as such having been refused, the parties will be able by agreement to find a way of simplifying proceedings, which presumably will be further complicated by s. 57 of the
Federal Court Act
."
[6]
He dismissed the motion for consolidation and stated:
"... It is ordered that this matter be heard together with file  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the parties may, on consent of all of the parties to both proceedings, move to stay this proceeding or the
Noble
proceeding and for an order granting the prosecuting party in the stayed proceeding the right to intervene in the other proceeding with leave to present argument on the constitutional issue ..."
[7]
Also on January 9, 1995, the Associate Senior Prothonotary granted the motion to strike the claim as against the Minister of National Revenue. He stated at page 2 of his reasons:
"No claim is made against the Minister of National Revenue. While it might be that if he had not been made a party he could have sought successfully to be added as either a defendant or an intervenor because some interest of his was in issue. Even if an interest of the Minister is in issue here, he has not sought to intervene to protect his interest. In fact he has sought to be removed from the action. Because the plaintiff makes no claim against the Minister and the Minister does not seek to be involved in the action, the Minister will be removed as a party."
[8]
On November 26, 1993, I stayed the order of the Tax Court which purported to appoint D. Reilly Watson as hearing officer for an inquiry into the affairs of Angelo Del Zotto and also restrained D. Reilly Watson from acting as hearing officer at the inquiry and John Edward Thompson from conducting the inquiry until 30 days after the final determination of the Noble and Del Zotto proceedings.
[9]
It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the specific inquiry was already being attacked by reason of certain paragraphs in the statement of claim. I cannot accept that the paragraphs (referred to by the plaintiff) in the statement of claim amount to an attack on the specific inquiry. More importantly no remedy was sought in respect of the specific inquiry.
[10]
In the winter of 1995, the Supreme Court of Canada came out with a series of cases which made it clear that in deciding whether an inquiry was a valid inquiry, one must look at the purpose of the inquiry. At the discovery in August 1995 counsel for the respondent refused to permit his client(s) to respond to questions which related to the specific purpose of this inquiry. It is because of counsel's refusal to allow these questions that the applicant now seeks to have the statement of claim amended. Normally, amendments which are necessary for the purpose of determining the real questioning controversy between the parties are allowed. Rule 420 reads as follows:
"420(1) The Court may, on such terms, if any, as seem just, at any stage of an action, allow a party to amend his pleadings, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question or questions in controversy between the parties.
"(2) No amendment shall be allowed under this rule
(a) except upon terms designated to protect all parties so far as discovery and preparation for trial are concerned; and
(b) during or after trial, except to make the pleadings accord with the issues on which all parties went to trial or on terms that there be a new trial, or that the other parties otherwise be given an opportunity for such discovery and preparation for trial as may be necessary to meet the new or amended allegations."
[11]
There cannot be any doubt at this stage of the proceedings that the purpose of this inquiry is one of the real questions in controversy between the parties. However, here I am faced with the situation that two of the respondents in the action and the judicial review are the same, but the third party is different. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada is the defendant in the action and the Minister of National Revenue is one of the respondents in the judicial review. This gives rise to a problem in this action since the Minister of National Revenue will be a necessary party to Mr. Del Zotto's action if in addition to the general attack on s. 231.4 of the
Income Tax Act
, the application of that section in this particular case is to be attacked. The difficulty arises because the Associate Senior Prothonotary struck the statement of claim as against the Minister of National Revenue in January, this year. The plaintiff opposed the striking out of the Minister of National Revenue but did not appeal the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision.
[12]
However, the decision of the Associate Senior Prothonotary predates the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 1; 99 W.A.C. 1; 97 C.C.C.(3d) 505, and in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 161; 36 C.R.(4th) 1; 96 C.C.C.(3d) 1. In my view, it would be unfair to the plaintiff to refuse an amendment which was designed to get at the real question in issue in this matter based on a prothonotary's decision which was made in another context without the knowledge that the purpose of the inquiry in this action would be a very important factor. I note the judgment of Cullen, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 400 where he stated:
"It is also not open to the plaintiff under rule 420 to add a defendant by way of joinder. Counsel for the plaintiff sought this relief in argument but had not filed any motion to that effect. Whether it is open to the plaintiff to move a further motion to add a party or parties by way of joinder or to bring another action is something that may be considered appropriate by the plaintiff and determined before another judge. The plaintiff is not prejudiced if it seeks these alternatives."
[13]
Counsel for the respondents argued that in addition to there being no legal basis for making the amendments, this is an amendment which cannot be made since costs cannot remove the resultant prejudice to the respondent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Décary, J.A., summarized the problem of injustice to the other party at page 9  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where he stated:
"With respect to amendments, it may be stated, as a result of the decisions of this court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the factors that a judge must take into consideration in determining whether it is just, in a given case, to authorize an amendment, the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.
"As regards injustice to the other party, I cannot but adopt, as Mahoney, J.A., has done in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the following statement by Lord Esher, M.R., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at page 558:
'There is no injustice if the other side can be compensated by costs; but, if the amendment will put them into such a position that they must be injured, it ought not to be made.
and the statement immediately following:
'And the same principle was expressed, I think perhaps somewhat more clearly, by Bowen, L.J., who says that an amendment is to be allowed "whenever you can put the parties in the same position for the purposes of justice that they were in at the time when the slip was made".
'To apply that rule to the present case; if the amendment is allowed now, will the plaintiff be in the same position as if the defendants had pleaded correctly in the first instance?'" (footnotes omitted)
[14]
He then quotes from Bowman, T.C.J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Tax C.C.) at p. 12:
"... I prefer to put the matter on a broader basis: whether it is more consonant with the interests of justice that the withdrawal or amendment be permitted or that it be denied. The tests mentioned in cases in other courts are of course helpful but other factors should also be emphasized, including the timeliness of the motion to amend or withdraw, the extent to which the proposed amendments would delay the expeditious trial of the matter, the extent to which a position taken originally by one party has led another party to follow a course of action in the litigation which it would be difficult or impossible to alter and whether the amendments sought will facilitate the court's consideration of the true substance of the dispute on its merits. No single factor predominates nor is its presence or absence necessarily determinative. All must be assigned their proper weight in the context of the particular case. Ultimately it boils down to a consideration of simple fairness, common sense and the interest that the courts have that justice be done."
[15]
Although costs could not remedy the unfairness to Her Majesty the Queen in this case, in my view, a limited removal of the stay with respect to the inquiry would be an adequate solution to the injustice faced by Her Majesty the Queen with an amendment at this stage. This limited lifting of the stay will fully protect Mr. Noble and offers protection to Mr. Del Zotto from any form of self-incrimination. I recognize there is a danger that proceeding with the inquiry could end up being a form of discovery against an accused. The plaintiff has had this action stayed for nearly two years and the public interest as represented by the defendant requires that the matter be proceeded with expeditiously. Although all the parties have proceeded in good faith the proceedings have been made more procedurally complex by the failure of the plaintiff and the applicant to proceed on identical basis. As a result of this failure, the defendants and respondents are faced with an injustice not compensable by costs if this amendment is allowed. The stay will be removed against the order of the Tax Court and the restraint is lifted against D. Reilly Watson from acting as hearing officer and John Edward Thompson from conducting the inquiry except that neither Messrs. Noble or Del Zotto may be subpoenaed or otherwise required to provide evidence until thirty (30) days after this action is determined or settled on consent. The schedule as drawn up two weeks ago will be adhered to notwithstanding the amendments. Her Majesty the Queen is still entitled to have the action proceed on an expedited basis on September 3, 1996, as is provided in my order dated September 21, 1995.
[16]
Before determining the extent of the amendments that are to be allowed, I must consider the respondent's argument with respect to the proposed amendments to paragraph 15 of the statement of claim. As it is legal argument, I am in agreement with the respondent that such argument cannot be included in a statement of claim and therefore, the two paragraphs that were sought to be added to paragraph 15 shall be deleted. Otherwise the remaining amendments are permitted.
[17]
I now turn to the issue of the Noble motion wherein Mr. Noble seeks to have his application for judicial review converted into an action.
[18]
It is important to note that this originating notice of motion has been ready to be heard since the summer of 1993 but has not been heard because the Associate Senior Prothonotary, in refusing Noble's motion for consolidation, ordered the application and the action to be heard together or immediately thereafter as the trial judge may decide. The motion was brought in the fall of 1993 but a decision was not obtained until January 9, 1995. Accordingly and subsequent to that decision, the two matters were to be heard together. The Del Zotto matter was not and is not ready for trial at the present time and accordingly, this matter has not been finalized.
[19]
Section 18.4 of the
Federal Court Act
gives me discretion to convert this motion into an action. Counsel for the applicant stated that if the amendments were granted in the Del Zotto matter and this matter remained an application, Mr. Noble would not be able to rely on the evidence obtained as a result of the amendments. This could lead to inconsistent results in the two matters. Since Mr. Noble's application is not an action, he has no right to discovery and accordingly, no right to use certain documents uncovered by the plaintiff in his action. In my view, there are a number of factors in this case which favour the conversion of this application for judicial review into an action. First, the judicial review is to be heard at the same time as the Del Zotto action. Second, the trial date for the Del Zotto action will not be delayed by converting this motion into an action. Third, Mr. Noble has alleged from the start that the inquiry is invalid in this specific instance. Finally, the credibility of the representative of the Minister of National Revenue may be an important factor at the trial and if Mr. Noble is restricted to his original motion, he will not have an opportunity to explore the credibility of the representative of the respondent. As Pinard, J., stated in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), the Supreme Court of Canada has stated the importance of not having
Charter
decisions made in a factual vacuum. In Noble's case, many factual and legal issues must be considered and determined by the court, including
Charter
issues. These issues are extremely complex and are not suitable for determination on a motion supported by affidavits as opposed to viva voce evidence.
[20]
It should be noted that Mr. Noble moved promptly on this matter. When his counsel showed up at the discovery of Her Majesty the Queen's representative in August, he was refused the right to participate because his client was not a part to the Del Zotto action. Mr. Noble promptly brought this motion to remedy this situation. If Mr. Noble is permitted to convert his motion into an action, there will be no delay in reaching the trial since the schedule will be adhered to as Mr. Noble has undertaken to comply with the schedule and the conditions laid out therein.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 529 (F.C.A.),
the Federal Court of Appeal has stated that, in determining whether to convert a judicial review into an action, consideration must be given to: (1) the undesirability of multiple proceedings; (2) the desirability of avoiding unnecessary costs and delays; (3) whether the particular issues involved require an assessment of demeanour and credibility of witnesses; and (4) the need for the court to have a full grasp of all the evidence. Since the applicant has met each of these considerations to my satisfaction, I order that the judicial review be converted into an action.
[21]
I must now consider the question of the consolidation of the two actions. Rule 1715 of the
Federal Court Rules
reads as follows:
"1715(1) Two or more persons may be joined together in one action as plaintiffs or as defendants with the leave of the Court or where
(a) if separate actions were brought by or against each of them, as the case may be, some common question of law or fact would arise in all the actions; or
(b) all rights to relief claimed in the action (whether they are joint, several or alternative) are in respect of or arise out of the same fact, matter or thing.
"(2) Where the plaintiff in any action claims any relief to which any other person is entitled jointly with him, all persons so entitled shall, subject to the provisions of any Act and, unless the Court gives leave to the contrary, be made parties to the action and any of them who does not consent to being joined as a plaintiff shall, subject to any order made by the Court on an application for leave under paragraph (1), be made a defendant."
[22]
Under rule 1715 I am entitled to add the Minister of National Revenue as a party in the Del Zotto action and Her Majesty the Queen in the Noble action and I make such an order. I note that motions on the two matters have always been heard together. To date every order issued has been identical in the two cases. The two counsel for Messrs. Noble and Del Zotto work with a high degree of coordination and both are assisted by the same junior counsel. In both actions the parties seek the same relief. Mr. Noble and Mr. Del Zotto both wish to strike s. 231.4 of the
Income Tax Act
either generally or with respect to these actions and to stop the inquiry. The style of cause in the action and the originating notice of motion have been used together on the front page of recent motions. There is a similarity of facts in both cases once the actions are joined. If the actions are not joined, the result would be a full exposition of the facts in the Del Zotto action but very restrictive evidence in the Noble proceeding. It is not in the interest of justice to have different facts in the two cases. There is a basic unfairness to Mr. Noble if he is not given the right to cross-examine the Crown witnesses. The estimate of 10 remaining days of discovery is based on the two cases being consolidated. I order the two actions consolidated.
[23]
Finally, I turn to Mr. Del Zotto's motion for a new Affidavit of Documents. Rule 448 sets out the minimum requirement for Affidavits of Documents and the issues here relate to rule 448:
"(2) An affidavit of documents (Form 19) shall contain
(a) separate lists and sufficient descriptions of all documents relevant to any matter in issue that
. . . . .
(ii) are or were in the possession, power or control of the party and for which privilege is claimed,
(iii) were but are no longer in the possession, power or control of the party and for which no privilege is claimed, and"
[24]
The plaintiff alleges that there were only 15 documents disclosed in the Affidavit of Documents and that another five documents have been produced since that time. Also no documents were listed in the Schedule of lost documents and during the discoveries, it became apparent that the whole file had been destroyed in 1994. The respondent submitted that some of the new documents produced related to the
Tax Operations Manual
and were disclosed as a result of my reasons dated August 3, 1995. Again the file was destroyed prior to the time that it became apparent that the
Tax Operations Manual
was important. Accordingly, I would not require a new Affidavit of Documents save and except one which will be required as a result of the amendments which have been permitted to the statement of claim today. If there are any other categories of documents that have not been produced, this order is made without prejudice to the plaintiff bringing an application for an inclusion of a further category of documents in the Affidavit of Documents. Certain documents have been refused to the plaintiff on discovery because they were not relevant to the action as previously constituted. In light of the amendments, the respondents will have to review these refusals and produce these documents, subject, of course, to any privilege which may attach to any of the documents. I, therefore, order a further Affidavit of Documents to be produced by the respondent setting out all documents that are relevant and whether such documents are privileged. Also, any documents that have been lost or destroyed should be included in the appropriate schedule. Such Affidavit of Documents should be produced within twenty-one (21) days of this order.
Order accordingly.
