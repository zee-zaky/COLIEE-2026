Heald, D.J.
: The plaintiff Hayden Manufacturing Co. Ltd. commenced an action, by a Statement of Claim filed April 16, 1993 (amended December 1, 1993) alleging infringement by the defendant Canplas Industries Ltd. of the plaintiff's patent. The defendant filed a statement of defence and counterclaim on July 5, 1993 (amended December 7, 1993). By way of counterclaim, the defendant seeks a declaration that the plaintiff's patent is void and an order that it be expunged.
[2]
In this application, the defendant seeks summary judgment pursuant to rule 432.1 of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663, dismissing the plaintiff's patent infringement action and allowing the defendant's counterclaim. The plaintiff opposes the motion for summary judgment on the basis that there is a genuine issue for trial.
I. Background
[3]
The plaintiff, Hayden Manufacturing Co. Ltd., is a company incorporated and subsisting under the laws of British Columbia. The defendant, Canplas Industries Ltd., is a company incorporated under the laws of Ontario. The plaintiff is the owner of the Canadian Patent No. 1,267,174 (the "patent") for an invention entitled CURRENT CARRYING INLET VALVE FOR CENTRAL VACUUM SYSTEM, granted on March 27, 1990.
[4]
The invention is an inlet valve for central vacuum systems. In order to have a power head attached to the end of the vacuum hose, it used to be necessary to have the electrical cord, for the power head, extending the full length of the vacuum hose. The cord would be attached at intervals to the outside of the hose, and then would extend several feet beyond the hose such that it could be plugged into a nearby electrical outlet. This system was improved over time, however it was still necessary to plug an electrical cord into an electrical outlet near the vacuum hose inlet. The plaintiff's invention eliminates the need for the use of a separate electrical outlet, and allows for the vacuum hose and electrical plug both to be inserted into the current carrying inlet valve, which then provides electricity to the power head.
[5]
The patented invention is illustrated in the drawings below, which form part of the plaintiff's patent. [See Appendix on page 32].
[6]
The plaintiff's patent included eleven claims. The plaintiff's original statement of claim alleged infringement by the defendant of claims 2 and 3 and that the defendant had induced others to infringe claim 3. During the course of this litigation, the plaintiff realized that claims 3 and 10 were too broad, and accordingly filed a disclaimer with the patent office, pursuant to s. 48 of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4 (the "
Act
"). This provision allows a patent owner who has made a specification too broad, by mistake, accident or inadvertence and without any wilful intent to defraud or mislead the public, to make a disclaimer of such parts of the patent. Those parts of the patent that are distinguishable from the disclaimed portions still remain valid. Following the filing of the disclaimer, the plaintiff amended the statement of claim to remove any allegations concerning claim 3 of the patent. Accordingly, the only claim of the patent at issue in this action is claim 2. This claim is in relation to the component of the invention described as the face plate.
[7]
The plaintiff manufactures and sells a product under the name Supervalve, which it claims is described by the patent [see footnote 1]. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's product, a current carrying inlet valve for central vacuum systems that it sells under the name Electravalve, infringes claim 2 of the plaintiff's patent. The defendant exports to customers in the United States a package containing, as separate parts, the electrical receptacle of the inlet face plate and the remainder of the inlet face plate to which the electrical receptacle is to be attached. The package also includes instructions for attaching the two components and installing the face plate. The plaintiff thus claims that the defendant has further in-fringed claim 2 of the patent by knowingly inducing, procuring and assisting others to attach the electrical receptacle to the remainder of the inlet face plate, in such a manner that the invention covered by the claim is infringed.
[8]
The defendant asserts, in the Amended Statement of Defence, firstly that its Electravalve product does not infringe the plaintiff's patent, secondly that claim 2 of the patent is invalid, and thirdly that the patent is void in its entirety. As noted supra, in its counterclaim, the defendant (plaintiff-by-counterclaim) seeks a declaration that the plaintiff's patent is invalid and an order for expungement.
[9]
This is a motion for summary judgment, brought by the defendant, wherein it is claimed that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to infringement and the validity of the patent. Accordingly, the defendant seeks an order dismissing the plaintiff's infringement action and a judgment that the patent is invalid and an order directing its expungement. The plaintiff has not filed a cross-motion, and simply opposes the defendant's application for summary judgment on the basis that there are genuine issues to be tried and therefore the motion for summary judgment ought to be dismissed.
II. Issues
[10]
The issue on this application is whether or not the court should grant summary judgment, thereby dismissing the plaintiff's patent infringement action and granting the remedies sought in the defendant's counterclaim. In determining whether this is an appropriate case in which to grant summary judgment, the issues raised by the pleadings must be dealt with. Accordingly, the following issues must be addressed.
1. Have the activities of the defendant infringed the plaintiff's patent?
i. Does the defendant's Electravalve product have connector lugs as the term is used in Claim 2?
ii.	If so, does the defendant's activity of exporting the components constitute infringement?
2. Is the plaintiff's patent invalid in whole or in part?
i. Is claim 2 invalid on the basis of it being obvious or a non-patentable aggregation?
ii. Is the entire patent void pursuant to s. 53(1) of the
Patent Act
?
III. Analysis
[11]
Prior to embarking on an analysis of the above issues, I must first set out the principles in relation to summary judgment, which I shall then apply in determining in the context of the above issues, whether this is an appropriate case for summary judgment.
[12]
The
Federal Court Rules
pertaining to summary judgment are rules 432.1 to 432.7. Of particular significance to this application is rule 432.3 which reads as follows:
"432.3(1) Where a judge is satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence, the judge shall grant summary judgment accordingly.
"(2) Where a judge is satisfied that the only genuine issue is the amount to which the moving party is entitled, the judge may order a trial of that issue or grant summary judgment with a reference to determine the amount.
"(3) Where a judge is satisfied that the only genuine issue is a question of law, the judge may determine the question and grant summary judgment accordingly.
"(4) Where a judge decides that there is a genuine issue with respect to a claim or defence, the judge may nevertheless grant summary judgment in favour of any party, either upon an issue or generally, unless
(a) the judge is unable on the whole of the evidence to find the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact or law; or
(b) the judge considers that it would be unjust to decide the issues on the motion for summary judgment.
"(5) Where a motion for summary judgment is dismissed, either in whole or in part, a judge may order the action, or the issues in the action not disposed of by summary judgment, to proceed to trial in the usual way, but upon the request of any party, a judge may order an expedited trial under rule 327.1."
[13]
Since these rules were only introduced on January 13, 1994, limited jurisprudence has developed concerning their interpretation and application. In a recent decision, Justice Tremblay-Lamer aptly summarized the gen-eral principles to be applied, based on the relevant jurisprudence, as follows:
"1. the purpose of the provisions is to allow the court to summarily dispense with cases which ought not proceed to trial because there is no genuine issue to be tried (
Old Fish Market Restaurants Ltd. v. 1000357 Ontario Inc. et al.
);
"2. there is no determinative test (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by the trier of fact at a future trial;
"3. each case should be interpreted in reference to its own contextual framework (
Blyth
and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
"4. provincial practice rules (especially rule 20 of the Ontario
Rules
) can aid in interpretation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Collie
);
"5. this court may determine questions of fact and law on the motion for summary judgment if this can be done on the material before the court (this is broader than rule 20 of the Ontario
Rules of Civil Procedure
) (
Patrick
);
"6. on the whole of the evidence, summary judgment cannot be granted if the necessary facts cannot be found or if it would be unjust to do so ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Sears
);
"7. in the case of a serious issue with respect to credibility, the case should go to trial because the parties should be cross-examined before the trial judge (
Forde
and
Sears
). The mere existence of apparent conflict in the evidence does not preclude summary judgment; the court should take a 'hard look' at the merits and decide if there are issues of credibility to be resolved (
Stokes
)." [see footnote 2] [citations omitted]
[14]
Pursuant to rule 432.1(1), the applicant for summary judgment, in this case the defendant, is required to submit affidavit material supporting its motion. Pursuant to rule 432.2 the responding party, in this case the plaintiff, must also submit affidavit material, including specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Here the defendant relies on the following evidence: affidavits of Paul Henderson sworn September 28, 1995 and February 9, 1996, and Timothy Leier sworn February 7, 1996 and April 1, 1996; and transcripts of the cross-examination of Paul Henderson and Timothy Leier, conducted on February 21, 1996. The plaintiff has adduced the following evidence: Canadian Patent No. 1,267,174; affidavits of Theodore Hayden sworn December 7, 1995, William Westman (No. 1) sworn November 24, 1995, William Westman (No. 2) sworn November 24, 1995, Greg Whitaker sworn December 7, 1995, Ernest Hancock sworn November 6, 1995 and Patricia Dixon sworn December 6, 1995; and an excerpt from the cross-examination transcript of Greg Whitaker conducted on March 6, 1995.
[15]
I shall now turn to an analysis of the aforesaid issues, to determine in view of the evidence adduced and the surrounding law, whether this is an appropriate case in which to grant summary judgment.
1. Have The Activities Of The
Defendant Infringed The
Plaintiff's Patent?
[16]
The plaintiff has limited its assertion of infringement by the defendant to claim 2 of the patent. Accordingly, in respect of the infringement issue, it must be determined whether the defendant's Electravalve product, in particular the inlet face plate, infringes claim 2 of the plaintiff's patent. The face plate component of the plaintiff's invention is described in claim 2 of the Patent as follows:
"2. An inlet face plate for use with a current carrying inlet valve in a central vacuum system comprising:
an air suction inlet consisting of a tubular fitting element forming a female hub on one end and a male spigot on the distal end and having low voltage electrical contact elements protruding from the peripheral interior surface thereof;
an electrical receptacle contiguous to said air suction inlet and having female openings to receive an electrical plug-type connector while the
distal side provides connector lugs to facilitate securing of electrical leads
; and
a hinged door having sealing means to protect said electrical receptacle and seal said air suction inlet." (emphasis added)
[17]
Both parties agree that whether or not the defendant's Electravalve product infringes claim 2 depends on the definition of the term "connector lugs" and whether the defendant's device has them. Accordingly, I shall address this issue first.
i. Does The Defendant's Electravalve Product Have Connector Lugs As The Term Is Used In Claim 2?
[18]
Both parties have filed expert affidavit evidence in relation to the construction of claim 2, and in particular the definition of "connector lugs". The plaintiff relies on the opinion of Ernest Hancock ("Hancock"), a professional engineer. The defendant relies on two affidavits of Timothy Leier ("Leier"), also a professional engineer. Both experts agree that "connector lug" is not a term of art in the electrical field [see footnote 3]. However, in interpreting this term, the experts express diverse opinions.
[19]
The plaintiff's expert Hancock stated the following regarding the definition of "connector lug" in his affidavit, sworn November 6, 1995:
"16. On the basis of the foregoing, the phrase 'connector lugs for facilitating securing of electrical leads' in claim 2 simply refers to electrical connector de-vices on the 'electrical receptacle' referred to in the claim to which electrical leads (wires) are secured by mechanical pressure or solder.
"17. There are various equivalent ways by which a wire may be secured to a lug by mechanical pressure. The kind of lug identified by reference numeral 29 in the figures of '174 [the patent] is one to which a wire is secured by means of mechanical pressure exerted by a screw clamping the wire to the lug. It was also common in February, 1986 to crimp a wire to a lug, which is another way in which a wire may be secured by mechanical pressure.
"18. There is nothing in '174, that leads me to conclude that what is covered by claim 2 is limited to use of the kind of electrical connection between a wire and the electrical receptacle that is illustrated in the patent. Firstly, the meaning of the words 'connector' and 'lugs' is, according to the IEEE, broader than the particular kind of connection illustrated in '174. Second, the way in which a wire is connected to an electrical receptacle is simply a choice of design and different, functionally equivalent, ways for making such connections were common in my field in February, 1986. The important thing is that there be a secure electrical connection between the wire and a receptacle. A skilled person in my field in February, 1986 could have chosen, and would have had no difficulty in using the common design option of crimped connections at the receptacle, rather than the particular kind of connection illustrated in '174.
. . . . .
"21. There is nothing in '174 that leads me to conclude that a connection between an electrical lead and the electrical receptacle described in claim 2 must be exposed in the way that is illustrated in the figures of '174. Whether or not the connection is exposed will not affect the functioning of the inlet face plate. If a skilled person in my field in February, 1986 did not want an exposed connection at the electrical receptacle of claim 2, that person would have had available, and would have had no difficulty in using the common design option of covering the connections made at the electrical receptacle with an insulating material. Whether such a design would be used in commercial practice in February 1986, would depend upon whether the inlet face plate with receptacle was approved by the Canadian Standards Association.
"
The Defendant's Product
"22. Attached as Exhibit C is an inlet face plate for a central vacuum system that is marked ELECTRAVALVE and was provided to me by Smart & Biggar. I have compared Exhibit D to the contents of a package that was shown to me and which was marked 'Ex. 6 of P. Henderson January 16, 1995' that contains parts for an inlet valve for a central vacuum system. Exhibit C appears to me to be identical to the inlet face plate in the aforementioned Exhibit 6 except that, in Exhibit 6, the electrical receptacle is not attached to the remainder of the inlet face plate as it is in Exhibit C.
"23. Exhibit C has all of the elements of claim 2 of '174 described at paragraph 9 above. In particular, Exhibit C includes an electrical receptacle that is contiguous to the air suction inlet of the inlet face plate, having female openings which would receive an electrical plug-type connector. The distal side of the electrical receptacle has 'connector lugs' within the meaning of that phrase in claim 2, to facilitate securing of electrical leads. The connector lugs are hidden beneath an insulating plastic layer. The electrical leads are the wires extending from the inlet face plate in Exhibit C." [see footnote 4]
[20]
The expert opinion of Hancock is that the term connector lug simply refers to an electrical connector device on the electrical receptacle to which electrical leads are secured by either mechanical pressure or solder. In his opinion, the defendant's device has connector lugs within the meaning of claim 2, to facilitate securing of electrical leads, which are hidden beneath an insulating plastic layer. Accordingly, if one accepts the definition of connector lugs expressed by Hancock, it would seem the defendant's device infringes claim 2 of the plaintiff's patent.
[21]
The defendant's expert Leier stated the following regarding the definition of "connector lug" in his affidavit sworn February 7, 1996 (No. 1):
"20. Based on the foregoing I cannot agree with the comments in Hancock' [sic] affidavit where he states that the term connector lug means any type of soldered or press fit connection. In my opinion the use of the term 'lug' is both specific and deliberate, and to a person skilled in the art, reading the '174 patent, means a projecting metal part to which a connection can be made. In the electrical field, as noted in the Canadian
Electrical Code
extracts of exhibit 'B' where any type of electrical connection is intended or permitted the term used is 'connector'; it is not specified to any greater extent. This
Code
requirement has remained unchanged since at least 1982. The specification of 'connector lugs' in the patent is contradictory to standard industry usage for general connections and therefore would not indicate a general connection as stated by Hancock.
"21. There is nothing in the '174 patent description, drawings or claims to indicate that the inventor intended to cover all types of electrical connections. If that were the case the common general term 'connector' would have been used somewhere. Instead, the only term the inventor used in the introduction section of the '174 patent, in the summary of the invention, in the detailed description and in the claim in suit is the term 'connector lug'. There is no suggestion in the patent that the term 'connector lugs' should be interpreted or rewritten as a generic term referring to any type of connector or connection.
"22. That the term 'connector lugs' means a projection according to the invention is confirmed by the inclusion of an integral wiring compartment as part of the invention. Lug type open or exposed mechanical connections on receptacles are, under s. 26-700(6) of the CSA Canadian
Electrical Code
(pages 212, 213), required to be properly protected to prevent someone inadvertently touching them. These code requirements have been in force since at least 1982. A copy of pages from the 1990 codes are attached as exhibit 'D'.
. . . . .
"26. The use of connector lugs is also confirmed by the drawings, which disclose the house wiring extending through a conduit, through the wiring compartment and connecting to the 'connector lugs'. This clearly shows why a projecting 'lug' is required, because the patent teaches and shows a need for an easy attachment point for the household wiring. In my view, the inventor never intended to cover any connections other than such 'lug' type connections.
"27. The Canplas ELECTRAVALVE product, disclosed in the Hancock affidavit, does not have connector lugs as described, shown in the drawings and claimed in the '174 patent. Quite simply there is no connector lug on the Canplas female plug. There is only the plug, and the wire integrally molded onto the plug. I have reviewed the photograph of Exhibit 'D', in which the Canplas plug has been cut apart to reveal an electrical component inside, which forms the female socket. The electrical component is a barrel connector. In my opinion, a barrel connector is not a 'lug' connector and I can find no example of it being called such in any references." [see footnote 5]
[22]
Thus, Leier expresses a much narrower definition of "connector lug" as used in claim 2, and is of the opinion that the patent was not intended to cover any connections other than the "lug" type connection illustrated in the drawings (see figures 1 and 2 above). He takes the position that the defendant's Electravalve product does not have connector lugs as claimed in the plaintiff's patent. Accordingly, if one accepts the opinion of the defendant's expert, then it seems the defendant's device does not infringe claim 2 of the patent.
[23]
It is thus apparent from the above that there is conflicting expert evidence before the court in relation to the construction of claim 2 of the patent. Although that does not necessarily preclude the matter from being dealt with on summary judgment, I am of the view that in some circumstances it may lead to that result.
[24]
The defendant submits that the plaintiff's expert evidence is, "either as a result of his lack of knowledge, or as a result of his apparent bias, unreliable and should be discarded." [See footnote 6] The defendant also submitted that parts of the plaintiff's expert's opinion were "clearly wrong" and that his "behaviour shows a certain lack of objectivity." [See footnote 7] Although the defendant never submitted that Hancock was dishonest, the defendant made allegations attacking the foundation of his opinion as well as his objectivity. In my view these allegations clearly attack the credibility of the plaintiff's expert. Thus, the defendant has put the credibility of the plaintiff's expert witness in issue.
[25]
The plaintiff also made submissions that attacked the credibility of the defendant's expert Leier. Plaintiff's counsel submitted that with respect to the connector lug issue, the defendant's expert made statements on his cross-examination that could be construed as contradicting the statements contained in his affidavit and earlier statements made in his cross-examination [see footnote 8]. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted at the hearing "that in the end the defendant's witness finally agreed that connector lug includes the kind of connector which is found in the defendant's electrical receptacle, the only difference being that in the end he said, 'Well, that's not a connector lug, that's a lug connector.'" [See footnote 9] When asked by the court whether there was a difference between the two, plaintiff's counsel replied, "I don't believe there is." [See footnote 10] In his reply, defendant's counsel argued vigorously that a connector lug and a lug connector were indeed different [see footnote 11].
[26]
This disagreement between the parties and their experts as to what is a connector lug and whether it is the same as a lug connector exemplifies my concern about granting summary judgment when the court is faced with contradictory expert opinion, and has not had the benefit of viva voce evidence. I would not be justified in accepting the plaintiff's counsel's submission that there is no difference between a connector lug and a lug connector. Likewise I would not be justified in accepting the defendant's counsel's submission that they are different. Although undoubtedly well informed, counsel have not been qualified as experts on such matters. Accordingly, I am only willing to accept their submissions if they are supported by the evidence relied on. Unfortunately, I am not assisted by the totality of the parties' expert evidence, since, in my view it is far from clear relative to this issue. Although Leier stated on cross-examination that a lug connector is not the same as a connector lug [see footnote 12], he also stated in his affidavit that "a connector lug means a specific type of connector, namely a lug type connector" [see footnote 13]. I consider this evidence to be equivocal. Furthermore, the evidence of the plaintiff's expert Hancock indicates that, in his view, a connector lug and lug connector are one and the same [see footnote 14].
[27]
In the case at bar, the court would be better served by hearing the opinions of these experts viva voce, rather than listening to opposing counsel attempt to explain what the experts meant by the statements contained in their affidavits and the cross-examination thereon. Both parties agree that the "connector lug" issue is central to the determination of this action [see footnote 15]. Accordingly, since the determination of the "connector lug" issue is of such importance, and since the evidence before the court on that issue is contradictory, this is clearly a case where the credibility of that evidence should be tested through viva voce testimony and cross-examination thereon. For these reasons I conclude that there is a genuine issue to be tried in this case which cannot be properly disposed of in a summary judgment proceeding.
ii. If The Defendant's Product Has Connector Lugs, Does The Defendant's Activity Of Exporting The Components Constitute Infringement?
[28]
Because I have concluded supra that a determination of the connector lug issue was not appropriate on summary judgment, the question of whether the defendant's export activity constitutes infringement does not arise. Furthermore, I agree with the plaintiff's counsel that it would not be proper to sever this issue, as it relies on the connector lug issue for its factual underpinning. Accordingly, I am of the view this issue should not be resolved on summary judgment.
2. Is The Plaintiff's Patent
Invalid In Whole Or In Part?
[29]
The defendant has submitted that claim 2 of the patent is invalid on the basis it was obvious and/or a non-patentable aggregation. However, the defendant has also attacked the validity of the entire patent, as a result of alleged wilful overclaiming contrary to s. 53(1) of the
Act
. On this basis, the defendant seeks an order directing expungement of the patent. Accordingly, I shall deal with each of these submissions in turn.
i. Is Claim 2 Invalid On The Basis Of It Being Obvious Or A Non-Patentable Aggregation?
[30]
In light of my conclusion above in relation to the "connector lug" issue, it is not necessary to embark on an analysis of the potential invalidity of claim 2 due to obviousness or because it is a non-patentable aggregation. I have this view because the defendant's submissions in relation to the invalidity of claim 2 are dependant upon a prior determination of the connector lug issue. The defendant submitted, in its Memorandum of Fact and Law, the following:
"If, as the inventor and the plaintiff's expert have asserted, the patent is really directed to the combination of an electrical receptacle and an air inlet, however that is achieved (that is, without regard to the structure of the inlet valve, the wiring, connectors and the wiring compartment), then the invention is obvious." [See footnote 16]
Thus, the defendant's position is that if the definition of connector lug expressed by the plaintiff's expert is accepted, then the invention requires no inventiveness and is obvious. Therefore, this submission is premised on a previous determination of the connector lug issue.
[31]
In addition, the defendant relies on prior art, in the form of several patents, to support its submission that the plaintiff's invention is obvious [see footnote 17]. However, before the plaintiff's invention can be compared to prior art, the proper construction of claim 2 would have to be determined, thus requiring resolution of the connector lug issue [see footnote 18].
[32]
Similarly, the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's invention is a non-patentable aggregation could only succeed if the court were to firstly accept the plaintiff's expert's opinion as to the definition of a connector lug.
[33]
It is therefore apparent that a finding concerning the validity of claim 2 is dependant on a previous determination of the connector lug issue. Since I have already concluded that the connector lug issue cannot be determined on summary judgment, it follows that the validity of claim 2 cannot be determined by summary judgment either.
[34]
In relation to the question of infringement and the validity of the patent, the defendant also argued the " <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Defence" [see footnote 19]. defendant's counsel argued that if the claim is as broad as the plaintiff contends that it is, such that it encompasses the defendant's product, then the plaintiff is going to "run afoul with prior art". Alternatively, if the claim is not that broad, such that the plaintiff does not run afoul with prior art, than the claim does not cover the defendant's product and there is no infringement. That is the essence of the so called <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Defence.
[35]
However, it may be the case that the defendant's product infringes claim 2 and at the same time the plaintiff's patent may not be obvious over the prior art. Thus, the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Defence could fail. However, in order to determine if such is the case, the connector lug issue would first have to be resolved. Accordingly, I am not prepared to find for the defendant on the basis of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Defence, having not made a determination in relation to the connector lug issue.
ii. Is The Entire Patent Void Pursuant To Section 53(1) Of The Patent Act?
[36]
Section 53 of the
Act
reads as follows:
"53(1) A patent is void if any material allegation in the petition of the applicant in respect of the patent is untrue, or if the specification and drawings contain more or less than is necessary for obtaining the end for which they purport to be made, and the omission or addition is wilfully made for the purpose of misleading.
"(2) Where it appears to a court that the omission or addition referred to in subsection (1) was an involuntary error and it is proved that the patentee is entitled to the remainder of his patent, the court shall render a judgment in accordance with the facts, and shall determine the costs, and the patent shall be held valid for that part of the invention described to which the patentee is so found to be entitled."
[37]
The patent originally included the mounting plate in claims 3 and 10 and the specifications and drawings. The defendant submitted the following in the Amended statement of defence and counterclaim:
"19. The specification and drawings of the '174 Patent contain more than is necessary for obtaining the end for which they purport to be made, namely to obtain a valid patent, in that the specification claims that the subject matter of claims 3 and 10 is new which it is not, and was clearly known by the plaintiff not to be new, since the plaintiff's own activities caused it to be in [sic] public domain. This addition of claims 3 and 10 was wilfully made, contrary to s. 53(1) of the
Patent Act
, for the purpose of misleading and did in fact mislead the public and the Commissioner of Patents as to the proper scope and extent of any alleged invention made by the inventor of the '174 Patent, the existence of which is not admitted but denied.
"20. The defendant/plaintiff by counterclaim states, and the fact is, the '174 Patent is and has always been void pursuant to s. 53(1) of the
Patent Act
."
[38]
The plaintiff relies on the affidavits of Theodore Hayden, the inventor, and William Westman, an employee of the plaintiff, for the assertion that the additional information contained in the patent was not included wilfully for the purpose of misleading. The only evidence adduced by the defendant in support of its contention that the addition was wilfully made for the purpose of misleading, is the cross-examination of Hayden and Westman. It is therefore apparent that this issue hinges on the credibility of Hayden and Westman. Hayden stated the following in his affidavit, "I have never intentionally misled anyone about whether I had a right to patent a mounting plate and I did not intentionally mislead the Patent Office into issuing a patent for a mounting plate." [See footnote 20] Since a determination that the patent is void pursuant to s. 53 would require a finding that the addition of the mounting plate was wilfully made for the purpose of misleading, such a determination would depend on a finding that Hayden was not credible. I am not prepared to make such a finding in the absence of viva voce evidence.
[39]
Accordingly, I am of the view there is a genuine issue to be tried and it is not an appropriate issue to be disposed of by way of summary judgment.
IV. Conclusion
[40]
For all of the aforesaid reasons, I conclude the defendant's application for summary judgment must be dismissed. Accordingly, the parties will have to proceed to trial.
[41]
During his concluding argument, Mr. Piasetzki, counsel for the defendant raised a point of procedure. It related to his cross-examination of William K. Westman on his affidavit. On that cross-examination counsel examined the affiant on a book prepared by the affiant and entitled "
Where there is a Wall, there is a Way
." [See footnote 21] Inexplicably, the book was not marked as an exhibit to Westman's cross-examination on affidavit. At the hearing of this application, I received the book as part of the cross-examination on affidavit evidence, subject to the objection of counsel for the plaintiff. At that time, I indicated that if the admissibility of this document became important I would rule on the matter subsequently. On reflection I am not persuaded that my ruling on the admissibility of the book in question was in error. Accordingly, the book entitled "
Where there is a Wall, there is a Way
" remains as an exhibit to the cross-examination of Westman on his affidavit.
[42]
The costs of this application for summary judgment are costs in the cause.
Application dismissed.
