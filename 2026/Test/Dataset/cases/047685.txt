Richard, J.
[Translation]: The appellant has filed a de novo appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge. The judge dismissed her application for citizenship on the grounds that she does not have an adequate knowledge of one of the two official languages nor an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, as provided in ss. 5(1)(d) and (e) of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29. Furthermore, in her decision the citizenship judge held that the appellant had not presented her with any evidence as to the existence of special circumstances on account of which she could make a special recommendation to the Minister under ss. 15(1). The appellant appealed on the ground that compassionate reasons justify a special recommendation to the Minister that the requirements of s. 5(1)(d) and (e) of the
Act
be waived as to her.
[2]
The citizenship judge's decision reads as follows:
"On November 1, 1993 you appeared before me at Montréal for your citizenship application interview. At that time I found that you did not meet all the requirements of s. 5(1) of the
Citizenship Act
, in particular ss. 5(1)(d) and (e).
"Section 5(1)(d) and (e) specify that persons applying for citizenship must have an adequate knowledge of one of the two official languages and an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship if they are to be eligible for citizenship.
"At the interview you were not able to correctly answer simple questions, such as:
(1) What is your name?
(2) How long have you been in Canada?
(3) Do you work outside the house?
. . . . .
"I have also assessed your knowledge of Canada through an interpreter. You were also unable to answer such questions as:
(1) At what levels of government can you vote in Canada?
(2) Who discovered Canada?
(3) Who represents the Queen in Canada?
. . . . .
"Pursuant to s. 15(1) of the
Citizenship Act
, I have considered whether there is a basis for recommending the exercise of the discretionary powers mentioned in ss. 5(3) and (4) of the
Act
. The first of those provisions gives the Minister the power to waive on compassionate grounds any requirement respecting knowledge of one of the official languages and/or knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. Section 5(4) gives the Governor-in-Council the power to direct the Minister to grant citizenship to any person in order to alleviate cases of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.
"At the interview, I tried to find out whether special circumstances existed that could warrant such a recommendation. Since you presented me with no evidence in this regard, I have no reason to make such a recommendation to the Minister."
[3]
At her hearing in this court, with the assistance of an interpreter, the appellant did answer the questions put by the amicus curiae regarding Canada and the responsibilities and benefits conferred by citizenship. Whatever the state of her knowledge when she appeared before the citizenship judge, in this court she demonstrated that she now met the requirements of s. 5(1)(e) of the
Act
. The fact remains that she does yet meet the requirements of s. 5(1)(d) as to knowledge of one of the two official languages. She tried to answer the questions put by the amicus curiae as best she could, but I have to say that she possesses only a limited knowledge of French and no knowledge of English.
[4]
However, the evidence submitted to the court by the appellant deals primarily with compassionate factors. She submitted a psychological assessment report prepared by a psychologist, Daniel Hébert, M.Ps., who concluded that:
"Our assessment of the patient clearly showed that intellectually she suffers from significant learning difficulties. Two independent tests place her results at the level of mental backwardness. Individuals who demonstrate mental backwardness have significant difficulties mastering abstract concepts. This type of difficulty may by itself explain the patient's difficulty in acquiring a second language, which involves precisely this type of learning, namely the learning of abstract concepts.
"Finally, this type of difficulty reflected in the present results seems to be independent of the patient's wishes and related instead to her faculties."
[5]
Accordingly, the question before the court is whether the appeal can be allowed on the basis of this evidence on compassionate grounds or whether some other remedy should be sought.
[6]
The relevant provisions of the
Citizenship Act
read as follows:
"5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who
. . . . .
(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;
(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship;
. . . . .
"(3) The Minister may, in his discretion, waive on compassionate grounds,
(a) in the case of any person, the requirements of paragraph (1)(d) or (e);
. . . . .
"(4) In order to alleviate cases of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Governor-in-Council may, in his discretion, direct the Minister to grant citizenship to any person and, where such a direction is made, the Minister shall forthwith grant citizenship to the person named in the direction.
. . . . .
"14(1) An application for
(a) a grant of citizenship under subsection 5(1),
. . . . .
shall be considered by a citizenship judge who shall, within sixty days of the day the application was referred to the judge, determine whether or not the person who made the application meets the requirements of this Act and the regulations with respect to the application.
. . . . .
"(5) The Minister or the applicant may appeal to the court from the decision of the citizenship judge under subsection (2) by filing a notice of appeal in the Registry of the court within sixty days after the day on which
(a) the citizenship judge approved the application under subsection (2); or
(b) notice was mailed or otherwise given under subsection (3) with respect to the application.
"(6) A decision of the court pursuant to an appeal made under subsection (5) is, subject to section 20, final and, notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament, no appeal lies therefrom.
"15(1) Where a citizenship judge is unable to approve an application under subsection 14(2), the judge shall, before deciding not to approve it, consider whether or not to recommend an exercise of discretion under subsection 5(3) or (4) or subsection 9(2) as the circumstances may require.
. . . . .
"16 Notwithstanding section 28 of the
Federal Court Act
, the Federal Court of Appeal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine an application to review and set aside a decision made under this Act if the decision may be appealed under section 14 of this Act."
[7]
The relevant provisions of the
Federal Court Rules
read as follows:
"Rule 912 An appeal shall take the form of a new hearing and, in addition to receiving evidence, the court shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, such examination of the parties and witnesses as it deems appropriate.
. . . . .
"Rule 914 The court may in its discretion take into consideration any information whether ascertained by way of evidence under oath or affirmation or not under oath or affirmation or otherwise, and may take into consideration any such information whether received from the appellant, the respondent (if any), the citizenship judge, the Minister or the amicus curiae, provided any other party has had, in the court's opinion, full opportunity to meet it.
. . . . .
"Rule 916 The decision of the court in respect of an appeal shall be delivered in open court or, in the event that the decision, at the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, is reserved, shall be given in writing and deposited in the Registry; and any such decision, whether delivered in open court or given in writing, shall be in the form of a pronouncement, a certified copy of which shall be forwarded by the Registry to the appellant, the respondent (if any), the citizenship judge, the amicus curiae and the Minister."
[8]
Under the provisions of s. 5(3) of the
Act
the Minister may, in his discretion, waive the requirements of s. 5(1)(d) or (e) of the
Act
on compassionate grounds. Under the provisions of s. 5(4) of the
Act
the Governor-in-Council also may in his discretion direct the Minister to grant citizenship to any person, notwithstanding any other provision of the
Act
. However, I do not consider that I have the same power to direct or recommend that the Minister grant citizenship. In
Re Akins
(1978), 87 D.L.R.(3d) 93 (F.C.T.D.), at p. 96, Addy J. made a detailed analysis of the scheme of the
Act
and concluded, despite the persuasive submissions of the appellant, that he did not have the authority to order that the provisions of s. 5(1) be waived. (See a contrario
Re Khalil
(July 24, 1992), No. T-2608-91 and
Re Al-Assad
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 105 (T.D.)) This decision was followed by Strayer, J., in
Re Khat
(1991), 49 F.T.R. 252 (T.D.), at p. 253.
"Her representative strongly urged that I should make a recommendation to the Minister to exercise his discretion under s. 5(3)(a) of the
Act
to waive the requirement of such knowledge in s. 5(1)(e) on compassionate grounds. The compassionate ground pressed was that Mrs. Khat cannot acquire a better knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship because she is illiterate in Cambodian as well as in both official languages of Canada. She has made serious efforts to learn English since coming to Canada but has made only moderate progress. This is her second unsuccessful application for citizenship.
"There has been some division of opinion in this court concerning the jurisdiction of the court to make such recommendations. I respectfully agree with those judges who have found that the court has no such jurisdiction. (See e.g.,
Re Akins
(1978), 87 D.L.R. (3d) 93;
Re Boutros
, [1980] 1 F.C. 624; and
Re Aaron
, [1982] 2 F.C. 348). The appeal to this court which is authorized under subs. 14(5) is an appeal 'from the decision of the citizenship judge under subs. (2) ...', and the decision referred to in that subsection is a decision of the judge to approve or not approve the application. The power given to a citizenship judge in s. 15(1) with respect to the exercise of discretion on compassionate grounds is that of making a recommendation to the Minister in this respect. This is not a 'decision' under s. 14((2)."
[9]
However, this does not mean that the appellant has no compassionate recourse in this court. In
Re Khat
, Strayer, J., also indicated that it is possible to refer a case back to the citizenship judge if the court considers that the judge did not take relevant evidence into account: (See a contrario
Re Hui
(February 25, 1994), No. T-1843-92, at p. 12 [(1994) 75 F.T.R. 81])
"Section 14(2) provides, however, that as a precondition to making a decision under that subsection, the citizenship judge must consider whether or not to make a recommendation under s. 15(1). While it is not for this court, sitting on appeal, to review the conclusion of the citizenship judge as to whether a recommendation should be made, in a proper case it may be open to this court to refer the matter back to the citizenship judge if this court is not satisfied that relevant factors have been taken into account in the exercise of that discretion.
. . . . .
"Similarly in this case I have ordered that the matter be referred back to the citizenship judge for reconsideration as to whether the discretion under s. 15(1) should have been exercised in favour of the appellant before making the decision under s. 14(2), having particular regard to the applicant's apparent lack of ability to become literate in an official language of Canada. Because the exercise of that discretion is uniquely a matter for the citizenship judge, it is of course for her to satisfy herself from the evidence as to the inability referred to, and for her to determine whether such a factor warrants a recommendation on compassionate grounds.
"I am taking this step because it is not apparent from the reasons for the citizenship judge's decision given to the appellant, nor from those given to the Minister, that this obviously relevant factor had been taken into account. Indeed there is no indication as to what factors were taken into account. As the proper exercise of the discretion is a precondition to the exercise of the power to make a decision under s. 14(2), it is important that this court be satisfied on appeal that the discretion has in fact been exercised. It would be particularly helpful that the reasons given by the citizenship judge for refusing a favourable exercise of a discretion be indicated, at least in relation to compassionate grounds specifically urged by the applicant."
Strayer, J., referred the matter back to the citizenship judge for the evidence to be reconsidered on compassionate grounds. This remedy was also granted by Rouleau and Joyal, JJ., in
Re Hokayem
(1990), 37 F.T.R. 49 (T.D.) and
Re Ismail
(1993), 59 F.T.R. 235 (T.D.).
[10]
I concur in the reasoning of Strayer, J., I do not feel, as Muldoon, J., appears to suggest in
Re Khouri
(1991), 51 F.T.R. 76 (T.D.), that proceedings should be multiplied by requiring the appellant to file an application for judicial review under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
. Further, and pursuant to s. 16 of the
Citizenship Act
, I doubt that such a remedy is available. In my view, this court has jurisdiction to refer the matter back to the citizenship judge not only if the judge did not take relevant evidence into account, but also when relevant information was included in the record of the Federal Court at the rehearing in this court.
[11]
The appeal is allowed in respect of s. 5(1)(e), but dismissed in respect of s. 5(1)(d). However, I refer the matter back to the citizenship judge for her to take relevant information in the psychological assessment report prepared on the appellant by Daniel Hébert into account in reconsidering the evidence as to compassionate grounds mentioned in s. 5(3) of the Act.
Order accordingly.
