INTRODUCTION
[1]
Gibson, J.
: These reasons follow the hearing of an application for judicial review of a decision of a Member of the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Member") made following an admissibility hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
[see footnote 1] (the "
Act
"). The Member concluded her reasons in the following terms:
"I have concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh was a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism. Therefore, he has not satisfied me that he is not inadmissible to Canada under paragraph 34(1)(f) [of the
Act
]."
[2]
In the result, a removal order issued against the Applicant pursuant to paragraph 45(d) of the
Act
.
[3]
The decision under review is dated the 13th of February, 2003.
BACKGROUND
[4]
The background to the decision under review is succinctly set out in the reasons for decision. At page 2 and 3 of the reasons, the Member wrote:
"At the admissibility hearing on 13 January 2003, Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh and his counsel conceded that his name, date of birth and country of birth are correct as they appear in the report; i.e., that his full and correct name is Piran Ahmadi Poshteh born 26 July 1984 in France. Also, he conceded that he is not a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident of Canada, that he seeks to enter Canada in order to remain on a permanent basis, that he is not in possession of the required visa, and that he does not hold any passport or travel document whatsoever.
"Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh and his counsel further conceded that the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) is an organization in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in terrorism."
The Member continued at page 4 of her reasons in the following terms:
"Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh testified that he was not a member of the MEK although his father was. His father died in 1999 when he [the Applicant] was 15 years old, and he blames the Iranian government of his father's death. He wanted to join the MEK in order to continue to help achieve his father's goal, which he understood to be the overthrow of the current Iranian government. He testified that his love for his father was his impetus to seek membership in the MEK.
"Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh testified that his father's friend (whom he also believed to be a member of the MEK) would not allow him to join the MEK, but eventually allowed him to participate through the dissemination of propaganda. From approximately February 2000 to approximately June 2002 at a frequency of one or two times per month, he and a colleague would distribute MEK propaganda leaflets in Tehran. He ceased this activity in June 2002 because he was arrested and detained for two weeks by the police. He was too frightened after this ordeal to continue his involvement.
"Mr. Ahmadi-Poshteh testified to no other involvement in MEK activities. He testified that he did not attend meetings, or recruit members or engage in any activity whatsoever other than the distribution of propaganda. He testified that he was unaware that the MEK was considered to be a terrorist organization or that it employed violence to achieve its ends."
[5]
Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh testified that he is a citizen of Iran.
RELEVANT STATUTORY AND REGULATORY PROVISIONS
[6]
A significant number of statutory and regulatory provisions are central to this matter. For ease of reference, those provisions are set out in a schedule of these reasons.
THE DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[7]
In her reasons, the Member summarized the evidence before her with respect to the MEK. She concluded that it exists and is an organization, and that there are reasonable grounds to believe it engages, has engaged or will engage in terrorism. She considered the meaning of the word "member" by reference to the
Oxford English Dictionary
and by reference to relevant jurisprudence. She wrote:
"It [the word 'member'] is a term similar to the word 'terrorism', in that it will acquire its definition bit by bit through a growing body of case law. Jurisprudence in Canada has provided some guidance in assessing what constitutes membership. In
Baroud (Re)
the person concerned was determined to be a member of a terrorist organization for having provided his expertise in counterfeiting and forged travel documents for the benefit of Fatah and Force 17. In
Suresh
the person concerned raised funds for the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). In
Singh
the person concerned was involved in fundraising, recruiting and organizing for the benefit of the BK (Babbar Khalsa) and the BKI (Babbar Khalsa International)." (citations omitted)
[8]
The Member then went on to review at some length the Applicant's testimony regarding his motivation for seeking to ally himself with the MEK and his activities and knowledge of the MEK. She concluded:
"Based upon the foregoing and in light of any evidence to the contrary, it appears that Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh's involvement with the MEK consisted solely of disseminating propaganda for a period of approximately two years. Aside from the fact that he referred to himself as a member at one point ..., I find that his involvement with the MEK goes beyond that of a mere sympathizer or supporter. He shared in the MEK's overriding goal to overthrow the current Iranian government. Although there was no formal enlistment in the MEK, it was not for lack of trying. Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh desperately wished to enlist in some formal fashion. He claims he was denied that permission. Nevertheless, he was allowed for a period of two years to engage in an activity for the benefit of the MEK. Propaganda is an important part of the MEK. The purpose of propaganda is partly to educate, but also to enlist sympathy and support for one's cause. Support could conceivably range from funding to enlistment of new members, to creating a climate where one's activities (violent or otherwise) can proceed. Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh disseminated MEK propaganda approximately 24 to 48 times over a period of approximately two years. I find this to be a significant level of activity. I do not find it to be marginal or minimal. I am satisfied that he performed a function that is equal to that of a member of the MEK. By virtue of his activities on behalf of the MEK, he fulfilled the role of 'member' in the context of 34(1)(f) of the
Act
.
"Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh claims that he disassociated himself from any involvement with the MEK after his experience in detention. I do not find it implausible that a 17-year-old would find the reality of arrest and detention in Iran sufficiently frightening to cause him to end his association with the MEK. Nor do I conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he may re-associate himself with the MEK in Canada. I find no basis for Mr. Brian Page's observation that '(I)t is likely that he will make contact with members of this group while in Canada, and that he will actively work for their cause' [reference to an exhibit omitted] beyond mere suspicion. I attach no weight to Mr. Page's speculations. However, I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh
was
a member of an organization in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism." (emphasis in the original)
[9]
The Member then goes on to review the Applicant's testimony regarding his knowledge of MEK activities. She concludes in this regard:
"Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh denies any knowledge of terrorist acts committed by the MEK. He also denies that, prior to his arrival in Canada, he had any knowledge that the MEK is considered to be a terrorist organization. He admitted some historical knowledge of the organization including its bases in France and Iraq. He understood generally its goal to overthrow and replace the current Iranian government. However, he claims to be ignorant of any violent activities carried out by the MEK.
"I do not find Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh['s] claim that he was ignorant of violent activities carried out by the MEK to be credible. He was directly involved in propaganda activities for two years. He received his materials from the MEK via e-mail and the Internet. He would have been in receipt of material from the MEK on anywhere from 24 to 48 different occasions. While I do not doubt that much of that material was critical of the Iranian regime, I also believe that on occasion that material contained information regarding MEK activities. The
Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK or MKO)
[reference to an Exhibit omitted] list several violent actions carried out by the MEK many for which the MEK claimed responsibility. For the period of February 2000 to June 2001 ..., the MEK claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on the Presidential Palace in Tehran resulting in one death, a mortar attack on or near the Revolutionary Guard Corps ... compound in Tehran, a mortar attack on a state security building in Tehran, the attempted assassination of a Brigadier General in Tehran, a guerilla attack on the Organization of Islamic Culture and Communications in Tehran, and a rocket attack on a state-owned building in Tehran.
Patterns of Global Terrorism
... also states that the MEK 'regularly claimed responsibility for armed incursions into Iran that targeted police and military outposts, as well as for mortar and bomb attacks on security organization headquarters in various Iranian cities'.
"I believe that an organization such as the MEK that believes that violence as a means to an end is justified and that openly claims responsibility for violent acts also keeps its members and supporters apprised of its actions through its propaganda. It makes no sense that an organization that feels justified in using violence and openly claims responsibility for violent acts would not proudly proclaim those acts to its members and supporters. By the same token, I also believe that Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh understood that the overthrow of the current Iranian government would occur through violent means if necessary. It is his understanding that the present government of Iran will be removed by means of a revolution. If Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh knows anything about his own country's recent history, he knows that revolution is not without violence. Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh was eager to do anything for the MEK to avenge his father's death. I believe it mattered little to him that the MEK had engaged in acts of terror or violence." (some citations omitted)
[10]
The Member noted the Applicant's urgings that "member", in the context of paragraph 34(1)(f) of the
Act
ought to be read restrictively and so as to exclude minors such as he was throughout the time of his activity on behalf of the MEK. In response, she wrote:
"There is no distinction made in the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
and
Regulations
respecting the admissibility of minors as opposed to that of adults. Distinctions are made, however, respecting the detention of minors as opposed to the detention of adults. I conclude from this that had the legislators wished to distinguish the admissibility of minors on security grounds, they could have easily done so. In addition, I do not find Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh's argument persuasive that he is less liable for his actions given that at the time that he was actively involved with the MEK he was a minor. He became involved of his own volition. Although he may have been initially motivated by passion, he decided to continue his involvement for the next two years. He chose to become involved and he chose to leave. He was of an age where he made decisions even against the advice of the adults in his life. He is accountable for his actions and to the consequences of those actions.
I am not persuaded that a more restrictive definition of membership ought to be applied in this case
. I conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh was a member of the MEK." (emphasis added)
[11]
Finally, the Member acknowledges that her finding in respect of the Applicant precludes him from pursuing a Convention refugee claim in Canada by reason of paragraph 101(1)(f) of the
Act
. She acknowledges that, given his status as a minor at all times during his activity in relation to the MEK in Iran, to fail to grant him differential treatment might be seen to amount to a denial of fundamental justice. The Member notes sections 1 and 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[see footnote 2] (the "
Charter
") and provisions of the
Act
that provide for an application to the appropriate Minister for protection in circumstances such as those in which the Applicant now finds himself. She concludes:
"The Federal Court - Trial Division in
McAllister
noted that foreign members of terrorist organizations are inadmissible to Canada and that such a provision does not offend the
Charter
. The Supreme Court of Canada set out in
Suresh
that the Minister is obliged to exercise discretion in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice in cases where a person may face torture if he is removed from Canada. Perhaps the person's age may be a factor under consideration as well. In any event, the Minister is bound by section 7 of the
Charter
and is bound to observe the principles of fundamental justice in considering whether allowing Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh's application for protection and thus staying the removal order serve the public interest. Based upon the foregoing, I am satisfied that Mr. Ahmadi Poshteh's rights under section 7 of the
Charter
are not engaged by making a finding that he is inadmissible to Canada on security grounds." (citations omitted)
THE ISSUES
[12]
I am satisfied that the issues on this application for judicial review are the following: first, whether the Member erred in a reviewable manner in her interpretation of the word "member" as it is used in paragraph 34(1)(f) of the
Act
; secondly, whether the Member erred in a reviewable manner in determining the Applicant to be a "member" within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(f) of the
Act
; and thirdly, whether the Member erred in a reviewable manner in determining, and these are my words, not the Member's, that consideration of
Charter
issues was premature, given her mandate and its interrelationship with other steps in the administrative process that might lead to the removal of the Applicant to Iran. Each issue raises the associated question of standard of review.
ANALYSIS
1) The Interpretation of "member"
[13]
Before the Court, counsel urged that the Member erred in a reviewable manner in interpreting the word "member" without regard to her obligation under subsection 3(3) of the
Act
to construe and apply the
Act
in a manner that would ensure that her decision is consistent with the
Charter
and that complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory, here, in particular, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child [see footnote 3]. He further urged that the standard of review on the issue, against a "pragmatic and functional analysis" [see footnote 4] is "correctness".
[14]
I am satisfied that, on a fair reading of the Member's reasons for decision, this question and the related question of appropriate standard of review simply do not arise. The Member was not called upon to determine whether the word "member" in paragraph 34(1)(f) of the
Act
should be interpreted restrictively so as to exclude all minors from ever being found to be members of terrorist organizations, or more liberally, and she quite properly did not make a finding in this regard. Rather, she dealt only with the issue of whether or not the Applicant, who was a minor at all relevant times, was a "member" of a terrorist organization during the time when he engaged in Iran in activity on behalf of the MEK. The Member made no reviewable error in failing to undertake an interpretive analysis of the meaning of the word "member" as used in paragraph 34(1)(f) beyond the limits of the specific facts before her, whatever might be the appropriate standard of review in the context of such an abstract interpretation.
2) Reviewable error in determining the Applicant to fall within the ambit of paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Act
a) Standard of Review with regard to the determination of "membership" on the facts before the Member
[15]
On this issue, I adopt the analysis of my colleague Justice Lemieux in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Lemieux concluded, after referring to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  analysis" referred to in those decisions, concluded that the standard of review of the decision that was before him was reasonableness simpliciter, notwithstanding that the determination flowing from the decision that was under review was of "quite profound" significance for the Applicant before him [see footnote 7]. Justice Lemieux went on to adopt the words of Justice Iacobucci in
Director of Investigation and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or unreasonableness standard of review:
"... An unreasonable decision is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. Accordingly, a court reviewing a conclusion of the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect, if there is one, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it. An example of the former kind of defect would be an assumption that had no basis in the evidence, or that was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. An example of the latter kind of defect would be a contradiction in the premises or an invalid inference."
[16]
As a general comment, I must say that I found the reasons of the Member for the decision that is here under review to be comprehensive, fair and well reasoned.
b) Reviewable error
[17]
It was not alleged before me that the Member, in arriving at the decision she did, misapprehended the facts before her, ignored any argument made on behalf of the Applicant or was other than "alert and alive" to the fact that the Applicant was at all relevant times a minor. The Member's interpretation of the word "member" in paragraph 34(1)(f), on the facts before her, was not unreasonable and, I am satisfied, could not be said to have ignored international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory but rather to have balanced compliance with those instruments with other objectives of the
Act
as set out in subsections 3(1) and (2) and with other factors enumerated in subsection 3(3). Further, when read in the context of the evidence that was before the Member, the interpretation given by the Member to the concept of "membership" was, I am satisfied, consistent with earlier decisions of this Court.
[18]
In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  test to determine membership?" wrote at paragraphs [17] and [18] of her reasons:
"At the outset of the Appeal Division's analysis of the evidence concerning membership, the Appeal Division stated as follows:
'It would be inappropriate to construe the word "member" in section 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) of the
Act
narrowly. That is, given that the section is directed at activities which undoubtedly have a clandestine nature, "member" should not be understood to involve attributes of "membership" in recognized or legally constituted organizations, such as the paying of fees or being registered on a membership list. At the same time, the word should have a content that goes beyond that of being a mere supporter or sympathizer.' (footnote omitted)
"On a fair reading of its reasons, I cannot conclude that the Appeal Division applied an incorrect test. The Appeal Division correctly directed itself that the word 'member' must not be construed narrowly. ..."
[19]
While the foregoing quotation makes it evident on its face that Justice Dawson was dealing with provisions of the former
Immigration Act
[see footnote 10], I remain satisfied that her comments and those of the Appeal Division that she quoted are equally applicable on the facts of this matter, albeit that Justice Dawson would appear to be applying a standard of "correctness" which might well be appropriate given the generalized nature of the words of the Appeal Division that were before her. While there is nothing on the face of Justice Dawson's reasons that would indicate that the individual who was there found to be a "member" was at any relevant time a minor, in light of the fact that I am satisfied that the Member whose reasons and decision are here under review was "alert and alive" to the Applicant's age at the time of his activities, I am satisfied that is not a distinguishing factor.
3) "Prematurity"
[20]
Finally, I am satisfied that, once again against a standard of review of reasonableness, the Member's conclusion that it was, and this is my word, not hers, "premature" to entertain an argument of a
Charter
breach in light of avenues remaining open to the Applicant to have his situation reviewed given the treatment he might face if required to return to Iran, was open to her.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph [17]:
"We have been dealing here: first, with the issuance of a deportation order,
not
its actual execution to a precise country, and second, with a refusal to inquire into a claim of fear of persecution,
not
a refusal to take into consideration proof, on a balance of probabilities, that the deportee, if sent back to a particular country, will be subject to persecution including torture and possibly execution. I may have had no difficulty in finding that the rules of fundamental justice did not require, in the case of a criminal who is certified to be a public danger, thorough investigation of a claim of fear of persecution prior to the issuance of a deportation order against the person. It would be my opinion, however, that the Minister would act in direct violation of the
Charter
if he purported to execute a deportation order by forcing the individual concerned back to a country where, on the evidence, torture and possibly death will be inflicted. It would be, it seems to me, a participation in a cruel and unusual treatment within the meaning of section 12 of the
Charter
, or, at the very least, an outrage to public standards of decency, in violation of the principles of fundamental justice under section 7 of the
Charter
. There are means to enjoin the Minister not to commit an act in violation of the
Charter
."
[21]
To the same effect, see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  brief analysis, I find no reviewable error on the part of the Member in arriving at the decision that is here under review. In the result, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.
CERTIFICATION OF A QUESTION
[23]
At the close of hearing of this application for judicial review, I reserved my decision and advised counsel that, following circulation of reasons setting forth my decision, an opportunity would be provided to them to make submissions on certification of a question. Counsel for the Applicant will have seven (7) days from the date of these reasons to serve and file any submissions considered appropriate on certification of a question. Thereafter, counsel for the Respondent will have seven (7) days to serve and file any responding submissions. Finally, counsel for the Applicant will have a further three (3) days to serve and file any reply submissions. Only thereafter will an order issue on this application for judicial review.
Application dismissed.
