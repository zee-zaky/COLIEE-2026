Pinard, J.
[Translation]: The appellant EXPORT/IMPORT CLIC INC. has appealed under s. 56 of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, from the decision made on December 31, 1991 by the Chairman of the Opposition Board ("the Registrar") allowing the opposition of the respondent "Effem Foods Ltd." to the registration by the appellant of a trademark, "Uncle Tony's Crystal (& design)", the subject of application TMO 546,659.
[2]
The parties are both Canadian corporations, the appellant having its head office in Laval, Quebec, and the respondent in Bolton, Ontario. On July 25, 1985, the appellant applied under number TMO 546,659 to register the graphic trademark "Uncle Tony's Crystal (& design)" in association with wares stated to be "Italian medium grain natural rice", based upon use of the mark in Canada in association with these wares since May 1, 1985. The application for registration was accepted for publication by the Registrar and thus was published in the March 11, 1987 edition of the
Trade Marks Journal
, vol. 34, no. 1689, page 7, as reproduced below:
[3]
On August 11, 1987, having obtained an extension of time for this purpose, the respondent served a statement of opposition to the registration on the appellant. On December 30, 1987, the appellant filed a counterstatement reiterating its right to the registration for which application had been made. On September 11, 1989, the respondent filed an amended statement of opposition and on January 31, 1990, the appellant filed an amended counterstatement.
[See printed version]
[4]
In support of their respective arguments, the respondent filed the affidavit of Donald M. Robinson, and the appellant filed affidavits executed by Amine Rahal, Brian McBride, Sophie Dufresne, René Dame, Sylvain Inkel, Jean-Pierre Mondou, Michel Malette, Antoine Laplante, Daniel Lasalle, Stanely Gawrych and Milton Antypass. Written argument was exchanged before the Opposition Board and there was a viva voce hearing.
[5]
On December 31, 1991, having reserved his decision, the Registrar upheld the respondent's opposition and accordingly refused the appellant's application for registration. The Registrar's conclusion reads as follows:
"In view of the above, I find that the applicant's trademark 'Uncle Tony's Crystal & Design' is not registrable and not distinctive, and that the applicant is not the person entitled to its registration.
"I refuse the applicant's application pursuant to section 38(8) of the
Trade-marks Act
."
[6]
In the case at bar, the essential issues will be resolved by considering and determining the issue of the reasonable likelihood of confusion between the appellant's mark, "Uncle Tony's Crystal (& design)", and the respondent's mark, "Uncle Ben's". This was recognized by the appellant, and it is also clearly explained in the Registrar's decision:
"The grounds of opposition relating to the registrability and distinctiveness of the applicant's trademark, as well as the applicant's entitlement thereto, turn on the issue of confusion between the applicant's trademark 'Uncle Tony's Crystal & Design' and one, or more, of the opponent's registered trademarks. Further, the most relevant of the opponent's trademarks is its registered trademark 'Uncle Ben's', registration No. 149/38182, covering, inter alia, 'rice for food'. Accordingly, the determination of the issue of confusion between the applicant's trademark and the registered trademark 'Uncle Ben's' will effectively resolve all the issues based on the allegations of confusion set forth in the statement of opposition."
[7]
Where the issue is whether two marks create confusion, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances, including those specifically listed in s. 6(5) of the
Trade-marks Act
:
"6(5) In determining whether trademarks or tradenames are confusing, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or tradenames and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademarks or tradenames have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or tradenames in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them."
[8]
It therefore appears from this provision that the circumstances listed in paragraphs (a) to (e) are not exhaustive, since regard must be had to all the surrounding circumstances. Although each of the circumstances listed must not necessarily be given the same importance (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 486, at 494-495 (F.C.T.D.)), the degree of resemblance between the marks is in reality the most crucial factor. (see M. Chromecek,
World Intellectual Property Guidebook
: Canada
, Bender, New York, 1991, para. 6E, at p. 6-83.)
[9]
In the case at bar, it is clear that the Registrar complied with all these principles. After pointing out, citing case law in support, that the material date in the case of an opposition based on para. 12(1)(d) of the
Trade-mark Act
is the date of his decision, and that under para. 16(1)(a) of the
Act
the material date is the applicant's claimed date of first use, the Registrar correctly referred to all the relevant evidence before him.
[10]
Thus with respect, first, to inherent distinctiveness, the Registrar held that the parties' marks, when considered in their entirety, had a certain inherent distinctiveness, particularly because of the initial element "Uncle" in each mark, the elements "Ben" and "Tony", which are rather common, themselves not adding much distinctiveness. He held that the mark "Uncle Ben's" in association with rice is, if not famous, at least a very well-known mark in Canada. He indicated that the respondent's sales in Canada from 1982 to 1988 exceeded $188,000,000, while the appellant, using its mark "Uncle Tony's Crystal" in Canada, had sales exceeding $570,000.
[11]
With respect to the length of time the marks have been in use, he held that "Uncle Ben's" rice has been distributed in Canada since at least 1947, while the appellant claimed use of its own mark in Canada since May 1, 1985.
[12]
The Registrar held all the types of wares and channels of trade involved to be identical.
[13]
As for the degree of resemblance between the marks, the Registrar found that they did possess some degree of similarity in appearance when considered in their entireties as a matter of first impression and imperfect recollection. He noted that the marks include the initial element "Uncle" followed by the possessive form of a common name or nickname. The Registrar also expressed the opinion that the appellant's wares would be identified aurally by the average consumer as "Uncle Tony's" rice and that the respondent's wares would be identified as "Uncle Ben's" rice and, as such, the marks of the parties did bear some similarity when sounded. Moreover, he expressed the opinion that by suggesting a connection with an individual associated with the products the marks at issue suggest the same idea.
[14]
Finally, the Registrar considered other surrounding circumstances, inter alia the presence in the Register of the mark "Uncle Tom's", TMO 306,077, in connection with rice, as set out in the affidavit of Brian McBride, and the fact that no instance of confusion between the marks "Uncle Tony's Crystal" and "Uncle Ben's" had been reported to some eight food store managers, whose affidavits were also filed by the appellant. In the first case, the Registrar expressed the opinion that in the absence of details as to sales of products associated with the mark "Uncle Tom's" and as to the manner in which it is used, this evidence was of little value in respect of dilution of the opponent's mark "Uncle Ben's". In the second case, the Registrar seems not to have been impressed, for the reason that the affidavits did not constitute direct evidence that there was no actual confusion.
[15]
After having thus considered all the surrounding circumstances, including the circumstances specifically listed in paragraphs (a) to (e) of s. 6(5) of the
Trade-mark Act
, the Registrar stated that he was still left in doubt as to whether there would be a reasonable likelihood of confusion between the marks at issue. Accordingly, he concluded that the appellant had failed to meet the legal burden upon it in this respect and refused the application for registration made by it under s. 38(8) of the
Trade-mark Act
.
[16]
There is no doubt, in law, that in the circumstances the Registrar placed the burden of proof on the proper party, and that if he was in doubt he had to decide against the party to whose application for registration of a mark opposition had been made. This is confirmed by the decisions in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at 39, affd. (1979), 29 N.R. 361; 43 C.P.R.(2d) 271 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 359, at 365 (T.D.); and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 188 (F.C.T.D.).
[17]
At this point, it is important to note that, under s. 56(5) of the
Trade-mark Act
, the appellant produced to this court evidence in addition to the evidence filed before the Registrar: the affidavits of Frank Dufour and Gilles Lebrecque. These deponents were not cross-examined by the respondent, which, moreover, did not itself file additional evidence.
[18]
Although it is recognized in principle that a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks must be given consideration and not be lightly set aside, I am well aware that this does not amount to relieving me, as the judge who hears the appeal from that decision, of the responsibility of determining the issues, having regard to all the relevant circumstances. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 148 (F.C.T.D.), affd. (1982), 60 C.P.R.(2d) 70 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  evidence before this court, I can legally "exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar".
[19]
This being said, after considering all the evidence before this court, I cannot decide otherwise in fact and in law, with respect to the essential points, than the Registrar has so well decided. I therefore adopt his considerations and his conclusions, which I examined earlier. One slight reservation is necessary, however, in respect of the evidence of the absence of actual confusion found in the affidavits of some eight food store managers; while this evidence does not seem to have impressed the Registrar because it was not "direct evidence", I myself am no more impressed, but this is rather because of the fact that the appellant sells its product through more than 650 commercial establishments in Canada, and because in the circumstances the very limited sampling of reports made by a mere eight managers of these stores can, in the absence of scientific evidence, have only insignificant probative force. However, this reservation does not alter the result I have reached, which is the same as the result reached by the Registrar.
[20]
I therefore believe that the additional evidence submitted to this court by the appellant for the purpose of establishing what is in the Register and pointing out the difference between the parties' products is not such as would permit me to reach a different conclusion.
[21]
With respect to the Register, the affidavit of Frank Dufour notes that there are 32 marks in it which contain the elements "Uncle" and a given name or diminutive. Although eight of these marks relate to food products, and ten others to restaurant services, only one of them, apart of course from the respondent's mark "Uncle Ben's", is registered in association with rice: the mark "Uncle Tom's" to which I referred earlier. As in the case of that mark, the evidence supplied no details as to sales of products associated with these other marks and the manner in which they are used. Thus what is in the Register is of little importance with respect to dilution of the opponent's mark "Uncle Ben's".
[22]
With respect to the additional evidence introduced in order to point out the difference between the parties' products, the distinctions made still relate to a specific product which is nonetheless the same: rice. The fact that these distinctions, which relate, inter alia, to the size of the rice and its suitability for exotic dishes, may have particular significance to food and agricultural writers, as the deponent Labrecque appears to be saying, is not conclusive for the purposes of this case. The real test in this instance requires, first, that we put ourselves in the situation of a consumer who has an imperfect recollection of a mark and who subsequently sees the other mark, and that we ask ourselves whether there is then a likelihood that this consumer's first impression will be that the latter mark comes from the same source as the former. (See R.T. Hughes,
Hughes on Trademarks
, Butterworths, Toronto, 1984, para. § 61, at p. 621;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 196, and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 46, at 53 (T.D.). See also M. Chromecek,
World Intellectual Property Guidebook
: Canada
, supra, at page 6-81.) Thus there is also nothing in the specific circumstances comprised by the distinctions pointed out in the Labrecque affidavit, when taken together with all of the circumstances established by the rest of the evidence as a whole, on which I could make any decision other than that made by the Registrar.
[23]
For all these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed, with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
