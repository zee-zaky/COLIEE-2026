INTRODUCTION
[1]
Lemieux, J.
: The defendant, Alistair Ker (the defendant), moves, pursuant to paragraph 416(1)(f) and (g) of the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
(the
Rules
) for an order to have the plaintiff Karel Fortyn pay security for costs in this action. These particular paragraphs are new and have not been interpreted. The plaintiff argues the circumstances in this case are not covered by the cited paragraphs; the defendant has not met the required onus and, in any event, rule 417, the impecuniosity provision, provides a shield to the requested order.
[2]
Paragraphs 416(1)(f) and (g) and section 417 of the
Rules
read:
"416(1) Where, on the motion of a
defendant
, it appears to the Court that
(a) the plaintiff is ordinarily resident outside Canada,
(b) the plaintiff is a corporation, an unincorporated association or a nominal plaintiff and there is reason to believe that the plaintiff would have insufficient assets in Canada available to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so,
(c) the plaintiff has not provided an address in the statement of claim, or has provided an incorrect address therein, and has not satisfied the Court that the omission or misstatement was made innocently and without intention to deceive,
(d) the plaintiff has changed address during the course of the proceeding with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation,
(e) the plaintiff has another proceeding for the same relief pending elsewhere,
(f)
the defendant has an order
against the plaintiff for costs in the same or another proceeding that remain unpaid in whole or in part
,
(g)
there is reason to believe that the action is frivolous and vexatious and the plaintiff would have insufficient assets in Canada available to pay the costs of the defendant
, if ordered to do so, or
(h) an Act of Parliament entitles the defendant to security for costs,
the Court may order the plaintiff to give security for the defendant's costs.
"(2) The Court may order that security for the costs of a defendant be given in stages, as costs are incurred.
. . . . .
"417. The Court may refuse to order that security for costs be given under any of paragraphs 416(1)(a) to (g)
if a plaintiff demonstrates impecuniosity and the Court is of the opinion that the case has merit
." (emphasis mine)
"416(1) Lorsque, par suite d'une requête du défendeur, il paraît évident à la Cour que l'une des situations visées aux alinéas a) à h) existe, elle peut ordonner au demandeur de fournir le cautionnement pour les dépens qui pourraient être adjugés au défendeur:
a) le demandeur réside habituellement hors du Canada;
b) le demandeur est une personne morale ou une association sans personnalité morale ou n'est demandeur que de nom et il y a lieu de croire qu'il ne détient pas au Canada des actifs suffisants pour payer les dépens advenant qu'il lui soit ordonné de le faire;
c) le demandeur n'a pas indiqué d'adresse dans la déclaration, ou y a inscrit une adresse erronée, et il n'a pas convaincu la Cour que l'omission ou l'erreur a été faite involontairement et sans intention de tromper;
d) le demandeur a changé d'adresse au cours de l'instance en vue de se soustraire aux conséquences du litige;
e) le demandeur est partie à une autre instance en cours ailleurs qui vise la même réparation;
f) le défendeur a obtenu une ordonnance contre le demandeur pour les dépens afférents à la même instance ou à une autre instance et ces dépens demeurent impayés en totalité ou en partie;
g) il y a lieu de croire que l'action est frivole ou vexatoire et que le demandeur ne détient pas au Canada des actifs suffisants pour payer les dépens s'il lui est ordonné de le faire;
h) une loi fédérale autorise le défendeur à obtenir un cautionnement pour les dépens.
"(2) La Cour peut ordonner que le cautionnement pour les dépens soit fourni en tranches représentant les dépens engagés.
. . . . .
"417. La Cour peut refuser d'ordonner la fourniture d'un cautionnement pour les dépens dans les situations visées aux alinéas 416(1)a) à g) si le demandeur fait la preuve de son indigence et si elle est convaincue du bien-fondé de la cause."
BACKGROUND
[3]
The plaintiff Fortyn and the defendant Ker in 1993 formed a partnership known as Seaway Serpentarium (the Partnership), the other plaintiff; it operated a reptile zoo in a shopping mall in Welland, Ontario. The enterprise failed and became the subject matter of much litigation in the Ontario courts. First, the defendant commenced an action against the plaintiff in 1994; this proceeding was stayed pending arbitration; the plaintiff was awarded costs which have yet to be assessed. Second, the partnership was dissolved by the arbitrator on March 25, 1995 and the reptile collection ordered to be sold by private sale, which I gather did not happen; costs were reserved and the issue is outstanding. Third, the landlord sued the plaintiff and the defendant and obtained
default judgment
on July 5, 1996, against the plaintiff Fortyn in the amount of $24,561.05 and $482.90 in costs. This judgement was assigned to the defendant Ker in May of 1997 after payment of the default judgment by the defendant Ker to the landlord.
[4]
The plaintiffs then commenced an action in this Court on July 17, 1997. The claim is for general damages of $1,500.00 U.S. and special damages of $100,000.00 U.S. The action concerns 10 Albino Monocle Cobra juvenile snakes and their destruction by the Canadian Wildlife Service which is how the other defendant, Her Majesty the Queen, (who did not appear on this motion) came into the picture. The plaintiffs allege illegal seizure and destruction. The allegation against the defendant Ker is that he unlawfully authorized their destruction by the Canadian Wildlife Service representing he was their owner or had authority over their disposition.
[5]
In a responding affidavit to the defendant Ker's motion for security for costs, the plaintiff Fortyn adds he is "impecunious and has no monies with which to pay security for costs and I will be unable to pursue this matter in the event this Honourable Court orders that I pay security for costs". The plaintiff was not cross-examined on his affidavit.
DISCUSSION
(a)
Interpretive principles
[6]
Paragraphs (f) and (g) of rule 416(1) were incorporated into the
Rules
. I have found no decisions which interpret the scope of these paragraphs although a version of the security for costs rule appeared in the former
Rules
.
[7]
For the interpretation of the paragraphs of these
Rules
, I take as a point of departure what Iacobucci, J., said in
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1, quoting at page 41 from Driedger in
Construction of Statutes
, (2nd Ed. 1983) page 87:
"Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament."
(b)
General principles of security for costs
[8]
Rule 416 says this Court may order the plaintiff to give security for the defendant's costs if it appears to the Court that one of the circumstances described in paragraphs (a) to (h) is shown.
[9]
Rothstein, J., as a member of the Federal Court Trial Division, said in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 313 (T.D.) at 317, in a case under the former
Rules
: "Placing the onus on the defendants recognizes that plaintiffs under the jurisdiction of the Court do not normally have to provide security for costs". This comment, in my view, clearly demonstrates that a security for costs motion under rule 416 is not granted automatically and under rule 417 can be refused if access to the Court is thwarted where a case has merit and the plaintiff is impecunious.
[10]
Under the former
Rules
, a number of decisions touched upon the issue of granting security for costs. I cite
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Denault, J., dealing with both when and at what level security for costs should be granted, stated at paragraph 8:
"There are some preliminary observations which, at the outset, should be noted. First, pursuant to rule 446, this court has complete discretion in granting security for costs. In the exercise of this discretion I find it useful to quote Prothonotary Hargrave who aptly stated the following in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at p. 190:
'In deciding on appropriate security for costs there are also other points that I have kept in mind including that "an allowance will have to be made for the unquenchable fire of human optimism and the likelihood that the figure of taxed costs put forward would not emerge unscathed after taxation" (
Procon Ltd.
, supra, at p. 571) [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; that every case, this included, will not necessarily be fought through to a finish and therefore security for costs might be somewhat less; that security for costs ought not be illusory, but at the same time ought not be oppressive so as to hamper the plaintiff in bringing a legitimate lawsuit; and that if the security proves inadequate, the defendant can always reapply for additional security at a later date.'
. . . . .
"That is, this Court cannot verify receipts, hotel bills, number of photocopies and so on. It is to be remembered that, in an application for security for costs, it is not this Court's role to examine every cost incurred to determine whether to grant the application.
"Finally, even though a trial date has been set, there is no certainty that the parties will actually proceed to trial. I cannot exclude the possibility of a settlement or that the duration of the trial will not be as lengthy as anticipated."
(c)
Application of paragraph 416(1)(f)
[11]
The defendant first invokes paragraph 416(1)(f) of the
Rules
. I am satisfied the evidence establishes the defendant, Alistair Ker, has an order for costs in another proceeding within the meaning of those words in this paragraph of the
Rules
, against the plaintiff, Karel Fortyn. This order was obtained by way of assignment of judgment.
[12]
The question is, however, whether the words "in another proceeding" in this paragraph extend to costs obtained in proceedings other than those engaged in this Court, i.e. as in this case a proceeding in the Ontario courts.
[13]
The word "proceeding" is not defined in rule 2 of the
Rules
and its ordinary meaning is wide enough to encompass any legal action wherever taken as noted by Cullen, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) at 158-159. In addition, the scope of this word in section 50 of the
Federal Court Act
has been determined by the Federal Court of Appeal not to be limited to proceedings taken in this Court (see,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)).
[14]
However, these cases were decided in a different context related to section 50 of the
Federal Court Act
. Rule 416 does not contain the words "in another court or jurisdiction" as does section 50 of the
Federal Court Act
perhaps suggesting an intention not to extend its scope to other than Federal Court proceedings.
[15]
Such a conclusion does not satisfy an analysis of the question on a proper contextual or purposive approach to rule 416. This Rule, when read as a whole, indicates its true purpose. The main objective of this Rule is to ensure that, in special circumstances, not normal ones, in the event a defendant is successful in proceedings before this Court, that defendant will be able to look to the security for payment of awarded costs. Taking into account the prescribed circumstances, this is not a minor objective given the reality check of tariff increases reflected in the
Rules
as compared to the former
Rules
.
[16]
For these reasons, I conclude the scope of the words "other proceedings" is not limited to proceedings in this Court. I add another factor. This Court has Canada-wide jurisdiction which is exclusive in some matters and concurrent in others but more than any other Court, except the Supreme Court of Canada, interfaces with parties who, in other contexts, may have had proceedings, whether arising out of federal law or not, in provincial courts. This special context requires these
Rules
be interpreted to include costs awarded by those courts.
(d)
Application of paragraph 416(1)(g)
[17]
Insofar as paragraph 416(1)(g) is concerned, the defendant has not established this case falls within the frivolous or vexatious test well recognized in the jurisprudence of this Court. The plaintiff's case is not plainly and obviously devoid of merits.
(e)
Does the rule 417 shield apply
[18]
Rule 417 is also a new Rule which has not been interpreted by this Court but, as noted below, it codifies some common law principles developed in this court and in other jurisdictions. The first branch to be met is whether the plaintiff is impecunious and the second branch is whether the case has merit. The second branch of this Rule has been met, in this case, by the linkage to paragraph 416(1)(g), frivolous and vexatious test raised unsuccessfully by the defendant.
[19]
As to impecuniosity, Teitelbaum, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), stated at paragraphs 17-18:
"After verifying the facts as to the Plaintiff's financial situation, I am satisfied there is no merit to the allegation that the Plaintiff is impecunious. The
New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary On Historical Principles
(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993) defines the word 'impecunious' as 'in need of money, poor, penniless'.
The American Heritage Dictionary
defines the word 'impecunious' as 'lacking money - penniless'. The word 'impecunious' is an adjective to denote someone who is 'poor' or 'impoverished' or 'needy'.
"As I have stated, it is difficult to find the Plaintiff to be poor or impoverished or needy. From his affidavit evidence, and from the evidence obtained in an examination for discovery of Plaintiff, it is, in my opinion, difficult to consider the Plaintiff as one in need of money or poor or penniless."
[20]
In Ontario, this concept was explained by the Divisional Court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Div. Ct.), in the following terms at page 704:
"When the defendant has shown that there is good reason to believe that the plaintiff has insufficient assets in Ontario the defendant has met its onus and is prima facie entitled to an order for security for costs,
and the onus shifts to the plaintiff to introduce evidence to show either:
(a) that it has sufficient assets in Ontario, or
(b) that (i) it is impecunious and (ii) an injustice would result if it were not allowed to proceed with its action.
"Here the plaintiff did not introduce evidence to show that it had sufficient assets in Ontario, nor did it introduce evidence to show that it was 'impecunious'. There was simply no evidence on the question from the plaintiff. Accordingly, on that basis alone, there is nothing to displace the prima facie entitlement of the defendant for an order for security. Pleadings which are contradictory are not evidence.
Impecuniosity has to be established by evidence.
"The term 'impecuniosity' does not appear in the rule; it is a term introduced as part of the judicial gloss upon the rule in response to the words 'as is just' in the part of the rule stating that (upon satisfaction of the stated conditions precedent) 'the court ... may make such order as is just'. The corporate plaintiff wishing to be allowed to proceed with its action, without either showing sufficient assets or putting up security,
must first show 'impecuniosity' meaning not only that it does not have sufficient assets itself but also that it cannot raise the security for costs from its shareholders and associates, partly because the courts do not want a successful defendant to be effectively deprived of costs where, for example, wealthy shareholders have decided to carry on business and litigation through a shell corporation. To go the impecuniosity route the plaintiff must establish by evidence that it cannot raise security for costs because, if a private company, its shareholders have not sufficient assets.
As expressed by Reid, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 709, 15 C.P.C. (2d) 187: 'If an order for security stops a plaintiff in its tracks it has disposed of the suit.' To raise impecuniosity there must be evidence that if security is required the suit will be stopped -- because the amount of the security is not only not possessed by the plaintiff but is not available to it. Here there is simply no evidence to that effect." (emphasis mine)
[21]
The problem I see for the plaintiff is that he, in his affidavit, has simply made a bald statement he is impecunious. He does not spell out in any detail his impecuniosity. Such a statement, even in an affidavit, without backup, does not satisfy the Rule. The plaintiff has to do more; he has to establish prima facie the facts which would enable this Court to determine that, in fact, he is impecunious. If the matter is controverted by the defendant, the plaintiff's burden is to establish his impecuniosity on the balance of probabilities. In this case, it is my view the plaintiff, in his affidavit, did not pass the prima facie gate.
[22]
The defendant provided me with a draft bill of costs totalling $18,000 as costs, actual and anticipated in this case.
[23]
I am not satisfied the defendant's projected bill of costs is realistic and would muster past an assessment officer.
[24]
Taking into account all of the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff is ordered to deposit the amount of $5,000 as security for costs in this matter.
[25]
For all of these reasons, the defendant's motion is granted. This is not an appropriate proceeding in which costs should be awarded.
Motion allowed.
