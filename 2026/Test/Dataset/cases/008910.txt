Rothstein, J.
: This is an appeal by the defendant from an order of Giles, A.S.P., dated August 23, 1994 and signed on September 15, 1994 in which, inter alia, he struck certain portions of the defendants' statement of defence.
[2]
The plaintiff's action is for infringement of three patents relating to excimer lasers used for eye surgery. The paragraphs in question (17, 27, 28, 29 and 32) of the statement of defence and counterclaim allege:
(1) that the plaintiff is attempting to extract fees or royalties from doctors and others in respect of a medical treatment which it is said cannot be the subject of a patent;
(2) that the plaintiff's action constitutes an undue limitation or restraint on competition under ss. 32(a) to (e) of the
Competition Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34 and an abuse of dominant position under s. 79(1) of the
Competition Act
.
[3]
Paragraph 36(c) of the statement of defence seeks an order, by reason of the aforesaid allegations, that the plaintiff's patents are unenforceable.
[4]
The essence of the defendants' position is that the plaintiff's actions, in attempting to extract inappropriate fees and in contravening the
Competition Act
, disentitled the plaintiff to equitable relief in its action. The defendants say that the plaintiff may be entitled to damages if it is successful, but it is not entitled to an injunction or to an accounting of the defendants' profits which are equitable forms of relief.
[5]
The defendants rely on
Lilly (Eli) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) in which Addy, J., stated at page 255:
"2. A more cogent reason, however, is that the plaintiffs are seeking equitable relief and must come into the court with their hands clean. Should they in fact be in breach of the
Combines Investigation Act
, as alleged in para. 9 of the statement of defence, this would constitute a most valid reason for refusing injunction relief although the allegations might well not constitute a defence to a claim at law."
However, the dicta of Addy, J., in
Eli Lilly
has been refined by
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) in which Hugessen, J.A., stated at page 546:
"We are all of the view that the motions judge erred in law since these allegations [breaches of the
Competition Act
] can simply have no bearing on the defence to the plaintiffs' action for patent infringement. The motions judge indicated [at p. 230] that, because para. 16 speaks to plaintiffs' entitlement to equitable remedies, the amendment would be relevant to the courts 'discretion to grant or refuse such relief having regard to all of the surrounding circumstances including the past conduct of the plaintiffs'. This is error. For past conduct to be relevant to a refusal of equitable relief under the 'clean hands' doctrine, relief to which the party would otherwise be entitled, such conduct must relate directly to the subject-matter of the plaintiffs' claim, in this case their patent ..."
It is apparent that it is not any alleged inappropriate conduct of a party that may be relevant in the consideration of whether or not to grant equitable relief. The inappropriate conduct must relate directly to the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim.
[6]
In the case at bar, it may be that the plaintiff should not collect royalties in the way it is alleged it does. Or it may be that its conduct is contrary to certain provisions of the
Competition Act
. However, even if the plaintiff is acting inappropriately, such actions do not relate directly to the plaintiff's patent or whether the defendants are infringing that patent. There is no suggestion that the patent is invalid or otherwise cannot form the basis of a patent infringement action; nor is it suggested that these allegations, in some way, indicate there is no patent infringement. It has not been demonstrated that such conduct is directly related to the plaintiff's claim.
[7]
The appeal from the order of Giles, A.S.P., is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
