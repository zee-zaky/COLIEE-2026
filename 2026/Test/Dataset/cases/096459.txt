Reed, J.
: The appellant (defendant) brings a motion to have the referee's report of March 15, 1990, set aside, varied or altered. The respondents (plaintiffs) bring a motion to have that report confirmed and judgment entered in accordance therewith. The report assesses the amount payable, by the defendant to the plaintiffs, as profits earned by the defendant from the sale of "convertible rowers". Convertible rowers are a type of exercise equipment. The manufacture and sale of that equipment, by the defendant, was held to be an infringement of the plaintiff's patent, number 1,185,631. [see footnote 1]
[2]
The defendant challenges the referee's report on three grounds: (1) the wrong accounting approach was chosen to assess the amount of the defendant's profits; (2) the burden of proof required of the defendant, in proving its relevant costs, was too high; (3) even if the proper accounting approach was chosen, it was improperly applied, and costs which should have been deducted from the profits payable were left out of the accounting.
Accounting Approach
[3]
Insofar as the appropriate accounting approach is concerned, the defendant argues that the full cost method (sometimes called the full absorption method) should have been used. It is argued that the differential cost accounting approach (sometimes called the incremental approach) is not appropriate because it is a method used to estimate future costs or profits, for present decision making purposes. It is argued that the method is not designed to determine profits already earned. Reference was made in this regard to J.M. Fremgen and S.S. Liao, The Allocation of Corporate Indirect Costs (pages 18 and 19) and to Kohler's Dictionary for Accountants, 6th Edition, ed. W.W. Cooper and Yuji Ijin (pages 172, 256, 257 and 319).
[4]
While the differential approach is used in the circumstances mentioned above, there is no reason to assume that those are the only circumstances in which it may be appropriate. It is well-established, since the decision of Mr. Justice Addy in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), that a differential or incremental approach is appropriate to determine an accounting of a defendant's profits in patent infringement cases. Mr. Justice Addy, discusses the rationale at pages 208-211 of the Teledyne case. At page 210, he referred to the differential method as being the proper approach to determine the profit added to an existing business, as the result of the establishment of a new product line. He quoted from the referee's report which was before him:
"(a) A business that is already operating sells a new product line. If management wanted to determine how much profit was contributed to its business by selling that new product, then such would be calculated by deducting from the revenue of that new product its variable costs and only that portion of fixed costs that increased as a result of selling the new product line. This calculation would not allocate any portion of the fixed costs that would have been incurred by the company whether or not it had sold the new product line."
Mr. Preston, the referee in this case, described the difference between the full cost and the incremental approach:
"In a full cost approach all indirect or fixed costs are allocated to a specific cost centre based on some rational foundation, whereas with the incremental cost approach you try to access what portion of indirect costs were increased as a result of the manufacture and sale of a particular product."
[5]
It is clear that, the profit which a defendant can make from the manufacture and sale of an infringing product will vary with the particular circumstances of the defendant's business. A prospective defendant who has excess production capacity (unused warehouse space, underused machinery or underemployed personnel) would find the manufacture and sale of an infringing product more profitable than would a defendant who had to incur additional fixed costs before such manufacture and sale could take place. In addition, a defendant who is already in the same business as the potential plaintiff, may find many additional costs to be minimal in nature. For example, selling and advertising costs, might involve no more than the addition of a description of the infringing item to an existing sales catalogue. The infringing product could be added, as merely one among many which salesmen would discuss with prospective purchasers when travelling for selling purpose. Indeed, one can speculate that a potential infringer who is operating from a position of excess productive capacity and is in the same business as the plaintiff, could afford to be more careless about potential infringement than could a manufacturer who was not in that position.
[6]
The objective sought to attained, by allowing the plaintiff to elect an award based on an accounting of the defendant's profits, is to require the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs
all of the profits
earned from the manufacture and sale of the infringing product. If the defendant can produce the product more profitably than the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to the whole of that profit. At the same time a plaintiff is not required to accept a lesser amount than it could have made itself. In such a case, an election of damages is available.
[7]
In the present case, there has been no convincing reason given as to why a differential accounting approach is not appropriate. The infringing rowers were manufactured and sold by a division of the defendant, called the Homeware Division. That division, both before and during the time when it manufactured the infringing rowers, manufactured and sold a variety of other exercise equipment. The division itself is part of the larger diversified business enterprise of the defendant, Tye-Sil. Tye-Sil's other business interests include the manufacture and sale of gift wrapping, Christmas cards, Christmas decorations, paper tableware, lawn furniture and pressure sensitive vinyl products. The infringing rowers constituted 2.3% of Tye-Sil's gross sales in 1985; they constituted 7.5% in 1986 and 3.6% in 1987. As a percentage of the sales of the Homeware Division, the rowers constituted 20.4%, 28.6% and 9.2%, respectively, for the years in question. In general the infringing rowers were manufactured in the Homeware Division plants in Laurel (Orangeville) and Tottenham, Ontario. For three months in 1986, the manufacture of some Homeware products took place in Montreal, in the Tye-Sil division which usually makes lawn furniture. The production capabilities of that division were not needed for the production of lawn furniture at the time.
[8]
The defendant's Homeware Division used the same plant, equipment and personnel to make the infringing rowers as it used to make noninfringing exercise equipment. No new or additional equipment or machinery was required or purchased (except for a strapping machine) and no new employees were hired except to replace employees who left the company (with the exception of one salesman). Indeed, many of the same component parts are used for infringing and noninfringing equipment.
[9]
In the circumstances of the present case, to allow the defendant to deduct costs attributable proportionally to the operation of the total business of the Homeware Division, including a share of the general office and management costs, regardless of whether or not those costs would have been incurred had the manufacture and sale of the infringing product not taken place, would constitute an unjust enrichment of the defendant. It would not give an accurate picture of the profit which the defendant actually obtained from the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers.
Nature And Burden Of Proof
[10]
With respect to the burden of proof which rests upon the defendant, Mr. Justice Addy in the Teledyne case, at page 209, explained:
"... Where the defendant, as in the present case, has been found at fault and has been ordered to account, that obligation to account rests without reservation entirely on him. There exists no onus whatsoever in this respect on the owner of the property. The judgment obliges the defendant to account for the full amount of all revenue received from the use of the property. Negligent or wilful failure to declare any such amounts might well render the infringer guilty of contempt of court. The amount so declared becomes payable to the rightful owner of the property and
is subject to be reduced only by such bona fide expenses
or disbursements
as the infringer can by positive evidence establish as having been actually incurred
..." (underlining added)
And, at page 213:
"To summarize: the infringer is entitled to deduct only those expenses, both variable and fixed, which actually contributed to the sums received and for which he is liable to account. It follows that no part or proportion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing operation not taken place, is to be considered as deductible."
[11]
Counsel for the plaintiffs also referred to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.C., 9th Cir.). While that case deals with the law of California, in my view, it aptly describes the law of this jurisdiction. I adopt the wording used by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. In establishing an infringer's profits, the plaintiff is required to prove only the defendant's sales; the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove the elements of cost to be deducted from the sales in arriving at profit. Any doubts as to the computation of costs or profits is to be resolved in favour of the plaintiff. At the same time, this does not mean that the infringer must prove expenses such as overhead and their relationship to the infringing product in minute detail. But the defendant bears the burden of explaining, at least in general terms, how claimed overhead costs actually contributed to the production of the infringing product.
[12]
The nature of the proof required, which respect to overhead expenses, was discussed at p. 694:
"We do not doubt that some of the defendant's claimed overhead contributed to the production of 'Hallelujah Hollywood'. The difficulty we have, however, is that defendants offered no evidence of what costs were included in general categories such as 'general and administrative expenses', nor did they offer any evidence concerning how these costs contributed to the production of 'Hallelujah Hollywood'. The defendants contend their burden was met when they introduced evidence of their total overhead costs allocated on a reasonable basis. The district court apparently agreed with this approach. That is not the law of this circuit. Under Kamar International, a defendant additionally must show that the categories of overhead actually contributed to sales of the infringing work ... We can find no such showing in the record before us. Therefore, we conclude that the district courts finding that defendants have established that these items of general expense [the general categories of claimed overhead] contributed to the production of 'Hallelujah Hollywood' was clearly erroneous."
[13]
While, the defendant accepts that the burden is upon it to prove its relevant costs, counsel argues that in doing so it is only necessary for the defendant to establish such costs on the balance of probabilities (on a reasonable and probable basis). He argues that the referee, Mr. Preston, applied a burden of proof which is applicable in criminal cases, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I have carefully read Mr. Preston's report and do not find that he imposed so heavy a burden. He required the defendant to prove its costs in accordance with the tests set out by Mr. Justice Addy above. This does not constitute imposing the burden of proof required in criminal cases. This will appear more clearly from what is said below with respect to the various cost items in dispute.
[14]
Counsel for the defendant argued, in addition, that the application of the differential or incremental accounting approach is one which by its very nature imposes an unreasonable burden on the defendant. It is argued that this follows because it is impossible, or at least very difficult, for the defendant to prove all its costs using that approach. I have not been persuaded by this argument. In my view, any accounting method will to some extent be an approximation or an estimate. The question is which accounting method is more appropriate for the objective sought by the accounting in question. I am not convinced that the burden on the defendant, arising out of the use of the incremental accounting approach, is so unreasonable, unjust or inexact as to render the approach set out by Mr. Justice Addy inappropriate. Indeed, it is my view that the incremental method gives a truer accounting, of the type required for the purposes of this case, than does the full absorption method.
Specific Cost Items - Assessed On A Differential Accounting Basis
[15]
The formula for calculating profits pursuant to the differential method is not in dispute. The profits are calculated by taking
the total of:
(i) all
sales revenue
(net sales) arising from the sale of the infringing product;
less:
(ii) any
direct costs
attributable to the production and sale of the infringing product, and
(iii) any
increase in common costs
specifically incurred to sustain the production and sale of the infringing products.
[16]
There is no dispute between the parties concerning the amount of sales revenue derived by the defendant from the sale of the infringing rowers. The plaintiffs agreed, before the referee, to accept the defendant's figure of $5,102,256.00. It differed from their own calculations by only a small amount.
[17]
The two broad categories of costs to be deducted from revenues, then, are direct costs and common costs specifically incurred as a result of the production and sale of the rowers. These were described as follows:
(a)
Direct Costs
, are costs that can be directly tied to a specific unit of production or with a specific activity required solely for the manufacture and sale of the infringing product; and
(b)
Common Costs
, otherwise known as indirect costs, are costs incurred for the benefit of two or more products or services. (Common costs are generally
not deducted
in calculating net profit when using a differential method of accounting, except for particular items of common costs that can be shown to have increased specifically for the production and sale of the infringing product, in which case an allocation of a prorated portion of the common costs may be deducted from revenue to calculate net profit.) [see footnote 2]
(a) Direct Costs
[18]
Direct costs were divided into those attributable to the purchase of materials and those attributable to labour. Mr. Preston assessed the direct material costs at $2,414,210.00 and the direct labour costs at $397,982.00. There is no dispute, before me, concerning the assessment of the direct labour costs. The defendant contends, however, that the direct material costs should be reduced by $75,936.00. At the same time, the defendant argues that a third category of direct costs, called ancillary costs, amounting to $464,304.00, should be deducted. It is argued that amounts attributable to export duties, $4,815.00, and certain destroyed inventory, $45,496.00, should also be deducted.
[19]
Insofar as the amounts claimed on account of export duties and destroyed inventory are concerned, these can be easily dealt with. There is absolutely no evidence that the defendant paid any amount on account of the export duties which it claims as an expense. Indeed, counsel did not even attempt to make argument on this point. The referee was clearly right in not allowing this item. The destroyed inventory comprised infringing rowers which were returned to the defendant, or which the defendant could not sell, as a result of this court's order of July 30, 1987. (The order which found the rowers to be infringements of the plaintiffs' patent.) In disallowing this item, Mr. Preston followed the principle set out by Mr. Justice Addy in the Teledyne case, supra, at pages 217-218. The application of that principle dictates that the inventory which is destroyed as a result of an order finding it to infringe patent rights should not be considered a deductible cost. This follows because the expenditures relating to those rowers do not relate to the earning of any money for which the defendant is liable to account for the plaintiffs. The amount in question was properly excluded by Mr. Preston from the accounting of profits.
[20]
At the same time, I note that Mr. Preston would appear to have allowed the defendant an amount of account of labour costs associated with the production of the destroyed rowers. He accepted the defendant's figure for direct labour costs, which was higher than that proposed by the plaintiffs. He stated that the difference between the two arose because of their different treatment of labour costs with respect to the units which were returned in 1988 and 1989. The plaintiffs chose not to take issue with Mr. Preston's assessment, in this regard. Accordingly, I have not treated it as in issue before me.
[21]
To turn, then, to the defendant's claim that the amount allowed, by Mr. Preston, for direct material costs should be reduced by $75,936.00 and another category of direct costs, called ancillary costs, amounting to $464,304.00, should be added. The deduction of $75,936.00, from Mr. Preston's assessment of direct materials costs, purports to remove therefrom costs relating to: scrap, obsolescence, shrinkage and warranty repairs. The new category of ancillary costs purports to encompass costs relating to: currency fluctuations; inaccuracies in cost records; price fluctuations; learning curve costs; overtime and night shift premiums; production of samples and prototypes; labour costs associated with reworking defective returns; scrap; obsolete components; shrinkage; changes from original specifications. The defendant proposes to determine the amount of such direct ancillary costs on a global basis rather than by specific proof of actual expenditures relating to the infringing rowers.
[22]
The defendant's expert, Mr. Wiener, assesses the direct ancillary costs by taking figures from the financial statements of the company for the years in question and establishing thereby the net sales of the Homeware Division for all products sold by it. He then, determines, the costs of the goods sold by the Homeware Division. This calculation is done by adding together amounts shown on the general ledger for opening inventories, purchases and "direct" labour costs, then subtracting therefrom closing inventories. He subtracts the costs, thus determined from net sales for the Division and obtains a gross profit figure for the Homeware Division, for each of the years in question. From this, a figure for gross profits as a percentage of sales, for the Homeware Division, is calculated.
[23]
In the course of the proceedings, before Mr. Preston, it became obvious that what had been labelled "direct" labour costs, by the defendant, in the above described calculation, included indirect labour costs. The original calculations were accordingly reworked to subtract the indirect labour expense. It is not necessary to describe that calculation in detail except to say that since 1986 was the only year for which appropriate figures were in evidence, an indirect labour factor (as a percentage of direct labour) was established for that year. That factor was then applied to the labour costs shown for all three years, in order to obtain what purports to be the proper direct labour costs for those years. The revised calculations led to the gross profit percentage (as a percentage of sales), for the Homeware Division for 1985, 1986 and 1987 being calculated as 36.35%, 33.05% and 28.29% respectively. Prior to the removal of the indirect labour costs these had been calculated as 31.41%, 28.78% and 22.94%.
[24]
Mr. Wiener, then, turned to the production cost sheets for the infringing rowers. These are estimates prepared by employees of the company, prior to the manufacture and sale of the rowers. They attempt to forecast the cost of materials and labour for the purpose of enabling the defendant to know at what price the rowers should be sold. Mr. Wiener took the cost of materials (component parts) and labour from these sheets and added thereto comparable cost figures from the production cost sheets for some of the other products sold by the Homeware Division. He did not include in this calculation the 3% which was indicated on the sheets as a cost arising from "waste". Nor did he include the 10% surcharge for material costs and the 12% surcharge for labour costs which had been added, by the defendant to the cost sheets, after Mr. Justice Cullen's decision of July 30, 1987, had been rendered.
[25]
The other Homeware products which were chosen to be added to the infringing rowers, in order to get a sample for comparison to the gross profit percentage figure (which had been obtained from the financial statements and general ledgers) were "best seller" items. The rowers together with these other "best sellers" comprised 70% of the products manufactured and sold by the Homeware Division. "Best sellers" are those items which account on a product category basis for the largest amounts of revenue. Mr. Wiener subtracted the cost of material and labour which he took from the production cost sheets from the net sales revenue for these products. Thus, a profit figure for these was calculated which allegedly did not include any direct ancillary costs. From this a profit percentage figure as a ratio of profit to material and labour costs was obtained. These were calculated to be 46.51%, 41.74% and 35.32%, for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 respectively. Mr. Wiener asserts that the ancillary direct costs should, then, be determined by calculating the difference between the gross profit percentage, which he calculated from the financial statements and general ledgers, and the profit percentage he calculated from the production cost sheets. This it is argued gives one the ancillary direct costs as a percentage of sales.
[26]
When the percentages thus determined are multiplied against the net revenue figures for the infringing rowers for the years in question, in Mr. Wiener's view, the actual direct ancillary costs are thereby determined. The first step is to calculate: 46.51%-36.35%; 41.74%-33.05%; and 35.32%-28.29%. This gives 10.78%, 8.84% and 7.06% respectively. The second step is, then, to take: 10.28% of $1,261,807.00 for 1985; 8.84% of $3,090,916.00 for 1986; and 7.06% of $868,483.00 for 1987. When added together the ancillary costs are thus said to total $464,304.00. (Before the reworking of the figures to remove the indirect labour costs, the amount claimed by the defendant had been $705,138.00).
[27]
This analysis raises many questions. The initial inadvertent inclusion of indirect labour costs in the calculation alerts one to the difficulty of comparing the two types of figures which are being used by Mr. Wiener. More importantly, however, the selection of only the 70% "best sellers" of the Homeware Division raises a host of questions about the appropriateness of the comparison which it is sought to draw on that basis. Mr. Wiener's analysis assumes that the ancillary costs for all of the products of the Homeware Division are the same. It assumes that each product bears a proportionate share of ancillary costs based on a percentage of sales. It assumes that the profit margin on the 30% worst sellers is the same as that on the 70% best sellers.
[28]
In reviewing and assessing the evidence of the experts, Mr. Preston rejected Mr. Wiener's evidence on direct ancillary costs and accepted the plaintiffs' analysis. At page 34 of his reasons, Mr. Preston wrote:
"After a thorough consideration of Mr. Belbeck's [the plaintiffs' expert] evidence I am satisfied that, with the material he was provided with by the defendant, he carefully scrutinized the defendant's financial records, cost sheets, invoices and such other documents made available to him and using proper accounting principles for a differential assessment of the profits prepared his affidavit. His evidence was presented without bias and several times on cross-examination he made minor changes in his calculations after having considered the affidavit and exhibits filed by Mr. Wiener."
[29]
The plaintiffs' analysis of the defendant's records started with the production cost sheets, mentioned above. These had been prepared by the defendant for the purpose of determining the price at which the convertible rowers should be sold. These were verified in 1986 as accurate for the defendant's internal purposes. This was done by a Mr. Archambault, an employee of the defendant. [see footnote 3]
[30]
Mr. Gayler, undertook on behalf of the plaintiffs, a comparison of the material cost of the component parts which had been estimated on the production sheets with the actual price paid for the component parts appearing on "Cardex Cards". These cards record the actual prices paid by the defendant for the parts during the years in question. Mr. Gayler found the cost sheets to be very accurate. He found that the defendant had slightly over-estimated its costs, by about $16,000.00. This verification by Mr. Gayler, necessarily, took into account any variations from the production cost sheet estimates which would have arisen as a result of currency fluctuations, inaccuracies in cost records or price fluctuations. Thus, three of the items which the defendant alleges would be encompassed by the ancillary costs heading were included in this aspect of the plaintiffs' analysis of the defendant's records.
[31]
With respect to price fluctuations, counsel for the defendant argues that the cost of the component parts varies from time to time and that since one can not trace exactly which component part went into which rower (or indeed into rowers as opposed to into other types of exercise equipment) one cannot establish the cost of the rowers with exactitude. Mr. Gayler's analysis of the cardex cards established average prices over the period of time in question. This is a reasonable and probable basis for establishing those costs. The defendant's objection is not a reasonable one.
[32]
Four of the items, which the defendant contends should be dealt with under the ancillary cost heading, relate to labour costs: learning curve costs; overtime and night shift premiums; production of samples and prototypes; the labour costs associated with reworking defective returns. The last (labour costs associated with reworking defective returns) will be considered below in discussing warranty costs. With respect to the first two items, listed above, (learning curve costs and overtime and night shift premiums) there is every reason to think that amounts to cover these were included in the estimates found in the production cost sheets. The figures attributed to labour on those sheets were average cost figures, designed to take account of costs incurred as a result of employees who worked at less than a standard level as well as those who worked at a better than standard level. Mr. Archambault's evidence was that when he checked the cost sheets in 1986 they were an accurate reflection of what it cost the company to produce the rowers.
[33]
With respect to the costs associated with the production of samples and prototypes, the plaintiffs' expert initially proposed to Mr. Preston that an amount for this type of expense be allowed. However, the evidence before Mr. Preston established that one employee in the Homeware Division looked after all samples and prototypes for the division and that the expense relating to his salary had not increased as a result of the manufacturing and sale of the rowers. The amount originally suggested as appropriate was thus deleted.
[34]
With respect to the amount which should be allocated for scrap, obsolete components and shrinkage, the defendant's production sheets added a 3% factor for "waste". Counsel for the defendant argues that this should only be considered as referrable to waste on account of scrap, not including obsolescence and shrinkage. Mr. Preston accepted the plaintiffs' argument that the 3% should be interpreted as covering the three categories. The plaintiffs buttressed their position, in this regard, by pointing out that their experience in manufacturing the same machine led them to conclude that a 3% wastage factor on account of scrap, obsolescence and shrinkage was appropriate. The plaintiffs also noted that their scrap expenses should be greater than the defendant's. The plaintiffs manufacture many of the component parts for the rowers themselves while the defendant purchases its component parts. With respect to obsolete components, it should also be noted that the defendant's practice was to phase out the usage of any such part, whenever possible, by making a change to a new part only after the existing inventory of the old part had been used. In the case of costs resulting from shrinkage, these were reported on the cardex cards and a precise figure, in this regard, could have been calculated by the defendant had it chosen to do so. There is no reason to think that costs incurred as a result of scrap, obsolete components and shrinkage were not adequately accounted for by Mr. Preston's acceptance of the 3% figure.
[35]
With respect to the engineering change notices, there is no evidence that any of these resulted in additional costs to the defendant. Indeed, the evidence suggests that some changes, at least, were made to save the defendant money. As a matter of logic one would expect that such changes would be as likely to lead to cost savings as to additional expenditures.
[36]
With respect to warranty repairs the plaintiffs calculated from the defendant's records the number of returns which occurred in 1986 and found that 1.8% of the units were returned. The plaintiffs' expert then assumed that warranty repairs would cost 20% of the original labour and material costs. Mr. Preston accepted that estimate in default of the defendants providing any more adequate assessment. In the circumstances, this approach cannot be faulted.
[37]
The defendant attempted to establish what it calls ancillary direct costs, based on a method of global calculation which contains many uncertainties and is speculative in many respects. Mr. Preston accepted the plaintiffs' analysis of the defendant's records and based his recommendation on that approach. I have not been persuaded that the allocations which he made should be altered.
(b) Common Costs
[38]
Common costs can be classified as fixed, variable or semi-variable. With respect to fixed costs, these, by definition, do not change with the production and sale of the infringing rowers. Thus, no amount of such costs are to be attributed to the infringing rowers. With respect to variable costs, the parties agree on the method of calculation which should be used. The amount of such costs should be determined by using a sales ratio (sales of rowers to total sales of the Homeware Division). That sales ratio is applied to variable common costs to determine the amount which should be allocated as a cost of the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers.
[39]
In the case of semi-variable costs, there is considerable difference between the parties as to the method of calculation which should be used. The plaintiffs' expert proposed, and Mr. Preston accepted, that the fixed component of a semi-variable cost should be identified and subtracted. Then, the sales ratio, referred to above, should be applied to the remaining variable component. The defendant proposed a different approach. Mr. Wiener used 1984 as a base year and then measured the increase or decrease in expenses for the subsequent three years relative to 1984. Increased expenses in those years were then prorated between infringing and noninfringing products sold by Homeware.
[40]
In 1985, the sales of noninfringing products decreased from 1984, whereas the sales of infringing products, as compared to 1984, increased. Therefore, Mr. Wiener concluded that the increase in expenses in 1985 as compared to 1984 were wholly attributable to sales of infringing units. Thus, 100% of the increase in semi-variable expenses were attributed to convertible rowers for that year. In 1986 and 1987, using 1984 as the base year, sales of the Homeware Division, excluding convertible rowers, increased as did the sales of convertible rowers. For those years, Mr. Wiener allocated a percentage increase in expenses, attributable to the infringing rowers, by reference to the criteria mentioned above. This led to an allocation of 54.97% and 16.25% of the increased expenses for the 1986 and 1987 years, to the infringing rowers. The defendant's method of cost allocation leads to an amount of $685,185.00 being attributable as common costs relating to the manufacture and sale of the convertible rowers. Mr. Preston allowed $298,422.00.
[41]
Mr. Preston's allocation was based largely on the plaintiffs' representations respecting the appropriate approach. He rejected the defendant's proposed method in the following terms:
"He [Mr. Justice Addy in the Teledyne decision] then stated:
'... a reasonable method of calculating the "profit" from the sales of the infringing shower heads of the defendant, is to reduce the sales revenue of those shower heads by:
(a) the variable expenses directly attributable to those shower heads; and
(b) any increase in fixed expenses attributable to those shower heads.'
"It is my opinion that in this case that is what Mr. Belbeck [the plaintiff's expert] is endeavouring to do. In his calculations of increase in the common cost, he has considered, insurance, taxes, some related depreciation, advertising, shipping salaries and expenses, express and cartage and truck expenses for a total allowance of $216,056.00.
"Mr. Wiener, ... as well as allowing all of the above mentioned common expenses has taken rent, machinery repairs and maintenance, factory expense, commissions, selling and travel, design expense, office salaries and expense, postage, telephone and telegram, bad debts, payroll charges, sales discounts and bank interest and has allowed a percentage of the whole expense to be attributable to the production of the convertible rowers. In doing this, without directly linking the expense to the production of the infringing units, he is giving an allocation diametrically opposed to the reasoning of Addy, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  expenses, both variable and fixed, which actually contributed to the sums received and for which he is liable to account. It follows that no part or proportion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing operation not taken place, is to be considered as deductible.'"
[42]
With respect to the semi-variable costs, the defendant argues that it is very difficult to isolate the fixed portion of such costs from the variable component. Therefore, the base year approach should be accepted as a reasonable method of calculating the expenses. In my view, Mr. Preston was correct in rejecting that submission. The accounting of a defendant's profit will necessarily be somewhat inexact, whatever method of assessment is chosen. As between the defendant's approach and the plaintiffs', it is clear that, the latter results in a closer approximation to what is required for the purposes of an accounting of profits, in the present case, than does the former. In addition, there is no expert evidence that the defendant's method of calculating the share of semi-variable costs is an accepted accounting method.
[43]
While counsel continually argued that it was impossible to do what the differential accounting approach required, in order to obtain a reasonable estimate of actual costs, no convincing expert accounting evidence was adduced to substantiate that position. Indeed, Mr. Belbeck when questioned about the allocation of common costs relating to postage stated:
"The external financial statements of a particular company would never give the information you'd need to do that. However, if access was given to all the books and records of a particular company you could reconstruct how much was incurred for postage of particular products. It would be a long and tedious job and I did not have the information available to me to make that allocation." (transcript page 263)
[44]
The plaintiff's expert, Mr. Belbeck, attempted some allocation of common costs, working from the financial statements and general ledgers but with respect to many categories of expense, he did not allocate any amount. He did not feel he had enough information available to do so. In this case of "factory expenses", for example, Mr. Belbeck wrote, at page 19 of his affidavit:
"The defendant has not provided any explanation or proof as to what expenses were grouped under this common cost expense within the general ledger, and we can only conclude that there was no increase in costs as a result of production of the infringing units."
The defendant, during the reference, through Mr. Nadler, provided some explanation of this category of expense but no attempt was made to identify the fixed cost component thereof. It is clear from Mr. Nadler's evidence that a significant portion, if not all, of the expenses covered by this category were not incurred in order to produce the infringing rowers. He described the heading as a "catch-all" category which accumulates all the costs of running the factory - "a multitude of different things". He gave as an example "if the furnace broke down in the building it would go under factory expense".
[45]
Mr. Preston was faced with the need to do an accounting based on Mr. Belbeck's, admittedly, incomplete analysis which relied on the financial statements and general ledgers of the defendant, or an accounting based on the defendant's base year approach, which approach Mr. Preston had rejected. In such circumstances it would be a mistake to parse his accounting too closely. The disposition made with respect to the specific cost categories will be discussed.
[46]
The parties agreed that the following variable common costs would have increased as a result of the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers: insurance and taxes, commissions, shipping salaries, shipping expenses, express and cartage, truck expenses. A proportion of those costs was attributed to the rowers, on the basis of the sales ratio described above. As noted, both parties agree that if a differential accounting approach is used, this is appropriate for variable costs.
[47]
With respect to two items of variable costs, bad debts and sales discounts, Mr. Preston did not apply the sales ratio. He took the position that the amount of bad debts which had arisen from the sale of infringing rowers could be specifically ascertained by the defendant from its invoices. Since the defendant had chosen not to attempt to make such a determination, no amount was allocated as an expense under this heading. Similarly in the case of sales discounts, Mr. Preston took the position that the amounts in question could have been specifically determined, had the defendant chosen to do so. Since it chose not to do so, no amount was allowed.
[48]
Two categories of cost, tax on capital and advertising, were treated by Mr. Preston, on the advice of Mr. Belbeck, as variable and an amount was allowed based on the sales ratio. The defendant argues that these are semivariable not variable costs and that the base year approach should be used with respect to them. I will set out some of Mr. Belbeck's evidence in this regard:
"... I have attempted to the extent possible to allocate the advertising expense which I believe to be variable on the basis of an activity level that would be tied to advertising.
. . . . .
"I think that implicitly a best estimate requires some evidence of what the expense includes. For these particular categories where I made an allocation I can be reasonably certain that they are variable with production and sale."
In the circumstances, Mr. Preston's acceptance of Mr. Belbeck's estimate is reasonable.
[49]
Mr. Belbeck recommended that no common costs be allocated to the infringing rowers on account of rent, machinery repairs and maintenance, factory expenses and depreciation. This recommendation was based on his view, at the time he prepared his affidavit, that the defendant had not demonstrated that any increase in these costs had occurred as a result of the production and sale of the infringing rowers. With respect to rent, Mr. Preston allocated $12,366.00 as a cost attributable to the rowers. He was persuaded, on the basis of the defendant's evidence, produced on the reference, that additional warehouse space had been leased in 1986 and that this had been required because of the production of the infringing rowers. With respect to machinery repairs and maintenance, as well as factory expenses, no amounts were allowed by Mr. Preston. Mr. Preston's decision is based on his finding that the defendant had not demonstrated that there had been any increase in these costs attributable to the production of the infringing rowers.
[50]
With respect to depreciation, I first of all note that the "depreciation" category is one Mr. Belbeck took from the financial statements of the defendant company. He describes this category of expense as a "book depreciation charge" which:
"is an allocation between the periods of capital costs that were incurred and are expected to benefit the company over a duration of several different periods.
"So in that respect, it does not vary unless any expenses or any capital expenditures are subsequently made and in this case, I'm not aware of any capital expenditures specifically for the infringing rowers so I would classify the expense as being fixed for this exercise. I'm not sure if any of the dies or patterns are capitalized. If they are, then presumably that would be reflected in an increased appreciation charge but if the cuts, dies and patterns are accounted for separately then there's no need to adjust the depreciation of them." (transcript p. 223)
[51]
Mr. Preston's accounting with respect to depreciation is a bit puzzling. He allocated under that heading a cost of $2400.00. This is the full cost of a strapping machine which he found to have been acquired by the defendant as a result of its production and sale of the convertible rowers. One can ask why he did not merely assess a depreciation percentage, or why he did not account for the machine's resale value at the end of the production period. In any event, the plaintiff is not contesting this allocation and therefore I am not prepared to depart from what Mr. Preston has recommended. I would note that the defendant put before Mr. Preston, a great quantity of evidence respecting a large number of machines which it alleged had been purchased for the purpose of manufacturing the infringing rowers. Mr. Preston saw and heard this evidence. He did not accept it.
[52]
With respect to three items (selling and travel expenses, office salaries and payroll charges) no amounts were allocated because there was no proof that increased costs had been incurred as attributable to the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers. Mr. Preston did, however, allocate part of the salary of a salesman, a Mr. Dubé, to the infringing rowers. He found that Mr. Dubé had been hired primarily to sell the rowers in Quebec. He therefore allowed $50,000.00 as a proper cost in this regard. With respect to office expenses, postage and telephone and telegram expenses, the plaintiffs agree with the defendant that there would be costs under the headings attributable to the infringing rowers. However, since the defendant made no attempt to analyse these items in order to present some estimates concerning the fixed as apposed to the variable component, nothing was allowed by Mr. Preston.
[53]
Under the heading design expense, the defendant claimed $36,044.00. This was paid to outside personnel to prepare brochures and manuals on the exercise equipment sold by the Homeware Division. Since no attempt was made by the defendant to allocate this expense as between the convertible rowers and the other equipment, Mr. Preston simply allowed $20,000.00 as the cost attributable to the rowers.
[54]
The defendant claims bank interest, in the amount of $90,337.00 as a cost item. The loans are Tye-Sil's. Mr. Wiener would allocate a portion of those loans to the Homeware Division by reference to the percentage of capital employed by that Division. He would then apply his base year approach and allocate a portion of the interest on this amount to the convertible rowers (100% in 1985, 54.97% in 1986 and 16.25% in 1987). This would result in: interest of $6,984.00 being allocated as a cost of manufacturing and selling the rowers in 1985; $46,497.00 in 1986; and $36,856.00 in 1987.
[55]
The plaintiffs note that the defendant's treatment of the interest expense item gives surprising results. As between 1985 and 1987, the sales of infringing rowers decreased by 30%, yet the defendant's method of cost assessment would allocate nearly a 600% increase in interest expense to 1987 over 1985. Similarly infringing rower sales decreased from 1986 to 1987, by approximately 30%, but the interest sought to be charged shows no comparable reduction. Mr. Belbeck's evidence with respect to bank interest was:
"This is a common cost but there is no proof that there was any increase in this cost specifically related to manufacture and sale of the infringing units. In fact, the increase in this expense from 1985 to 1987 appears to be partly due to operating losses in Tye-Sil's other divisions."
Mr. Preston allowed no cost allocation for bank interest. He concluded his report on common costs as follows:
"I have given an allowance for common costs that in my submission actually contributed to the sums received for the sale of the infringing units. The defendant was not able to prove to my satisfaction that any portion of the other common costs listed by its expert witness increased as a result of the production and sale of the infringing units. Because of this failure to prove, any doubt I may have, has been resolved in favour of the plaintiff."
[56]
As has already been noted, in the circumstances of this case, it would be a mistake to parse Mr. Preston's accounting too closely. He was faced with a defendant who based its representations on an approach to semivariable expenses which Mr. Preston, rightly, did not accept. In many instances it is clear that no attempt was made by the defendant to bring forward an analysis of cost based on actual documentation even when it existed. For the reasons given, Mr. Preston's accounting of the profits payable by the defendant to the plaintiffs will be confirmed.
Costs Of The Reference
[57]
Mr. Preston awarded the plaintiffs costs on a solicitor client basis, pursuant to rule 344(1), for two days preparation for discovery time and for two final days of discovery. He also allowed solicitor and client costs for one day of the reference, December 8, 1989.
[58]
The facts which gave rise to this decision are as follows. Mr. Justice Cullen, on November 30, 1987, ordered the defendant, within 30 days, to "provide the plaintiffs with a list of documents which sets out all documents in the defendant's possession or control which relate to its sales, costs and profits in respect of the infringing units". The defendant was required to provide such documents so "that the plaintiffs may examine the defendant on discovery in connection with the list of documents". In answer to this order a list of documents containing the documents, which the defendant considered relevant and on which they were going to rely was prepared and filed. At discovery, plaintiffs' counsel requested additional documents. In particular, Mr. Jolliffe asked for 1984 financial statements and documents in support of the purchase of specific equipment. These were refused on the ground that they were not relevant to the accounting of profits and the defendant was not relying on them.
[59]
During discovery, the defendant took the position that the full absorption method of accounting was appropriate. Much of the discussion in that proceeding related to the 10% and 12% surcharges which the defendant had added to the cost sheets after the July 30, 1987, decision of Mr. Justice Cullen. The plaintiffs sought to require the defendant to substantiate those amounts. Much of the documentation was refused, as I understand it, because the defendant took the position that a full absorption method of accounting was appropriate.
[60]
Mr. Wiener was subsequently hired. The expert affidavit which he eventually prepared for use on the reference before Mr. Preston, relied on the documentation which had been refused to the plaintiffs at discovery. That affidavit carries the date November 23, 1989. It also relied on a vast quantity of documentation that the plaintiffs had neither asked for nor seen before. During the hearing of the reference, the defendant sought to have these documents admitted into evidence. Mr. Preston refused. His reasons for this ruling are:
"The documents objected to by Mr. Jolliffe are documents that have been requested by Mr. Jolliffe on discovery. At that time their production was refused and counsel for the defendant stated that the reason for such refusal was that they were not going to rely on them. After Mr. Wiener was retained he indicated that he was going to approach the assessment of profits in a way that would necessitate the use of these documents.
"It is my opinion that at that time defendant's counsel should immediately have moved for the introduction of further documents, that up until that time counsel thought irrelevant.
"This would have put counsel for the plaintiff on notice in sufficient time if the motion had been successful to request further cross-examination and if necessary a short adjournment of the start of the reference, for that purpose.
"We are now in the fifth day of the reference and I am of the view, that it is now too late for a request for this production of this material to be made.
"In November 1987 the trial judge made an order directing the defendant within thirty days to provide the plaintiffs with a list of documents which sets out
all documents in the defendant's possession
or control which relate to its sales costs and profits in respect of the infringing units. In answer to this order a list of documents
containing only the documents, that in their opinion
, were related to the issues upon which they were going to rely on the reference dealing with the sales, costs and profits in respect of the infringing units was prepared and filed.
"At discovery plaintiffs' counsel renewed their request for all the documents covered by the order of the trial judge and supported their request with authorities showing that in a similar reference such documents were used.
"Mr. Wiener in his affidavit has taken the position that there are two approaches full cost and differential and for this purpose the documents he requires are those that had been originally requested by counsel for the plaintiff and refused.
"If immediately after this came to the attention of counsel for the defendant, even if only one week before the affidavit was filed, a motion for the filing of a supplementary list had been served on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would then have been on notice, before they were required to file, the expert affidavit of Mr. Belbeck, that the position taken by the defendant's counsel had changed. A request for an adjournment of the reference could have been then made if necessary. Further cross-examination could have been held of Mr. Nadler covering the new productions and the matters would have proceeded without any prejudice to the plaintiff.
"Mr. Garvis has referred me to rule 461 and two cases decided by Mr. Justice Mahoney. In the Moore Dry Kiln case the parties later found additional documents. That is not this case, the documents were in the defendant's possession and they stated that the documents were not going to be relied upon. This position having been relied upon by the plaintiffs. They proceed to prepare their case and their experts affidavit on that basis.
"The defendants having taken a position of refusing to produce documents that clearly should have been produced pursuant to the order of the trial judge dated November 30th, 1987, cannot now seek relief from rule 461.
"Associate Chief Justice Noel in his decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Denison's affidavit was prepared, it ought to have been mentioned in the list of documents which plaintiff had to supply to the expropriated party in accordance with rule 447(2) of this court'.
"Until yesterday counsel for the defendant took no step to introduce the productions now objected to into court for the purpose of this reference. It is my opinion that counsel for the defendants having maintained a position throughout it is now too late for another position to be introduced.
"For all of the above reasons I refuse the production at this time of any documents that were not relied on by the defendants on the discovery of Mr. Nadler."
[61]
The defendant indicated it intended to appeal that decision and requested an adjournment of the reference for that purpose. An adjournment was granted. The plaintiffs, not wishing to incur the delay such action would entail, withdrew their objection to the admission of the documents. At the same time, counsel reserved his right to speak to costs.
[62]
Mr. Preston subsequently awarded costs on a solicitor client basis for the days mentioned above. He gave reasons in the following terms:
"I now turn to the question of costs of this reference. Mr. Jolliffe argues that because the order of Cullen, J., was not complied with, part of the costs should be given to the plaintiff on a solicitor and client basis. Mr. Uditsky in his submission stated that if the defendant was at fault, it could only be from November when the defendant first became aware of the theory developed in Mr. Wiener's affidavit.
"In October 1989, a consent order was signed and for the first time the plaintiff was given access to the 1984 statement and general ledgers of the defendant. However it was not until the expert affidavit of Mr. Wiener was served that the plaintiffs' solicitor became aware of all the documents the defendant would be relying on. My ruling, at the time or the objection by Mr. Jolliffe to the acceptance of certain exhibits to Mr. Wiener's affidavit, disallowed the introduction of this new material. Mr. Jolliffe, however, waived his objection on the condition that he be allowed to discuss the question of costs relating to the discovery process and the documents in issue.
"I am of the opinion that, if the defendant had complied with the order of Cullen, J., relating to the production of a list of documents which set out all documents in the defendant's possession or control which relate to its sales, costs and profits in respect of the infringing units, discovery of the defendant would have concluded in two days. The usual undertakings would then have been answered and the case ready for reference. However, two additional days of discovery were held, the plaintiff still not able to procure records for 1984, the year the defendant commenced production of the infringing units.
"I submit that the plaintiffs should receive costs, on a solicitor and client basis, pursuant to rule 344(1) for two days' preparation for discovery time as well as for the two final days of discovery of the defendant. If all the documents had been produced it in my view these last two days of discovery would not have been necessary. I would also allow solicitor and client costs for December 8, 1989, the day the objection was made and argued by the plaintiffs' solicitor, to the documents, produced for the first time in the defendant experts affidavit. Subject to the above I submit the plaintiffs are entitled to their taxed costs of this reference on a party and party basis."
[63]
Counsel for the defendant objects to this award of costs. He argues that the defendant cannot be faulted for not having produced the documents prior to November 23, 1989. It was not until that date that the defendant's expert prepared his evidence and that the relevance of the documents in question surfaced. He argues that the discovery days were not wasted; they would have been required regardless of when the documents were produced. With respect to the solicitor client award for December 8, 1989, he argues that the plaintiffs should only be given one-half day because the reference resumed around 2 p.m. that afternoon, when the plaintiffs withdrew their objection to the introduction of the documents. The proceedings, apparently, had been adjourned late in the morning of the same day in response to the defendant's request for an adjournment.
[64]
Counsel for the plaintiffs points out that the documents, as well as comprising many which the plaintiffs had expressly asked for on discovery, comprised 60% of the documents relied upon by the defendant. They included documents such as the financial statements and general ledgers for 1984, the production cost sheets for the additional products (of the 70% best sellers) on which Mr. Wiener based his ancillary cost approach, auditors working papers for 1985, 1986 and 1987. Not only were the documents new to the plaintiffs but the concept of the defendant's argument, based as it was on the ancillary cost approach and the base year approach, was new to the plaintiffs.
[65]
Mr. Preston, having sat through the reference with all its detailed evidence is in a better position than I to judge the amount of discovery time wasted as a result of the defendant's conduct. Also, he is better able to judge how much time was wasted on December 8, 1989, as a result of the defendant's motion to have the documents admitted. I would note, however, that it is not only the time during which the reference was adjourned which would have been wasted in that proceeding. The time required for argument on the admissibility of the documents, the time required by Mr. Preston to prepare a ruling, as well as the subsequent request for and granting of an adjournment all were unnecessary procedures occasioned by the defendant's conduct.
[66]
Also, it is not sufficient to say there would have been discovery on the documents regardless of when they were produced. That may be, but the plaintiffs would likely have focused their discovery questions and organized their time in an entirely different way had they been made aware of the defendant's position at the beginning when it should have been disclosed. I have little difficulty accepting that discoveries, the production of expert affidavits and the plaintiffs' preparation of their case would have proceeded much more efficiently had the defendant conducted itself in a more organized fashion. In the circumstances, it is my view that Mr. Preston's award of costs was entirely reasonable.
Costs Of The Present Applications
[67]
Counsel for the plaintiffs brought an oral motion, at the end of the hearing of the present applications, seeking increased costs with respect to the present proceeding. To allow counsel for the defendant time to respond to such request, both counsel were asked to submit their representations on this issue, in writing.
[68]
The plaintiffs' motion is based on the fact that the appeal from Mr. Preston's report was complex, time consuming, detailed and required a review of much of the evidence which had been placed before Mr. Preston. Counsel argues that the defendant's solicitors defined the scope of the appeal in the broadest possible terms, by objecting to the Referee's Report in its general aspects as well as its details. He argues that the approach was to appeal virtually every significant finding of Mr. Preston, and to reargue the evidence again.
[69]
I accept counsel for the defendant's argument that references to fix damages or accounting of profits are usually lengthy and technical. Appeals from such are likely to be of a similar nature. I agree that this was known when the amendments were made to Tariff B in 1987 and yet no special provisions treating such appeals differently from other types of appeals when taxing costs were promulgated. I am mindful also that much of the argument presented to me was a repeat of what had been presented to Mr. Preston.
[70]
At the same time, I have been persuaded that the nature of this appeal is such, that an amount above that allowed by the tariff should be awarded with respect to preparation time. The plaintiffs' counsel prepared and filed a factum in response to the defendant's 80 page factum, which was more than 70 pages long. That factum necessarily dealt extensively with the facts which were in issue. A number of the issues, including ancillary costs, and various common costs, were commented on by virtually all witnesses, particularly King, Nadler, Wiener, Belbeck and Gayler. The evidence of each had to be isolated and compared to the other versions in preparation for the appeal. The plaintiffs had to deal with twenty-two issues. In addition, there was substantial argument on the law, including analysis of the case law respecting appeals from the Prothonotary.
[71]
Accordingly an increase in the tariff will be allowed with respect to the costs of preparation. Senior counsel will be allowed to claim up to $500.00 per day for each three and one-half days ($ 1750.00) and junior counsel will be entitled to claim up to $300.00 per day for each three and one-half days ($ 1050.00). I note that the defendant does not contest the plaintiffs' entitlement to reimbursement for all reasonable disbursements paid in respect of the hearing of the appeal in Montreal. In all other respects, the plaintiffs' request for increased costs is denied.
Order accordingly.

These surcharges were the subject of much discussion at the discovery stage. In the absence of the defendant being able to substantiate the expenses alleged, these were not included in the plaintiffs' calculations.
