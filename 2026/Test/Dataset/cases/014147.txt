Applicant
and
ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF CANADA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF SASKATCHEWAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NOVA

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NUNAVUT, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ATTORNEY

Respondents
ORDER AND REASONS
[1]
The Applicant filed a 31 page Notice of
Application on June 4, 2016, naming as Respondents the Attorney General of
Canada, the Attorneys General of Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Manitoba, Nunavut, British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon, and the Minister of
National Revenue.
[2]
The Notice of Application states that it is
brought “pursuant to s. 41 of the Access to Information
Act, “Act” re June 3, 2016 Information Commissioner Report re Minister of
National Revenue s. 10(2) Act (…)”, but that it is also brought “pursuant to 18.1(a,b) 57 Federal Courts Act, 64 Federal
Courts Rules, s. 42(1a) Canada Revenue Agency “CRA” Act, s. 24 Charter right to
remedy for s. 12 Charter breach (…)” followed by a further list of
disjointed references to other legislative provisions.
[3]
The Application seeks the following relief:
Declaratory relief that s. 10(2) Access to Information Act shall
read “in a case of safety, security, criminal law, economic interest” after
words “may but is not required”, in alternative, s 10(2) Privacy Act shall be
read down, the Attorney General shall have 12 months to cure inconsistency, AND
provincial Attorney Generals for Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Manitoba, Nunavut, of British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon shall remedy any legislation
that regulates access to information gathered as a result of an s57 Federal
Courts Act notice, AND pursuant to s39 Act “Commissioner may… make a special
report to Parliament” on s10(2).
[4]
On July 25, 2016, the Applicant served and filed
a motion record on a motion to amend his Notice of Application “to include relief re July 4, 2016 report of the Information
Commissioner” and other relief. This motion was made for determination
in writing, pursuant to Rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules.
[5]
On August 3, 2016, the Respondents Attorney
General of Canada and Minister of National Revenue (hereafter referred to
simply as “the Attorney General”), filed a motion record on a motion to strike
the Application. That motion was also made for determination in writing pursuant
to Rule 369. On August 4, 2016, the Attorney General served a responding record
to the Applicant’s motion to amend, as well as amended written representations
on its motion to strike.
[6]
On August 5, 2016, the Applicant filed a
response to the Attorney General’s motion to strike (“Reply
to Respondent Motion to Strike served on August 4, 2016 around 3 pm”)
that appears to refer to and take into account the amended written
representations served August 4, 2016. The Applicant also served on August 5,
2016 an other motion record that appears to be a reply to the Attorney
General’s response to the Applicant’s motion to amend (“Motion
Record (Reply)”) and a document requesting that both the Applicant’s
motion to amend and the Attorney General’s motion to strike be heard
concurrently at the General Sittings in Ottawa on August 17, 2016.
[7]
The Attorney General filed its reply to the
Applicant’s responding record on August 8, 2016. It objects to an oral hearing.
[8]
Finally, the Applicant filed, on August 8, 2016,
a motion record on a motion “pursuant to rules 64, 54”
to be heard at the Ottawa General Sittings on August 17, 2016. That motion
appears to be a motion to strike the Attorney General’s motion to strike. A
document entitled “Supplementary Motion Record (August
17 Motion) Affidavit – Unprecedented Judicial Errors Against the Interest of
Juctice (sic)” was also filed by the Applicant on August 10, 2016. It is
unclear whether that supplementary motion record is in support of his latter
motion or to supplement his response to the Attorney General’s motion to
strike.
[9]
The first matter to be determined is whether the
Applicant’s motion to amend and the Attorney General’s motion to strike should
be heard orally, as requested by the Applicant, or determined on the basis of
the written record.
[10]
I have considered the reasons why the Court
might order an oral hearing of a written motion as set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as well as the reasons set out in the Applicant’s
August 5 request. The Applicant’s argument that the issues raise “quasi-constitutional right of access for over 30 million
Canadians” is without any apparent merit, as is his assertion that the
Attorney General “has a rich history of falsehoods in
court and abuse of process”. While the Applicant’s written materials are
prolix, difficult to understand and at times incoherent, the issues raised in
the motions themselves are straightforward and the Court would derive no
benefit from an oral hearing.
[11]
I intend to consider first the Applicant’s
motion to amend his Notice of Application.
[12]
The Notice of Application initiating this
application, filed July 4, 2016, specifically invokes the Federal Court’s
jurisdiction to review a refusal of access pursuant to s 41 of the Access to
Information Act RSC 1985 c A-1 (“ATIA”). The refusal identified in
the original Notice of Application concerns the Applicant’s request for records
of certain telephone calls to or from a certain CRA employee, and CRA’s
response that no such records were found. The Information Commissioner’s report
of investigation dated June 3, 2016, pursuant to which the application purports
to be instituted, concluded that no such records existed. As mentioned, the
Notice of Application also seeks various declaratory reliefs in respect of the
interpretation and application of s 10(2) of the ATIA.
[13]
The motion to amend has two distinct purposes.
First, it seeks to include a prayer for relief in respect of a second report of
the information Commissioner, dated July 4, 2016. That report relates to a
request for information relating to the training attended and audits performed
by a different CRA employee. The CRA’s refusal in respect of that request was
not based on the non-existence of records but on an exemption under subsection
19(1) of the ATIA. The grounds the Applicant proposes to raise in an
amended notice of application are entirely separate and distinct from those
raised in the original Notice of Application.
[14]
Without pronouncing on or considering the merits
of the original application or of the proposed amendments, it is obvious that
there is no commonality between the original application and the proposed
additions other than the fact that they relate to access to information
requests made to the CRA. The motion to amend is essentially a motion to
consolidate in the existing application an application that could and, if it
has any merit, should have been the subject of a distinct application.
Amendments may be permitted where they would help determine the real question
in controversy, where they would not create an injustice that cannot be
compensated by costs and where it would serve the interest of justice ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Adding a new and unrelated application for review
to the existing application would clearly distract from, rather than assist in,
determining any question in controversy in the first application. There is no
basis to permit the Applicant to amend so as to effect a de facto consolidation
of a new and separate application into an existing application. To do so is to
invite litigants to use applications as a pipeline in which to funnel any and
all grievances they may have against a respondent as they arise, whether or not
they are related, and is clearly not in the interest of justice.
[15]
The second purpose of the amendment is to add
arguments in respect of a bill to amend Saskatchewan’s access to information
legislation. It is plain and obvious that this Court has no jurisdiction over
provincial legislatures or legislation and that the proposed amendments cannot
form the basis of any arguable case.
[16]
The Court notes that in his reply submissions,
the Applicant proposes yet further amendments to his Notice of Application.
None addresses or cures the flaws identified above. The Applicant’s motion to
amend is, accordingly, dismissed.
[17]
I now turn to the Attorney General’s motion to
strike.
[18]
To the extent the application is an application
pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA for judicial review of the CRA’s refusal to
disclose the telephone records requested, I am satisfied that it is plain and
obvious that it cannot succeed. Our Court has made it clear on a number of
occasions that where, in response to a request for information (whether under
the ATIA or the Privacy Act, RSC 1985 c P-21), a department
responds that a record does not exist, such a response does not constitute a
refusal of access. Absent a refusal, the Court does not have jurisdiction in
judicial review pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA or the Privacy Act,
unless there is some evidence, beyond mere suspicion, that records do exist and
have been withheld.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[19]
As mentioned, it is plain that the “refusal”
here is based on the CRA’s conclusion that no records such as those requested
exist, and the Information Commissioner’s report of investigation agrees with
that conclusion. No evidence, or even cogent argument, has been submitted by
the Applicant to support a conclusion that the records exist or are being
withheld. It is plain and obvious that this Court can have no jurisdiction in
this matter pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA.
[20]
To the extent the Notice of Application is an
application for a declaration pursuant to s 18.1 of the Federal Courts
Act, I am also satisfied that it is plain and obvious that it cannot
succeed. The application takes issue with s 10(2) of the ATIA, which
reads as follows:
10 (1) Where
the head of a government institution refuses to give access to a record
requested under this Act or a part thereof, the head of the institution
shall state in the notice given under paragraph 7(a)
(a) that the record does not exist, or
(b) the specific provision of this Act on which the refusal was
based or, where the head of the institution does not indicate whether a
record exists, the provision on which a refusal could reasonably be expected
to be based if the record existed,
and shall state
in the notice that the person who made the request has a right to make a
complaint to the Information Commissioner about the refusal.
(2) The head of a government institution may but is not
required to indicate under subsection (1) whether a record exists.
10 (1) En cas de
refus de communication totale ou partielle d’un document demandé en vertu
de la présente loi, l’avis prévu à l’alinéa 7a) doit mentionner, d’une
part, le droit de la personne qui a fait la demande de déposer une plainte
auprès du Commissaire à l’information et, d’autre part :
a) soit le fait que le document n’existe pas;
b) soit la disposition précise de la présente loi sur laquelle se
fonde le refus ou, s’il n’est pas fait état de l’existence du document, la
disposition sur laquelle il pourrait vraisemblablement se fonder si le
document existait.
(2) Le paragraphe (1) n’oblige pas le responsable de l’institution
fédérale à faire état de l’existence du document demandé.
[Emphasis added.]
[21]
Although difficult to follow and at times
incoherent, the Notice of Application appears to argue that the ability of
government departments to rely on s 10(2) of the ATIA to refuse to
indicate whether or not documents exist breaches s 12 of the Charter of
Rights and Freedoms and other legislative provisions, because it somehow
allows them to hide evidence. The sole relief sought is the above mentioned
declaration as to how s 10(2) should be read, an order that the Attorney
General “cure” the inconsistency within 12 months, that the Attorneys General
of the named provinces and territories “remedy” their corresponding
legislations and that the Information Commissioner make a special report to
Parliament on s 10(2) of the ATIA.
[22]
First, it is abundantly clear that this Court
has no jurisdiction in respect of the relief sought against the Attorneys
General of the provinces and territories
[23]
With respect to the declaration sought as to the
manner in which s 10(2) of the ATIA should be read and applied, the
fatal flaw is that the remedy is purely theoretical. The declaration does not
flow from the review of any decision, order or action of a federal board,
commission or other tribunal. The CRA’s answer to the Applicant’s request for
access expressly stated that the records did not exist, and accordingly plainly
did not invoke the application of s 10(2) of the ATIA. Neither the CRA’s
response to the request for access nor the Information Commissioner’s
investigation and report engaged the application of s 10(2) of the ATIA.
The Court’s jurisdiction pursuant to s 18 and 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act
to grant relief “against any federal board, commission
or other tribunal” or in respect of a decision or order of a federal
board, commission or other tribunal cannot therefore be invoked or engaged in
the circumstances. I have noted that the Notice of Application alleges that the
Information Commissioner’s Report “shows that for about
3 years CRA has relied and is relying on s 10(2) to prevent the applicant from
receiving all the records to which he is entitled”. However, this
assertion is patently unsupported on the very face of the report on which it
purports to be based. I am satisfied that the Court’s jurisdiction in judicial
review is not properly engaged in this matter.
[24]
The Applicant invokes Rule 64 of the Federal
Courts Rules, to the effect that proceedings are not subject to challenge
on the ground that only a declaratory order is sought, and that the Court may
make a binding declaration of right in a proceeding whether or not any
consequential relief is or can be claimed. However, as found in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  citing  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the rule does not permit an applicant to simply
tack a constitutional challenge onto an improperly brought application. There
must be some basis on which the application is brought and not merely some
abstract desire to obtain clarification.
[25]
Given the conclusion above that the Notice of
Application cannot possibly succeed as an application pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA
or as a judicial review application, the request for declaratory relief of
unconstitutionality is a request for a bare declaration of unconstitutionality
without any factual foundation whatsoever and cannot succeed. This would be so
even if the Applicant had brought the proceeding as an action rather than an
application ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It
is plain and obvious that this is not one of these exceptional cases where
unconstitutionality can be determined as a pure question of law. Indeed, I note
that the Notice of Application purports to have some factual foundation, but
that that foundation is entirely made of serious, unfounded and speculative
allegations of fraud, cover-ups, discrimination and lies. In this respect, the
Notice of Application is also abusive, scandalous, frivolous and vexatious.
[26]
I am satisfied that the Notice of Application
should be struck because it is devoid of any chance of success whatsoever, and
further because it is abusive, scandalous and vexatious.
[27]
I note that none of the amendments proposed in
the Applicant’s motion to amend, in his reply to that motion or in his response
to the Attorney General’s motion to strike would cure the defects noted in
these reasons. I am also satisfied that no amendment could possibly cure these
defects, such that the application will be struck without leave to amend.
[28]
Given my determination that this application
should be struck without leave to amend, the Applicant’s motion filed August 8,
2016 is moot and will be dismissed. As mentioned earlier, this motion and the
supplementary record filed August 10, 2016 appear to argue that the Attorney
General’s motion to strike should be struck. If possible, this material is even
more incoherent and the allegations and accusations made therein even more
inflammatory and abusive than the Applicant’s previous submissions. To the
extent this material was intended to set out new grounds to dismiss or strike
the Attorney General’s motion to strike, these grounds should have been
included in the Applicant’s responding record. The Applicant’s attempt to put
these arguments before the Court in a supplementary record or in a motion
presentable orally, and after the Attorney General has filed its reply, is a
transparent attempt to bootstrap his request for an oral hearing of the motion
to strike, is abusive and should not be permitted.
[29]
Out of an abundance of caution, however, I have
considered these materials to attempt to discern whether they might contain any
reasonable defence to the motion to strike that might justify the Court hearing
the motion prior to dismissing the application. I have found nothing of merit.
ORDER
THIS COURT ORDERS that:
1.
The Applicant’s motion to amend is dismissed;
2.
The motion of the Attorney General of Canada and
of the Minister of National Revenue to strike the Notice of Application is
granted;
3.
The Notice of Application is struck, without
leave to amend;
4.
The Applicant’s motion pursuant to Rules 64 and
54 made returnable on August 17, 2016 is dismissed as moot;
5.
Costs of the motion to strike shall be payable
by the Applicant to the Respondents Attorney General of Canada and Minister of
National Revenue, in the amount of $1100.
