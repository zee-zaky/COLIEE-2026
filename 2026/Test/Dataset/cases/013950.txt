Kelen, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence as a Québec investor on the grounds that the visa officer was not satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible to Canada. The applicant is a businessman in China, and the visa officer is based in Hong Kong.
Background
The applicant's application under the Quebec investor category
[2]
The applicant, Mr. Wei Biao Chen, is a citizen and resident of China. In June 2002, he applied to the Province of Québec for a nomination under the Québec investor category. After attending an interview with the Service d'immigration du Québec (the Service), he received a letter from the Service advising that he did not meet the definition of the investor class under the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
(the
Regulations
). The Service advised the applicant that the letter would be considered a refusal unless he submitting the following documentation to the Service within 60 days:
"An explanation from an accountant in relation to the amounts of 3.7 and 2.35 million RMB [renminbi] shown under 'Other Payables' and with respect to the revolving fund set up under the chengbao [sub-contract agreement] of 1996."
The applicant submitted the requested information and, on March 29, 2004, the province of Québec issued the applicant a selection certificate.
[3]
In conjunction with his application for selection under the Quebec investor category, the applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada under the investor immigrant category. As part of his application, the applicant submitted material regarding his assets in order to prove that he legally obtained a net worth of at least $800,000 in accordance with the
Regulations
. This material included:
1. a notarized "CHENGBAO" contract (sub-contract agreement) signed between the applicant and Guang Dong You He Trade with Taiwan Trading Company (the Trading Company);
2. a translated copy of the 1996 purchase agreement for the sale of property located at 10th Street Clifford Estate (the Property);
3. a receipt confirming the method, manner and amount of payment for the Property;
4. the applicant's sworn statement regarding the source of his funds;
5. submissions on behalf of the applicant dated March 30, 2005;
6. various business contracts entered into by the applicant on behalf of the Trading Company;
7. notarized corporate tax receipts;
8. a tax certificate confirming the Trading Company's payments to the local tax bureau for the period from March 1996 to December 2002;
9. bank statements for the Trading Company issued by the Bank of China for the period from 1999 to 2002;
10. an audit report prepared for the Trading Company for the period from 1996 to 2002;
11. a chart of the Trading Company's profits and losses for the period from 1996 to 2002; and
12. the Trading Company's balance sheets for the period from 1996 to 2002.
[4]
The applicant attended an interview with a visa officer from the Hong Kong Immigration Section of the Canadian Consulate General on November 17, 2005. By letter dated the next day, the visa officer refused the applicant's application for permanent residence. The letter stated in part:
"Subsections 34 to 42 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 2001
prescribe inadmissible classes of persons to Canada. In order for your application to succeed, you must satisfy me that you meet all the requirements of
IRPA
and the regulations, including a determination that you are not a member of an inadmissible class of persons described in subsections 34 to 42.
Your failure to adequately account for the origins of your net worth makes it impossible for me to complete a comprehensive and proper assessment of admissibility in your case.
Subsection 16(1) of the
Act
requires that a person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonable requires.
You do not meet these requirements because you have not complied with my requests for evidence to satisfy me that your personal net worth was derived from legal and legitimate sources.
Subsection 11(1) of the
Act
provides that a foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this
Act
.
Based on the information that is available,
I am not satisfied that you are not inadmissible and that you meet the requirements of the
Act
for the reasons explained above
. I am therefore not authorized to issue you a permanent reside visa. Your application is therefore refused." (Emphasis added)
[5]
The visa officer's concerns about the legality of the source of the applicant's funds are identified throughout the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes:
1. The visa officer questioned the source of the applicant's funds with which he purchased the Property in 1996. The visa officer observed that the purchase price was RMB 509,652 and that the applicant earned RMB 421,400 from 1984 to 1996.
2. According to the chengbao sub-contract agreement between the applicant and the Trading Company, the applicant bore responsibility for providing a revolving fund. The visa officer opined that the applicant could not have operated the chengbao without start-up funds.
3. The applicant previously stated to the Bureau d'immigration du Québec that the revolving fund for the chengbao came from the applicant's own savings and from credit extended to him by a Hong Kong supplier.
4. It was not feasible for the applicant to make a substantial payment towards the purchase price of the Property while operating a chengbao which required start-up funds.
5. The purchase contracts submitted by the applicant did not contain accurate telephone numbers and listings for the contracting companies. In fact, three of these contracts were found by the respondent to be fraudulent.
Issues
[6]
This application for judicial review raises the following issues:
1. Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?
2. Did the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?
3. Did the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?
Standard of Review
[7]
The case law is divided as to the appropriate standard of review applicable to visa officers' decisions. In some cases, the Court has determined that patent unreasonableness is the appropriate standard: see, e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In others, the Court has applied a standard of reasonableness: see, e.g.,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170. As stated by Linden, J.A., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
"¶ 46 ... [T]he pragmatic and functional analysis must be undertaken anew by the reviewing Court with respect to each decision of an administrative decision-maker, not merely each general type of decision of a particular decision-maker under a particular provision."
[9]
Having regard to the absence of a privative clause or absolute right of appeal, the availability of judicial review upon leave of the Court, a visa officer's relative expertise in assessing applications for permanent residence visas, the polycentric context within which decisions are made under the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27, and the nature of the decision under review as a question of mixed fact and law, I conclude that the visa officer's decision on questions of fact is appropriately reviewed on a standard of patent unreasonableness.
[10]
With respect to the issue of procedural fairness, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that questions of procedural fairness or natural justice are subject to the correctness standard:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 201, at paragraph 65. If a breach of the duty of fairness is found, the decision must be set aside: see, e.g.,
Congrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 665. Questions of law like jurisdiction are also reviewed on a standard of correctness.
Relevant Legislation
[11]
The following legislation and inter-provincial agreements govern this application:
1. the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the
Act
), the relevant excerpts of which are set out in Appendix "A" to these Reasons;
2.
An Act Respecting Immigration to Québec
,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the issuance of selection certificates to qualified immigrants wishing to settle in the Province of Québec. The relevant excerpts of this legislation are set out in Appendix "B" to these Reasons; and
3. the
Canada-Québec Accord Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens
, dated February 5, 1991, which assigns responsibility for the selection of qualified immigrants to Québec. The relevant excerpts of this agreement are set out in Appendix "C" to these Reasons.
Analysis
Issue No. 1
: Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?
[12]
The Hong Kong Immigration Section of the respondent conducted an investigation of the applicant's Hong Kong clients to confirm their business relationship with the applicant. The verification was specifically with respect to six contracts which the applicant had submitted to verify his business, source of funds and capital. The verification result was that three of the six contracts were flagged with a "FRAUD" warning. This verification report was completed on July 7, 2005.
[13]
On cross-examination, the visa officer admitted that the fraud reports were not disclosed to the applicant prior to the interview on November 17, 2005, which was the day before the visa officer's decision. Moreover, it is clear that not all the fraud reports were discussed at the interview, the applicant was never shown the reports, and the applicant was not given even one day to respond to the verbal rendition by the visa officer of the "verification results" indicating "fraud".
[14]
The duty to act fairly requires the visa officer to allow the applicant an opportunity to respond to any central concern, inconsistency or extrinsic evidence with respect to the application: see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Pinard, J., at paragraph 15. The applicant was not given the opportunity to know that the verification result showed that three of six contracts investigated were found to be coloured with "FRAUD". The manner in which the visa officer raised this issue at the interview did not provide the applicant with a proper opportunity to know the case against him with respect to important extrinsic evidence against his application, or a proper opportunity to respond.
[15]
In
Shi
, above, Justice Snider considered a similar fact scenario at paragraphs 20 and 21 where the respondent sent a "fairness letter" to a Chinese applicant for immigration to Canada as an Investor in the Business Category selected by the Province of Québec:
"¶ 20 In a fairness letter dated October 5, 2004, the visa officer advised Mr. Shi of the fraudulent certificate and allowed him 30 days to respond. The relevant portion of that letter reads as follows:
'Following a review of your application for permanent residence in Canada, our office made telephone inquiries to verify tax documentation provided in support of your application. The verification uncovered serious discrepancies in the information submitted with your application and these call into question the authenticity of your accumulation of your personal net wealth.
Specifically, our office discovered that the tax document purported to be issued by the Shenyang Local Tax Bureau Helping Branch is fraudulent …
The result of the verification suggests that you have submitted a false document. Misrepresentation such as this may result in the refusal of your application.'
"¶ 21 In response to this letter, Mr. Shi denied that the certificate was not genuine and produced photo copies of tax receipts which, when added, corresponded to the 2000 total tax paid on the certificate in question."
[16]
In the case at bar, the visa officer did not send Mr. Chen any "fairness letter" giving him knowledge of the findings of fraud against him, or a proper opportunity to respond. This is an obvious breach of the duty of fairness owed to the applicant, and warrants the intervention of the Court on this basis alone. For this reason, the Court will:
1. allow this application;
2. set aside the decision of the visa officer;
3. expect Mr. Chen to respond to the results of the fraud verification report by sending the Hong Kong visa office more information to prove the legitimacy of those contracts and to better explain the legitimacy of his source of funds; and
4. expect a different visa officer to then redetermine the application for a visa in a reasonably expeditious manner having regard to the delays experienced on this file.
[17]
Accordingly, the Court does not need to consider the other two issues raised by the applicant. However, in obiter, I will briefly express my opinion on these other two issues for the benefit of the parties.
Issue No. 2:
Did the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?
[18]
Paragraph 9(1)(a) of the
Act
provides that the applicant shall be granted permanent resident status because he met the Québec selection criteria as an investor immigration unless found inadmissible. The visa officer did not find the applicant inadmissible; rather, the visa officer said he could not be "satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible". This is not a finding that the applicant is inadmissible. If the visa officer concluded that Mr. Chen was not truthfully answering questions about his source of funds as required under s. 16 of the
Act
, the visa officer could have found Mr. Chen inadmissible under ss. 40 or 41 of the
Act
. He did not do so, and did not have the jurisdiction to deny a permanent resident visa to Mr. Chen under paragraph 9(1)(a) of the
Act
.
Issue No. 3:
Did the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?
[19]
The visa officer clearly misunderstood the evidence before the Québec immigration officer and erroneously found that there was a contradiction in Mr. Chen's evidence about his initial working capital. Since the visa officer relied upon this misunderstanding to find that Mr. Chen could not have had the working capital in 1996 required under the chengbao contract or the capital to buy a house in 1996, this misunderstanding resulted in a patently unreasonable finding of fact.
Costs
[20]
At the hearing, the applicant sought for the first time legal costs under Rule 22 of the
Federal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules
, SOR/93-22.
[21]
The Rule for immigration judicial review applications is that no costs shall be awarded to or against any party unless the court so orders for "special reasons". In this case, the respondent has acted in good faith without any undue delay. The applicant knew the legitimacy of his funds (C$800,000) was an important issue. The applicant should have presented his source of funds in a manner which clearly shows they are legitimate. The applicant did not do so, and now, as a result of his Federal Court case, he has a second chance. However, I do not think the respondent's conduct in this case constitutes special reasons for awarding costs.
Certified Question
[22]
The Court is satisfied that this case does not raise a serious issue of general importance which ought to be certified with respect to procedural fairness. The determinative issue concerning procedural fairness is obvious and not of general importance. The other two issues, being obiter, are not determinative.
JUDGMENT
[23]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
:
1. The application for judicial review is allowed;
2. The visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence is set aside and remitted for reconsideration by a different visa officer after the applicant has submitted additional information to respond to the results of the fraud verification and any other information which the applicant wishes to submit to verify the legitimacy of his funds (i.e. C$800,000).
Application allowed.

Process.
The Minister shall process the application, having regard to the annual immigration plan and to the order of priorities prescribed by regulation.
Selection certificate.
The Minister shall issue a selection certificate to the foreign national who meets the conditions and criteria of selection determined by regulation.
Suspension of examination.
The Minister shall suspend the examination of applications or cease to issue selection certificates for or within a class until the beginning of the following calendar year if the maximum set out in the annual plan has been reached.

(Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, chapter I-2), or in any other case where the Minister considers that the results obtained following the application of the selection criteria do not reflect whether or not the foreign national will be able to become successfully established  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Conversely, the Minister may refuse to issue such a certificate to a foreign national who meets the conditions and criteria of selection if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national does not intend to settle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or is unlikely to settle successfully  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or that the settlement of the foreign national would be contrary to public interest."
"
Ressortissant étranger permanent.
3.1. Un ressortissant étranger désirant s'établir à titre permanent au Québec doit, sauf pour les catégories ou dans les cas prévus par règlement, présenter une demande de certificat de sélection au ministre des Relations avec les citoyens et de l'Immigration conformément à la procédure visée au paragraphe f de l'article 3.3.
Demande examinée.
Le ministre examine la demande en tenant compte du plan annuel d'immigration et de l'ordre des priorités fixé par règlement.

Atteinte du maximum.
Le ministre suspend l'examen des demandes ou cesse de délivrer des certificats de sélection pour une catégorie ou à l'intérieur d'une même catégorie jusqu'au début de l'année civile suivante, si le maximum prévu au plan annuel est atteint. Il peut, pour une catégorie ou à l'intérieur d'une même catégorie, suspendre l'examen des demandes ou cesser la délivrance des certificats de sélection jusqu'au début de l'année civile suivante, s'il est d'avis que le maximum ou l'estimation prévu au plan annuel sera atteint.

À l'inverse, le ministre peut refuser de délivrer un tel certificat à celui qui satisfait aux conditions et critères de sélection s'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire que le ressortissant étranger n'a pas l'intention de s'établir au Québec, n'a que peu de possibilités de s'y établir avec succès ou dont l'établissement irait à l'encontre de l'intérêt public."

Regulation respecting the selection of foreign nationals, c. I-0.2, r.5
[as of March 29, 2004]
"
2. Procedure for obtaining a selection and acceptance certificate
2. The application for a selection certificate referred to in s. 3.1 of the Act is filed with the Minister by a foreign national for himself and for his family members whether or not they accompany him ; the application for a certificate of acceptance referred to in s. 3.2 of the Act is filed with the Minister by a foreign national for himself and for his accompanying family members.
