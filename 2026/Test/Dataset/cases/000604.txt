Martin, J.
: This is an appeal by Humpty Dumpty Foods Limited, the applicant for registration of the proposed use trademark "Amigos" in association with its "extruded cornmeal snack food", from the November 30, 1987, decision of the Chairman of the Trademarks Opposition Board refusing to allow its application on the grounds that on the date of filing the statement of opposition by the respondent, namely August 21, 1985, the proposed mark lacked distinctiveness.
[2]
On October 31, 1984, the appellant applied to register the trademark "Amigos" for proposed use in association with its cornmeal snack food. The application was assigned number 530862.
[3]
On November 13, 1984, the respondent made a similar application, assigned number 531414, for the trademark "Amigo" in connection with a similar snack food. On May 10, 1985, in response to the respondent's application, the Trademarks Office informed the respondent that:
"Having regard to the provisions of s. 16 of the Act, the applicant herein does not appear to be the person entitled to registration in view of the copending and confusing application No. 530862 particulars of which are attached."
[4]
Following the advertisement of the appellant's application in the Trade Marks Journal on July 24, 1985, the respondent, on August 21, 1985, filed a notice of opposition objecting to the allowance of the appellant's application on the sole ground that the proposed trademark "Amigos" was not distinctive. The grounds of the respondent's opposition were as follows:
"(a) The trademark 'Amigos' is not distinctive of the applicant's wares having regard to s. 2 of the Trade Marks Act, in that the trademark does not, and is not adapted to, distinguish the wares of the applicant from the wares and services of the opponent and Granny's Country-Oven Bakery Co. Ltd. in that Granny's Country-Oven Bakery Co. Ltd. and the opponent are related companies under s. 2 of the Trade Marks Act and Granny's Country-Oven Bakery Co. Ltd. and the opponent have previously in Canada made known and continue to make known the trademark 'Amigo' in association with tortillas, tortilla chips, taco shells, peppers, taco sauces, seasonings, frozen Mexican snacks and entrees and Granny's Country-Oven Bakery Co. Ltd. and the opponent have previously in Canada advertised and sold and continue to advertise and sell tortillas, tortilla chips, taco shells, peppers, taco sauces, seasonings, frozen Mexican snacks and entrees."
[5]
In rejecting the appellant's application the Chairman of the Trademarks Opposition Board found that the material date for determining the question of distinctiveness was August 21, 1985, the date upon which the statement of opposition had been filed. The Chairman found further that, as of that date, the extent to which the respondent had made the wholesale and retail food industry and the general public aware of the trademark "Amigo" was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden of the respondent to prove the allegations of fact asserted by it in its statement of opposition.
[6]
Finally the Chairman found that as the appellant failed to file any evidence relating to this issue he had likewise concluded that the appellant had failed to discharge the legal burden upon it of establishing that its proposed trademark "Amigos" was adapted to distinguish its wares from those of the respondent as of the date of the filing of the respondent's statement of opposition.
[7]
The appellant raises some twelve grounds of appeal but, as I appreciate the submissions of its counsel, the substance of its appeal is that in the circumstances of this case of material date for determining the issue of distinctiveness of the proposed mark should have been October 31, 1984, the date of the filing of the application. Alternatively the appellant submits that if the material date for determining the question of distinctiveness should be found to be August 21, 1985, the date of filing the statement of opposition, then the Chairman erred in accepting the evidence of use of the respondent's proposed trademark "Amigo" because it was either contrary to the spirit and policy of the Act, which the appellant claims is to afford protection to the first applicant of a proposed mark, or the use of the proposed mark, the evidence of which was accepted and relied upon by the Chairman, was illegal, unlawful or generated by the respondent in bad faith during a period after which it knew that its own proposed mark would not be allowed on account of the prior application of the appellant.
[8]
Put another way, the appellant submits that it is patently and obviously wrong that the respondent should be allowed to use evidence which it generated after the date of the appellant's application to defeat the appellant's application on the ground that the appellant's proposed trademark does not distinguish the wares of the appellant, in association with which the mark "Amigos" is proposed to be used, from the wares of the respondent in association with which the mark "Amigo" has been used in the interval between the date of the appellant's application being filed and the date of the filing of the respondent's statement of opposition.
[9]
The use of such evidence is particularly offensive to the appellant because all but a minuscule portion of it was generated by the respondent after May 10, the date on which the Trade Marks Office informed the respondent that it did not appear that its application could be allowed.
[10]
Counsel have referred me to a number of cases on the issue of the material date with respect to which the question of distinctiveness of trademarks should be determined:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Re Andres Wines Ltd. and E. & J. Gallo Winery, 25 C.P.R.(2d) 126;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Although there are one or two of them which appear to favour the date of filing the application as the material date for determining that issue, the majority favour the date on which the statement of opposition is filed as the material date.
[11]
I am in agreement with the Chairman's statement of law that the relevant date for determining the question of distinctiveness is the date of filing the opposition. In this respect I find support from Fox on The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3rd Ed., 1972), at page 24 where, in contrasting the position under the earlier legislation with the position under the legislation which, purposes of this action, is the same as the existing legislation, it is said:
"It is now only necessary that a mark offered for registration shall qualify as a trademark within the definition provided by s. 2(t); that it does not fall within any of the precluded classes established by ss. 9 to 12(1); that the person applying for its registration qualifies under s. 16; and that an application has been filed in accordance with s. 29. In such a case the Registrar is required under s. 36 to advertise the application for purposes of opposition. The Act gives no power to the Registrar to refuse an application at the threshold on the ground of any inherent quality of the trademark offered for registration. He may not refuse to register it on the ground that it is not distinctive. He may at that state refuse it only on any of the three grounds provided in s. 36. There is authority for the view that the Registrar is bound to register a trademark offered for registration unless he can find authority in the statute for excluding it [see footnote 49].
"If, however, registration of the trademark is opposed, one of the grounds of opposition provided by the statute [see footnote 50] is 'that the trademark is not distinctive'. The Registrar is then, but not otherwise, entitled to examine the question whether the mark is distinctive and, if he is satisfied that it is not, to reject the application [see footnote 51]."
[12]
At page 227 the author goes on to elaborate on the question of distinctiveness in the following terms:
"The claim to distinctiveness, and hence of registrability, of a proposed trademark must be based entirely upon its arbitrary character or in other words, upon the assertion that it is adapted to distinguish, if the application is opposed. As already discussed [see footnote 49] the Registrar is not entitled in the first instance to refuse an application on the ground that the trademark for which registration is sought is nondistinctive. That question only arises in cases of opposition under s. 37(2)(d), or, after registration, under s. 18(1)(b) if its validity comes into question. In the case of opposition to a proposed trademark no proof can be offered that it is distinctive as defined by s. 2(f) in the sense that is actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used because no use will have been made of it up to that time. Proof of distinctiveness can only be offered on the basis that it is a trademark that is adapted to distinguish the applicant's wares or services from those of others. For this reason these words have been added to the defining section [see footnote 50].
"Where a mark has not in fact been used it may be adapted to distinguish because it has characteristics calculated to make it noticeable and suitable for calling attention to the goods or services in association with which it is to be used and for identifying the origin of those goods or services. It is obvious, however, that where the mark sought to be registered has not been used, it is impossible to determine the question whether it is adapted to distinguish merely by an examination of the mark itself. It becomes necessary to ascertain the environment in which it is to be employed. For example, it may appear that the mark is one that is common to the trade, or it may appear that the environment is such that the mark, however great its inherent individuality, may suggest some idea not related to the idea of origin at all. In either of these cases its claim to be adapted to distinguish will fail [see footnote 51]."
[13]
In the present case there has been no suggestion by the respondent that the proposed trademark of the appellant, "Amigos", lacks inherent distinctiveness. Indeed in the respondent's submission to the Chairman its counsel acknowledged that both trademarks, "Amigo" and "Amigos", had considerable inherent distinctiveness in association with their respective wares. The respondent also acknowledged that neither trademark is descriptive or clearly descriptive but objects to the allowance of the appellant's application because there is no evidence that, prior to the opposition hearing, the appellant's proposed trademark "Amigos" had become known in Canada in association with the appellant while, to the contrary, there was considerable evidence that the respondent's trademark "Amigo" was known in Canada as of the date of the respondent filing its statement of opposition.
[14]
The respondent's submission is that the appellant's proposed trademark lacks distinctiveness in the sense that it does not serve to adequately distinguish wares of the appellant in association with which it is proposed to be used from the wares of the respondent in association with which the mark "Amigo" is proposed to be used. In my view that contention does not go to the issue of distinctiveness but to the issue of confusion. In other words both proposed trademarks "Amigos" and "Amigo" are distinctive, objectively and inherently, and within the environment in which they are proposed to be used. Neither, in my view, suggests some idea not related to the wares but both are admirably suited to be used in association with and to distinguish the products in association with which they are proposed to be used.
[15]
Although, in my view, both proposed marks are distinctive both cannot be allowed for registration, not because of any lack of distinctiveness, but because of the confusion which would be created by allowing both. In this respect the material date for determining the question of confusion, as opposed to distinctiveness, is governed by s. 16(3) of the Trade Marks Act which deals with applications for proposed trademarks in the following terms:
"(3) Any applicant who has filed an application in accordance with s. 30 for registration of a proposed trademark that is registrable is entitled, subject to ss. 38 and 40, to secure its registration in respect of the wares or services specified in the application, unless
at the date of filing of the application
it was confusing with
(a) a trademark that had been previously used in Canada or made known in Canada by any other person;
(b) a trademark in respect of which an application for registration had been previously filed in Canada by any other person; or
(c) a trademark that had been previously used in Canada by any other person." (Underlining added)
[16]
Where, in my view, the Chairman went wrong is not when he decided that the date for filing the statement of opposition was the date on which the issue of distinctiveness should be determined but when he accepted the respondent's allegations of fact contained in its statement of opposition as facts which, if proved, would be sufficient to support a claim that the appellant's proposed mark lacked distinctiveness.
[17]
As I see the statement of opposition, it alleges, in accordance with paragraph 38(2)(d), that the appellant's proposed mark is not distinctive but in support of that conclusion it alleges facts which support a conclusion that the appellant's application should not be allowed because the allowance of the appellant's proposed trademark application would cause confusion with the almost identical proposed trademark of the respondent. In that the respondent's allegations of fact raised the issue of confusion rather than distinctiveness, the material date for the determination of that issue is the date on which the appellant filed its application.
[18]
Because on that date there could not have been any confusion with other trademarks as contemplated by s. 16(3) of the Act the respondent's opposition should have been dismissed and the appellant's application allowed. Accordingly I will order that this appeal be allowed with costs.
[19]
On the basis that I may have erred in my conclusion I should say that I would also allow this appeal on the grounds that the Chairman should not have received the evidence of the respondent with respect to the use of its proposed trademark after the respondent had received the notice of May 10, 1985, from the Trade Marks Office that its proposed mark would not appear to be entitled to registration in view of the copending and conflicting application of the appellant.
[20]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  determination of conflicts between trademarks should be the date of the filing of the statement of opposition or the date of the opposition proceedings. The court found that the appropriate date should be the date of filing rather than the date of the proceedings, although the court did not rule out the possibility that the date should be the date of the filing of the application.
[21]
The reason given by the court for rejecting the later date and accepting the earlier one was as follows:
"The obvious fallacy in accepting the date of opposition proceedings as the effective date for the consideration of the rights between the parties rather than the date of the filing of the opposition would permit the circumstances being varied in the interval to strengthen the position of one of the parties. That happened in the Sico case and in the persent matter. In Sico the registered owner of the trademark extended the wares with which the mark was to be associated to inks generally amongst a host of others. That is a circumstance which ought not have been considered even though the ultimate result would have been the same.
"In the present matter the Registrar of Trademarks fell into the same error.
"Subsequent to the filing of the opposition the trademarks 'Freedom' and 'Liberte' were registered.
"The respondent then applied to amend its statement of opposition dated October 27, 1976, to include the allegations of confusion with the trademarks 'Freedom' and 'Liberte' as well. The amendment applied for was granted. Accepting the date of the filing of the opposition as the material date the application for the amendment to permit of the raising of events subsequent should not have been allowed and the possibility of confusion with registered trademarks should have excluded the subsequently registered trademarks."
[22]
In the present case the respondent had been informed of the unlikelihood of its application being allowed because of the apparent confusion with the appellant's application. It then set out to strengthen its case by the generation of evidence to show that it had a prior claim and stronger claim by reason of usage. In the words of the court in the Molnlycke case these are circumstances which should not have been considered and, in my view, for the same reason, the evidence of the respondent's activities which occurred after the notice of May 10, 1985, should not have been considered by the Chairman.
[23]
As the only evidence of use by the respondent prior to the notice of May 10, 1985, was that it displayed, but did not sell, its product packed in an "Amigo" wrapper at a trade show in early May of 1985, there was insufficient evidence of use of the respondent proposed mark upon which the Chairman could have come to the conclusion which it did.
[24]
As to the Chairman's observation with respect to the absence of any proof by the appellant with respect to the use of its proposed mark, it is apparent from s. 40 of the Act that no evidence of use between the time of filing the application and the allowance of the application is required.
Appeal allowed.
