Pinard, J. [TRANSLATION]
: The applicants are seeking to set aside a decision rendered on March 13, 1987 by an immigration officer, declaring them inadmissible to Canada under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1976. The applicants further asked to be dealt with in accordance with the Refugee Claims Backlog Regulations, regardless of the illness of the applicant Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska, and/or with prior access to any relevant and unfavourable information. The applicants indicated that these remedies are claimed in accordance with s. 18 of the Federal Court Act and/or s. 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[2]
On March 13, 1987 Katherine Joa, in the course of her duties as an immigration officer, met with Mrs. Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska, her husband Mr. Michel Stefanski and their daughter. At that time the immigration officer gave the applicant Michel Stefanski directly, in the presence of the other applicant and their daughter, the letter of rejection dated March 13, 1987, addressed jointly to Eliza, Alicja and Michel Stefanski, the English portion of which was completed and read as follows:
"Madam/Sir:
This concerns your claim to be recognized as a Refugee, under the terms of the Geneva Refugee Convention.
Although, potentially, you could be admitted to the Administrative Review Project, announced by the Minister of State for Immigration on May 21, 1986, you are an inadmissible person to Canada, described in paragraph (or subsection) 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act, because you are a person who suffer [sic] from a disability which might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services.
Therefore, you cannot be admitted to Canada under the terms of the Administrative Review Project mentioned above.
As you have indicated that you wish to be considered a Convention Refugee, your claim will be allowed to continue and will be processed on a priority basis."
[3]
At this interview at the Galt Immigration Centre, the immigration officer first explained to the applicants that an error had been made in the preliminary evaluation of their situation and that this error consisted of their being summoned for an interview to be evaluated under s. 5 of the Refugee Claims Backlog Regulations, whereas they should have been told at once that they were in an admissible class for medical reasons connected with the applicant Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska. The immigration officer further explained to them that Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska's illness made the other members of the family inadmissible and that the favourable evaluation of their situation by the immigration services in the province of Quebec would not suffice to grant them landing.
[4]
The immigration officer did not recall whether the applicants had access at that time to the medical notification (form No. MS-1014) which was in the record; however, she stated that if they had asked questions regarding the disease which she was unable to answer using only the medical notification, she would at once have referred them to the examining physician or to the medical services of the Minister of Health and Welfare, in accordance with the instructions given to immigration officers in this regard. In fact the applicants showed no surprise and did not ask any questions.
[5]
The applicant Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska had earlier been seen by Dr. Dubois-Roy, of the Clinique Santé-Accueil in Montréal, in his capacity as examining physician for the Medical Services Branch of Health and Welfare Canada, in the course of preparing the required medical notification for immigration purposes. Dr. Dubois-Roy then referred the applicant to Dr. Gordon Francis, a neurologist, for a further examination and report. Finally, Drs. Robert W. Beaulieu and Claude T. Gendron, both physicians with the Department of Health and Welfare, on April 3, 1986 signed the medical notification (form No. MS-1014) regarding the applicant Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska.
[6]
Dr. Beaulieu explained that before issuing a notice stating that admission of the applicant would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services, he had first consulted a copy of the complete medical record on the applicant provided by Dr. Dubois-Roy. This medical record contained the following documents:
(1) a detailed report by the neurologist Gordon Francis and his analysis of tests taken by the applicant at the radiology department of the Hôpital St-Luc in Montréal;
(2) a report dated July 10, 1985 from the Warsaw institute of psychoneurology on the applicant, who was born in that city in Poland;
(3) the detailed report of Dr. Dubois-Roy and the various reports of tests he requested at the Quebec Laboratoire de santé publique, the Hôpital St-Luc and the radiologists Vallée et Associés in Montréal.
[7]
After consulting this entire medical record Dr. Robert W. Beaulieu signed medical notification MS-1014, in which Dr. Claude T. Gendron, M.D., by his signature also confirmed and concurred in his medical opinion. The medical notification in question mentions at the appropriate point that the admission of Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services. The notification further states, under the heading "Comments" (translation):
"DIAGNOSIS:
1. CEREBRAL ORGANIC DISEASE BY RETARDATION WITH UNCONTROLLABLE EPILEPSY AND RIGHT HEMIPARESIS
-
2. EUTHYROIDIAN MULTINODULAR GOITER.
"COMMENT:
1. State of health requires excessive health or social services and will not respond to treatment.
-
- Inadmissible under s. 19(1)(a)(ii)."
[8]
The medical profile contained in notification MS-1014 also contains a series of letters and coded figures the meaning of which was explained by Dr. Beaulieu as follows (translation):
"H2: Constitutes possible danger to public safety due to sudden incapacity.
"D6: Needs or may need special care at home indefinitely, medical supervision and/or social assistance payments.
"T5: No effective treatment exists or is known.
"S1: No supervision necessary.
"E5: Unemployable or nonproductive.
"M7: Inadmissible (health or social services). Suffers from disease that would cause excessive demands on health or social services and treatment not likely to be effective. Person inadmissible under 19(1)(a)(ii)."
[9]
Dr. Beaulieu further stated that the medical services he belongs to sent an immigration officer only the diagnosis made of the person concerned; he explained that only the original and one copy of medical notification MS-1014 were sent to the immigration officer in order to observe the confidentiality of information obtained and findings made by the examining physicians regarding the person concerned, and also because of the limits imposed by the authorization signed by that person on the back of form MS-1017, as to the release of information obtained in medical examinations taken for immigration purposes.
[10]
However, Dr. Beaulieu indicated that, like any person taking medical examinations for immigration purposes, the applicant was entitled to have the medical record prepared on her on request and this record could also be given to her physician on receipt of an authorization signed by her. He mentioned that there was nothing in the applicant's record to indicate that she or her physician had ever asked to be allowed to see the medical record in question.
[11]
The relevant provisions of the Refugee Status Backlog Regulations, the Immigration Act, 1976 and the Regulations made thereunder are as follows:
(A) Refugee Claims Backlog Regulations
"3. A member of the refugee claims backlog may make an application for landing pursuant to these Regulations to an immigration officer.
"4. For the purpose of an application for landing made pursuant to s. 3, a member of the refugee claims backlog is exempt from the provisions of s. 9(1) of the Act and ss. 4 to 11 and s. 14(1) of the Immigration Regulations, 1978.
"6(1) Where a member of the refugee claims backlog makes an application for landing, an immigration office may grant landing to the member and his dependants if he and the dependants
(a) meet the requirements of the provisions of the Act and these Regulations and the provisions of the Immigration Regulations, 1978 from which they have not been exempted under s. 4 of these Regulations; and
(b) in the opinion of the immigration officer, based on the factors described in s. 5, are or are likely to become successfully established in Canada."
(B) Immigration Act, 1976
"19(1) No person shall be granted admission if he is a member of any of the following classes:
(a) persons who are suffering from any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer,
(i) they are or are likely to be a danger to public health or to public safety, or
(ii) their admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services
"2(1) In this Act,
'medical officer' means a qualified medical practitioner authorized or recognized by order of the Minister of National Health and Welfare as a medical officer for the purposes of this Act ..."
(C) Immigration Regulations
"22. For the purpose of determining whether any person is or is likely to be a danger to public health or to public safety or whether the admission of any person would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services, the following factors shall be considered by a medical officer in relation to the nature, severity or probable duration of any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment from which the person is suffering, namely,
(a) any reports made by a medical practitioner with respect to the person;
(b) the degree to which the disease, disorder, disability or other impairment may be communicated to other persons;
(c) whether medical surveillance is required for reasons of public health;
(d) whether sudden incapacity or unpredictable or unusual behaviour may create a danger to public safety;
(e) whether the supply of health or social services that the person may require in Canada is limited to such an extent that
(i) the use of such services by the person might reasonably be expected to prevent or delay provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent residents, or
(ii) the use of such services may not be available or accessible to the person;
(f) whether medical care or hospitalization is required;
(g) whether potential employability or productivity is affected; and
(h) whether prompt and effective medical treatment can be provided."
[12]
There is no doubt that the decision challenged by the applicant is a purely administrative one. There is also no doubt that a decision of this type remains fully subject to judicial review, and its validity in law will depend on factors of a jurisdictional and procedural nature.
[13]
In jurisdictional terms, the question is whether the decision was made by a duly constituted authority acting without abuse of power, that is in good faith, with objectivity, for reasons and in a way which may have been defined by the Act. In the case at bar, I consider that these conditions have been met. The immigration officer was undoubtedly the duly constituted authority to make the decision pursuant to s. 6 of the Refugee Claims Backlog Regulations. As that officer had before her a medical notification meeting the requirements of s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Act, after Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska, who claimed landing in Canada, had been duly referred to the examining physician for a medical examination for immigration purposes, she no longer had any discretion and had no alternative but to find the applicants, husband and wife, inadmissible.
[14]
As to whether the diagnosis stated in the medical notification in question is accurate and fully supports the opinion of the physicians who signed it, these are questions of fact and not of law (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). If the applicants had been able to show that entries or notations in the medical notification were so inconsistent with each other that they made the document as a whole incoherent, then of course such a medical notification could not constitute the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). However, that is not the case here. The medical notification is clear and its content quite coherent as regards the medical record consulted by Dr. Robert W. Beaulieu and the explanations given by him.
[15]
In jurisdictional terms, therefore, the decision was manifestly made by the proper authority who acted in good faith in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
[16]
In procedural terms, since the decision affects individual rights and interests, the administrative authority must have acted fairly (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 671). In the case at bar this duty simply required that before making a decision the authorities should ensure that Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska was seen by an examining physician and took the medical examination prescribed for immigration purposes; subsequently, a medical notification consistent with the requirements of s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Act compelled the immigration officer to regard the applicants as inadmissible. In view of the legislation within which the immigration officer was required to act, I cannot accept the proposition that the officer should have disclosed the relevant medical information to the applicants before making her decision. Once again it sufficed that the applicant, who was aware of her condition, was seen by the examining physician and that a medical notification in accordance with s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the Act was duly made.
[17]
Additionally, if the applicants had established that the medical officers failed to comply with the requirements of s. 22 of the Regulations, as for example by failing to consider any report made regarding Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska by a physician (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the duty to act fairly had not been fulfilled; however, nothing of this kind was established in the case at bar, and moreover Alicja Tunikowska Stefanska was aware of her condition and did not directly or indirectly ask for access to any medical information whatever concerning it.
[18]
In procedural terms, therefore, I consider that the administrative authority acted fairly and that there is no basis for applicants' action. There can be no question of inquiring any further into the validity of the diagnosis and the medical opinion contained in notification MS-1014, without giving a substantive content to the duty to act fairly which I must ensure is carried out. However, it is well established that as a general rule, in a case of judicial review, a superior court should not step into the shoes of the administrative authority in this way when what is required is simply a decision as to the facts and credibility.
[19]
As to the involvement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, counsel for the applicants only cited s. 15 alternatively in an effort to have the decision in question set aside. Though recognizing the validity of the applicable legislation and regulations, both those associating the fate of dependants with that of the person claiming the right to landing and those linking a person's admissibility to his state of health, counsel for the applicants argued strictly that the said legislation was discriminatory in the particular case of the applicants.
[20]
In this context, I do not think that the applicants were treated any differently from other persons in a situation similar to their own, nor do I consider in any case that they were treated unfairly or unreasonably. I adopt and apply to the case at bar the observations of Pratte, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 238 F.C.:
"There are, in my opinion, two main reasons why the applicant cannot successfully invoke s. 15. In order for that section to apply, there must be an inequality; there must also be discrimination. There is an inequality within the meaning of s. 15 when persons who are similarly situated are treated differently; there is discrimination when that difference of treatment is neither fair nor reasonable. In my view, both these elements are absent in this case."
[21]
Additionally, the applicants also were unable to prove an unjustified invasion of the rights and freedoms guaranteed to them by the Charter, including those of s. 7.
[22]
For all these reasons, after considering all the affidavits in the record, the transcript of the cross-examinations of Dr. Robert W. Beaulieu and Mrs. B. Katrine Joa, all the documents in the record, and after hearing counsel for the parties and considering the particular circumstances of the case at bar, I must dismiss the application with costs.
Application dismissed.
