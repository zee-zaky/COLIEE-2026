Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.
[1]
Pinard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the "Act") of a decision by a visa officer (the "officer") at the Embassy of Canada in Beijing, China. In the decision, the officer refused the applicant's application for a work permit in Canada.
[2]
The applicant is a 26-year-old citizen of China.
[3]
From September 2003 to July 2006 the applicant studied culinary art at the high school level. From July 2007 to present he has worked as a "Third Wok Chef" in Cantonese cuisine in Guangzhou, China.
[4]
The applicant's father, mother and only sibling, a sister, all live in Guangzhou.
[5]
On October 24, 2011 the applicant submitted a work permit application at the Embassy of Canada in Beijing. The applicant stated he had a job offer from a Canadian Chinese restaurant located in Enderby, British Columbia.
[6]
The applicant submitted a declaration along with his application in which he explained why he would not remain in Canada after his authorized stay. He also stated he is the heir to a four-storey building owned by his father presently worth approximately 3 million RMB. The applicant submitted a declaration from his father to this effect.
* * * * * * * *
[7]
The officer communicated her decision in a standard form letter dated January 5, 2012. The officer stated she was not satisfied that the applicant would leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay because of the applicant's travel history, current employment situation, personal assets and financial status.
[8]
The officer stated four reasons for her decision in the Global Case Management System ("GCMS") notes. First, the officer found that because the applicant has a medium occupational level in his field and a high school level of education, it would likely be easy to re-staff the applicant's current position in China. Second, the officer found that the documents submitted by the applicant showed "modest savings" and two "modest-size properties" under his father's name and did not demonstrate the applicant was sufficiently established in China. Third, the officer was not satisfied that the applicant had a strong incentive to depart Canada at the end of his authorized stay because the officer researched job postings for cooks in Guangdong, the Chinese province in which the applicant resides, and found that the applicant's prospective employment in Canada offered a higher income than what was being offered to cooks in Guangdong. Finally, the officer found that the applicant's lack of any travel outside of China, along with his strong family ties to Canada and modest income did not add weight to his establishment in China.
[9]
The officer noted that she did not consider interviewing the applicant because there were no concerns beyond the evidence submitted that should be put to the applicant.
[10]
The issues raised by the present application for judicial review are the following:
1. Did the officer err in finding that the applicant's current position in China would be easy to re-staff?
2. Did the officer err in her analysis of the applicant's financial establishment and the incentive to work in Canada?
3. Did the officer err in her analysis of the applicant's travel history?
4. Did the officer breach the duty of procedural fairness?
5. Did the officer give proper weight to the applicant's declaration?
[11]
The decision to issue or refuse a temporary resident visa involves a determination of mixed fact and law and it is to be reviewed on the reasonableness standard. Such decisions are generally afforded deference by this Court (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 196 at para 21;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 42 at paras 15-16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ).
[12]
However, the issue of whether the officer had the obligation to interview the applicant is an issue of procedural fairness that should be assessed on the correctness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 4).
* * * * * * * *
1.
Did the officer err in finding that the applicant's current position in China would be easy to re-staff?
[13]
In my opinion, the officer analyzed the facility with which the applicant's position will be replaced in China for the purpose of determining whether the applicant had demonstrated he was well established in China. The officer subsequently considered various factors, including the applicant's demonstrated establishment in China, to analyze the fundamental issue of whether the applicant would stay in Canada illegally after his authorized stay. Therefore, the officer did not have to explain how the Chinese employer's ability to re-staff the position related to whether the applicant would leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay.
[14]
I agree with the respondent that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is similar to the present case. The officer in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> also considered whether the applicant could be easily replaced in his job as a cook in China. This consideration was one of many factors that supported the officer's finding that the applicant had not demonstrated he was well established in China. This Court did not find the officer's analysis on this point to be unreasonable. Similarly, I am of the view that the officer in the present case did not err in finding that the applicant's position in China would be easy to re-staff.
2.
Did the officer err in her analysis of the applicant's financial establishment and the incentive to work in Canada?
[15]
Although a financial incentive, on its own, cannot justify the refusal of a work permit, it may be considered along with other evidence regarding the applicant's establishment in China (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 9).
[16]
I agree with the respondent that the officer did not err in her analysis of the applicant's economic situation. The officer did not base her analysis solely on the financial incentive for the applicant to work in Canada. She also considered the evidence of the applicant's financial establishment in China and evidence concerning his career ties to China in determining whether he was established in China. Therefore, in my opinion, the officer did not commit a reviewable error in this regard.
3.
Did the officer err in her analysis of the applicant's travel history?
[17]
The officer in the present case considered whether the applicant's international travel history could support a finding of establishment in China. The officer did not draw an adverse inference from the travel history and thus committed no reviewable error (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 11).
4.
Did the officer breach the duty of procedural fairness?
[18]
First, this Court's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the sole authority cited by the applicant on this issue, does not convince me that it was incumbent on the officer to give the applicant an opportunity to contest the officer's findings that the applicant's savings were modest and that the applicant's father's properties were of modest-size. In contrast to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the officer in the present case did not doubt that the applicant was genuinely interested in working as a cook in Canada.
[19]
Second, the authority cited by the applicant does not convince me that the officer's finding of a financial incentive to remain in Canada illegally was a generalization to which the applicant was entitled to respond.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relied upon by the applicant, is distinct in my view because the generalization made in that case was a broad stereotype, while the officer's opinion in the present case, that there is a financial incentive for the applicant to remain in Canada, is based on evidence of the salary differential.
[20]
Regarding the third procedural fairness issue raised by the applicant, the case law teaches that generally, where an officer has extrinsic information of which the applicant is unaware, the applicant should be given the opportunity to disabuse the officer of any concerns arising from that evidence ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 7;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to 25). In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this Court found that the applicant was not entitled to an interview because the officer relied only on materials submitted by, or known to, the applicant.
[21]
In the present case, the officer relied on job postings for cooks in the applicant's province and compared this information with the salary offered by the applicant's prospective employer in Canada. I believe the applicant would have likely been aware of the range of salaries for cooks in his province. Therefore, no reviewable error was made by the officer by failing to give the applicant the opportunity to respond to this evidence.
[22]
Regarding the fourth procedural fairness issue raised by the applicant, the authority relied upon by the applicant does not convince me that, because the officer did not believe the applicant would leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay, the applicant was entitled to an interview. The authority cited by the applicant does not demonstrate that these circumstances give rise to an entitlement to an interview.
5.
Did the officer give proper weight to the applicant's declaration?
[23]
Finally, the applicant argues that the officer ignored the declaration he filed with his work permit application.
[24]
The applicant relies on Justice Martineau's decisions in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above. He argues that the officer in the present case had a duty to view the statements in the declaration the applicant filed in support of his work permit application in light of the totality of the evidence and the applicant's personal circumstances.
[25]
The applicant submits in his oral pleadings that such declarations are a means for the applicant to convey considerations to the officer which can not be communicated in the work permit application form. Relying on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicant submits that this Court has found such declarations are not"banal."
[26]
The respondent admits in oral pleadings that the officer's decision does not refer to statements the applicant made in his declaration. However, the respondent argues that based on this Court's guidance in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the officer did not have a duty to do so. The respondent submits that the officer's statement in her affidavit that she considered all of the evidence put forth by the applicant is consistent with the burden imposed on officers in the case law.
[27]
I agree with the applicant that the officer's decision in this case does not comply with Justice Martineau's guidance in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
Huang.
[28]
The applicant in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was also a Chinese citizen who was offered employment as a cook in a Chinese restaurant in Canada. Like the declaration before the officer in the present case, the applicant in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> had submitted a declaration along with his work permit application that directly addressed the question of illegally overstaying a temporary work permit. As part of his decision to allow the application for judicial review in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Martineau stated the following regarding how an officer must weigh such a declaration:
[13] The decision to submit the applicant's declaration is not a banal gesture. The declaration is a clear statement that the applicant understands the consequences of overstaying his welcome in Canada, and for this reason, it will not happen. It cannot be presumed to be true, as the policy considerations of such a blanket approach would be disastrous: every applicant would simply submit a similar declaration in order to "prove" that he would not overstay his temporary permit. However, the statements made in this declaration
must
be weighed by the officer in light of the totality of the evidence and the personal circumstances of the applicant. [Emphasis added.]
[29]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Justice Martineau repeated this guidance and concluded that the officer in that case had committed no reviewable error in the manner the officer dealt with the declaration:
[13] The Court has recognized that declarations of this sort, though not banal, cannot be presumed to be true and
must
be viewed in light of the totality of the evidence and the personal circumstances of the applicant; viewing them otherwise would amount to a policy where a declaration would be all that was required to prove that an applicant would not overstay his permit ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13). In the CAIPS notes, the Visa Officer acknowledged the applicant's statements, and determined that "these declarations however are not disinterested and could not be forced upon him". This is not an unreasonable inference in the Court's opinion. [Emphasis added.]
[30]
More generally, a court will be reluctant to defer to an administrative decision-maker's decision where the reasons consider in detail the evidence supporting the decision but do not refer to important evidence pointing to a different conclusion:
[17] However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact "without regard to the evidence":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion,
it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact
. [Emphasis added.]
(stated by Justice Evans in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Cepeda-Gutierrez
], and reiterated by the Federal Court of Appeal in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
[31]
In his declaration, the applicant stated that he would obey Canadian law and regulations and leave the country before his work permit expires. He stated that his prospective employer in Canada will pay for his return ticket to China only if the applicant leaves Canada before the expiry of his work permit. He declared that he understood that overstaying his work permit could result in limiting his opportunities to travel internationally in the future, as well as limiting the opportunities of his family members, and as a result he would never stay in Canada illegally. The applicant stated he was very close with his mother, father and sister in China, as well as his girlfriend, and he did not want to be separated from his family or his girlfriend on a long term basis.
[32]
In contrast to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the officer's GCMS notes in the case at bar made no acknowledgement of the statements in the applicant's declaration. For instance, the officer did not acknowledge the applicant's close personal ties in China and the other reasons for why the applicant would return to China before his work permit expires.
[33]
I note that the officer stated in her affidavit that she considered all the evidence put forth by the applicant and that she stated in her cover letter for the decision that she had carefully reviewed all the documentation in the application. The officer did not make any such statement in the GCMS notes. I am of the opinion that a blanket statement of having considered all the evidence does not suffice to meet the burden on the officer as established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> in dealing with a declaration in a work permit application. In her decision the officer did not directly weigh the statements in the declarations against the other evidence, for example by acknowledging the statements in a manner like the officer did in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 13.
[34]
Moreover, the officer in the present case considered in detail the evidence supporting her decision, namely the employer's ability to re-staff the applicant's position in China, the applicant's financial establishment in China and the applicant's incentive to work in Canada. Yet the officer failed to refer specifically to the applicant's declaration, which was important and direct evidence pointing to the conclusion that the applicant would leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay. In these circumstances, based on this Court's guidance  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Gutierrez
at paragraph 17, it is more easily open to this Court to infer that the officer committed a reviewable error by failing to directly refer to the statements in the declaration.
[35]
Therefore, in my view the officer committed a reviewable error by failing to weigh the applicant's declarations in light of the totality of the evidence and the personal circumstances of the applicant.
* * * * * * * *
[36]
For the above-mentioned reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred back to a different visa officer for reconsideration.
[37]
I agree with counsel for the parties that this is not a matter for certification.
JUDGMENT
[38]
The applicant's application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27, is allowed. The decision by a visa officer at the Embassy of Canada in Beijing, China, is set aside and the matter is sent back for redetermination by a different visa officer.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire, présentée en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), visant la décision par laquelle une agente des visas (l'agente) de l'Ambassade du Canada à Beijing, en Chine, a rejeté la demande de permis de travail au Canada faite par le demandeur.
[2]
Le demandeur est un citoyen de la Chine âgé de 26 ans.
[3]
De septembre 2003 à juillet 2006, le demandeur a fait des études secondaires en art culinaire. Depuis juillet 2007, il travaille comme [traduction] « troisième chef wok » en cuisine cantonaise à Guangzhou, en Chine.
[4]
Le père, la mère et la seule sœur du demandeur vivent à Guangzhou.
[5]
Le 24 octobre 2011, le demandeur a présenté une demande de permis de travail à l'Ambassade du Canada à Beijing. Il a déclaré qu'un restaurant chinois canadien, à Enderby (Colombie-Britannique), lui avait fait une offre d'emploi.
[6]
Le demandeur a accompagné sa demande d'une déclaration dans laquelle il expliquait qu'il ne resterait pas au Canada une fois terminée sa période de séjour autorisée. Il affirmait également être l'héritier d'un immeuble de quatre étages appartenant à son père, d'une valeur actuelle d'environ 3 000 000 de yuans. Le demandeur a produit pour en attester une déclaration formulée par son père.
* * * * * * * *
[7]
L'agente a communiqué sa décision au moyen d'une lettre type datée du 5 janvier 2012. Elle y disait ne pas être convaincue que le demandeur quitterait le Canada à la fin de son séjour autorisé en raison de ses antécédents de voyage, de sa situation professionnelle et financière ainsi que de ses avoirs personnels.
[8]
L'agente a fait état dans ses notes consignées dans le Système mondial de gestion des cas (le SMGC) de quatre motifs fondant sa décision. L'agente a premièrement conclu qu'étant donné que le demandeur était d'un niveau professionnel moyen dans son domaine et avait atteint un niveau d'études secondaires, il serait vraisemblablement facile de pourvoir à son poste actuel en Chine. Selon les documents produits par le demandeur, a deuxièmement conclu l'agente, celui-ci disposait de [traduction] « maigres économies », il n'était pas suffisamment établi en Chine et son père avait en son nom deux [traduction] « immeubles de taille modeste ». Troisièmement, l'agente a estimé que le demandeur ne serait pas fortement incité à quitter le Canada au terme de son séjour autorisé, parce qu'elle avait effectué une recherche visant les offres d'emploi pour cuisiniers dans le Guangdong, la province de résidence du demandeur en Chine, qui lui avait permis de constater qu'un salaire plus élevé était offert au demandeur pour son emploi éventuel au Canada que pour les emplois de cuisinier offerts dans le Guangdong. L'agente a quatrièmement conclu, enfin, que l'absence de tout voyage fait hors de Chine par le demandeur, les liens importants qu'il avait avec des membres de sa famille au Canada et son revenu modeste ne renforçaient guère son degré d'établissement en Chine.
[9]
L'agente a mentionné qu'elle n'avait pas envisagé d'interroger le demandeur parce que, hormis ce que la preuve produite permettait de constater, il n'y avait pas de sujet d'inquiétude particulier à lui communiquer.
[10]
Les questions qui suivent sont soulevées dans le cadre de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire.
1. L'agente a-t-elle conclu erronément qu'il serait facile de doter le poste actuellement occupé par le demandeur en Chine?
2. L'agente a-t-elle analysé erronément l'établissement au plan financier du demandeur et l'incitatif à travailler au Canada?
3. L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse des antécédents de voyage du demandeur?
4. L'agente a-t-elle enfreint l'obligation d'équité procédurale?
5. L'agente a-t-elle accordé un poids suffisant à la déclaration du demandeur?
[11]
Décider de délivrer ou de ne pas délivrer un visa de résident temporaire nécessite de statuer sur des questions mixtes de fait et de droit et appelle ainsi la norme de contrôle de la raisonnabilité. La Cour fait habituellement preuve de retenue à l'égard de telles décisions (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 196, au paragraphe 21;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 42, aux paragraphes 15 et 16;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] ).
[12]
Toutefois, la question de savoir si l'agente avait l'obligation d'interroger le demandeur est une question d'équité procédurale qui, elle, doit être examinée selon la norme de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 4).
* * * * * * * *
1.
L'agente a-t-elle conclu erronément qu'il serait facile de doter le poste actuellement occupé par le demandeur en Chine?
[13]
À mon avis, c'est pour juger si le demandeur avait démontré qu'il était bien établi en Chine que l'agente a analysé la facilité avec laquelle son poste serait doté dans ce pays. L'agente a ensuite examiné divers facteurs, notamment la preuve de l'établissement en Chine du demandeur, pour pouvoir trancher la question fondamentale, celle de savoir si le demandeur allait demeurer illégalement au Canada une fois terminée sa période de séjour autorisée. Ainsi, l'agente n'avait pas à expliquer en quoi la capacité de l'employeur en Chine de pourvoir au poste était liée à la possibilité que le demandeur quitte ou non le Canada au terme de son séjour autorisé.
[14]
Je conviens avec le défendeur que l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ressemble à la nôtre. Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'agent a aussi examiné la facilité avec laquelle on pourrait remplacer le demandeur à son poste de cuisinier en Chine. Ce facteur était l'un parmi de nombreux autres permettant à l'agent de conclure que le demandeur n'avait pas prouvé qu'il était bien établi en Chine. La Cour n'a pas jugé déraisonnable l'analyse de l'agent sur ce point. De même manière, j'estime que l'agente n'a pas commis d'erreur en l'espèce en concluant qu'il serait aisé de pourvoir au poste du demandeur en Chine.
2.
L'agente a-t-elle analysé erronément l'établissement au plan financier du demandeur et l'incitatif à travailler au Canada?
[15]
Bien qu'un incitatif financier ne puisse justifier, en soi, le refus de délivrance d'un permis de travail, il peut être pris en compte avec d'autres éléments de preuve relatifs à l'établissement du demandeur en Chine ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 9).
[16]
Comme le défendeur, j'estime que l'agente n'a pas analysé erronément la situation économique du demandeur. L'agente n'a pas uniquement fondé son analyse sur l'incitatif pour le demandeur à travailler au Canada. Elle a également examiné la preuve concernant l'établissement financier du demandeur en Chine et ses liens professionnels avec la Chine afin de pouvoir juger s'il était bien établi dans ce pays. L'agente n'a donc pas commis à cet égard, selon moi, une erreur susceptible de contrôle.
3.
L'agente a-t-elle commis une erreur dans son analyse des antécédents de voyage du demandeur?
[17]
L'agente a examiné en l'espèce si les voyages internationaux antérieurs du demandeur pouvaient étayer une conclusion d'établissement en Chine. L'agente n'a pas tiré une conclusion défavorable des antécédents de voyage du demandeur, et elle n'a donc pas commis non plus sur ce point une erreur susceptible de contrôle ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 11).
4.
L'agente a-t-elle enfreint l'obligation d'équité procédurale?
[18]
Premièrement, la décision de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la seule citée par le demandeur sur ce point, ne me convainc pas que l'agente devait fournir à celui-ci l'occasion contester ses conclusions selon lesquelles il ne disposait que de maigres économies et les immeubles de son père étaient de taille modeste. Contrairement à la situation dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'agente n'a pas douté en l'espèce que le demandeur avait véritablement l'intention de travailler comme cuisinier au Canada.
[19]
Deuxièmement, la décision invoquée par le demandeur ne me convainc pas que la conclusion de l'agente portant qu'il y avait pour lui un incitatif financier à demeurer illégalement au Canada constituait une généralisation à laquelle il avait le droit de réagir. On peut en effet établir une distinction entre l'affaire citée,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  et la présente affaire puisque que la généralisation en cause dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> était un stéréotype sommaire, tandis que l'opinion exprimée par l'agente en l'espèce, soit qu'il existait pour le demandeur un incitatif financier à demeurer au Canada, reposait sur une preuve relative à une différence de salaire.
[20]
Quant au troisième point soulevé par le demandeur en matière d'équité procédurale, la jurisprudence nous enseigne que, règle générale, si un agent s'appuie sur des éléments de preuve extrinsèques dont le demandeur n'est pas au courant, il devrait donner l'occasion à ce dernier de dissiper ses doutes découlant de cette preuve (
Huang,
au paragraphe 7;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 25). Dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour a conclu que le demandeur n'avait pas droit à une entrevue parce que l'agent s'était fondé uniquement sur les documents présentés ou connus par ce dernier.
[21]
En l'espèce, l'agente s'est fondée sur des offres d'emploi pour les cuisiniers dans la province du demandeur, pour ensuite comparer l'information tirée avec le salaire offert par l'employeur éventuel au Canada. Il est vraisemblable, selon moi, que le demandeur connaissait la fourchette des salaires versés aux cuisiniers dans sa province. L'agente n'a donc pas commis d'erreur susceptible de contrôle en n'accordant pas au demandeur l'occasion de réagir à la preuve en cause.
[22]
Quant au quatrième point soulevé en matière d'équité procédurale, la jurisprudence invoquée par le demandeur ne me convainc pas que, parce que l'agente ne croyait pas que le demandeur quitterait le Canada au terme de son séjour autorisé, celui-ci disposait du droit d'être interrogé. Il ne ressort pas de la décision citée par le demandeur que l'existence de telles circonstances donne ouverture au droit à une entrevue.
5.
L'agente a-t-elle accordé un poids suffisant à la déclaration du demandeur?
[23]
Enfin, le demandeur soutient que l'agente a fait abstraction de la déclaration qu'il a jointe à sa demande de permis de travail.
[24]
Faisant valoir les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, du juge Martineau, le demandeur prétend qu'en l'espèce, l'agente était tenue d'examiner les affirmations formulées dans la déclaration produite au soutien de sa demande de permis de travail au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve et de sa situation personnelle.
[25]
Le demandeur soutient dans sa plaidoirie qu'une telle déclaration permet à un demandeur de faire part à l'agent de considérations qu'il ne peut communiquer au moyen du formulaire de demande de permis de travail. Le demandeur se fonde sur les décisions <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> pour faire valoir que, selon la Cour, de telles déclarations ne sont pas« banales ».
[26]
Le défendeur admet dans sa plaidoirie que l'agente n'a pas mentionné dans sa décision les affirmations formulées par le demandeur dans sa déclaration. Il soutient toutefois, sur le fondement des lignes directrices de la Cour dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , que l'agente n'y était aucunement tenue. Selon le défendeur, en déclarant dans son affidavit qu'elle avait examiné l'ensemble de la preuve soumise par le demandeur, l'agente s'est acquittée du fardeau imposé aux agents par la jurisprudence.
[27]
Je conviens avec le demandeur que la décision de l'agente en l'espèce n'est pas conforme aux lignes directrices énoncées par le juge Martineau dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et
Huang.
[28]
Dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le demandeur était un citoyen de la Chine à qui on avait offert un poste de cuisinier dans un restaurant chinois au Canada. Le demandeur avait joint à sa demande de permis de travail une déclaration, semblable à celle soumise à l'agente dans la présente affaire, qui portait directement sur la question de la prorogation indue d'un permis de travail. Tout en accueillant la demande de contrôle judiciaire dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , le juge Martineau a fait les commentaires suivants quant à la façon dont un agent devait examiner une telle déclaration:
[13] La décision de soumettre la déclaration du demandeur n'est pas un geste banal. La déclaration est une affirmation claire que le demandeur comprend les conséquences d'un prolongement indu de séjour au Canada, et pour cette raison, il n'aura pas lieu. Cette déclaration ne peut être présumée vraie, car les considérations de principe d'une telle approche générale seraient désastreuses: un demandeur n'aurait qu'à soumettre une déclaration semblable afin de « prouver » qu'il ne prorogera pas indûment son permis de travail temporaire. Cependant, les affirmations formulées dans cette déclaration
doivent
être examinées par l'agent au regard de l'ensemble de la preuve et de la situation personnelle du demandeur. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[29]
Le juge Martineau a répété ces lignes directrices dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , en concluant cette fois cependant que l'agent n'avait pas commis d'erreur susceptible de contrôle dans son traitement de la déclaration du demandeur:
[13] La Cour a reconnu que des déclarations de ce genre, bien qu'elles ne soient pas banales, ne peuvent être présumées véridiques et
doivent
être considérées à la lumière de la totalité de la preuve et de la situation personnelle du demandeur; les considérer autrement équivaudrait à une politique selon laquelle une déclaration suffirait pour prouver qu'un demandeur ne prolonge pas indûment la durée de son permis ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 13). Dans les notes du STIDI, l'agent des visas a reconnu les déclarations du demandeur et a déterminé que [traduction] « ces déclarations ne sont cependant pas désintéressées et leur application ne pourrait lui être imposée ». La Cour estime qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une conclusion déraisonnable. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[30]
De manière plus générale, une cour sera peu encline à la retenue face à la décision d'un décideur administratif lorsque, dans ses motifs, celui-ci examine de façon détaillée les éléments de preuve qui étayent sa décision, mais passe sous silence d'importants éléments qui pourraient mener à une conclusion différente:
[17] Toutefois, plus la preuve qui n'a pas été mentionnée expressément ni analysée dans les motifs de l'organisme est importante, et plus une cour de justice sera disposée à inférer de ce silence que l'organisme a tiré une conclusion de fait erronée "sans tenir compte des éléments dont il [disposait] ":
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.). Autrement dit, l'obligation de fournir une explication augmente en fonction de la pertinence de la preuve en question au regard des faits contestés. Ainsi, une déclaration générale affirmant que l'organisme a examiné l'ensemble de la preuve ne suffit pas lorsque les éléments de preuve dont elle n'a pas discuté dans ses motifs semblent carrément contredire sa conclusion. Qui plus est, quand l'organisme fait référence de façon assez détaillée à des éléments de preuve appuyant sa conclusion, mais qu'elle passe sous silence des éléments de preuve qui tendent à prouver le contraire,
il peut être plus facile d'inférer que l'organisme n'a pas examiné la preuve contradictoire pour en arriver à sa conclusion de fait.

(lignes directrices énoncées par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )
[31]
Le demandeur a affirmé dans sa déclaration qu'il respecterait les lois et règlements du Canada et qu'il quitterait le pays avant l'expiration de son permis de travail. Il a aussi mentionné le fait que son employeur éventuel au Canada n'allait payer son billet de retour vers la Chine que s'il quittait le Canada avant cette expiration. Le demandeur a dit comprendre que, s'il prorogeait indûment son permis de travail, cela pourrait rendre plus difficile à l'avenir, pour lui et les autres membres de sa famille, de voyager à l'étranger, et qu'en conséquence, jamais il n'allait demeurer au Canada illégalement. Le demandeur a finalement affirmé qu'il était très proche de sa mère, de son père, de sa sœur ainsi que de sa petite amie en Chine, et qu'il ne voulait pas être séparé d'eux à long terme.
[32]
En l'espèce, contrairement à l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , l'agente n'a pas pris acte dans ses notes consignées au SMGC des affirmations formulées dans la déclaration du demandeur. L'agente n'a pas fait état, par exemple, des liens étroits du demandeur avec diverses personnes en Chine, non plus que des autres motifs pouvant l'inciter à retourner dans ce pays avant l'expiration de son permis de travail.
[33]
Je constate que l'agente a mentionné, dans son affidavit, avoir examiné l'ensemble de la preuve présentée par le demandeur et, dans la lettre d'accompagnement de la décision, avoir passé en revue avec soin tous les documents joints à la demande de permis. Elle n'a fait aucune mention en ce sens dans ses notes consignées au SMGC. J'estime que le fait de soutenir de manière générale que l'ensemble de la preuve a été examiné, lorsqu'une déclaration est jointe à une demande de permis de travail, ne permet pas de satisfaire au fardeau imposé aux agents par <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Dans sa décision, l'agente n'a pas évalué directement les affirmations dans les déclarations par rapport aux autres éléments de preuve, par exemple en reconnaissant les affirmations comme l'avait fait l'agent dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (au paragraphe 13).
[34]
En l'espèce, en outre, l'agente a examiné en détail les éléments de preuve qui étayaient sa décision, soit la capacité de l'employeur de doter le poste du demandeur en Chine, l'établissement au plan financier du demandeur dans ce pays et l'incitatif pour le demandeur de travailler au Canada. Malgré cela, l'agente n'a pas mentionné la déclaration du demandeur expressément, même s'il s'agissait d'un élément de preuve direct et important pouvant amener à conclure que le demandeur quitterait le Canada au terme de son séjour autorisé. Il est plus aisé pour la Cour de conclure en de telles circonstances, compte tenu des lignes directrices de la Cour dans
Cepeda-Gutierrez
, au paragraphe 17, que l'agente a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en ne mentionnant pas expressément les affirmations formulées par le demandeur dans sa déclaration.
[35]
J'estime, par conséquent, que l'agente a commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle en n'examinant pas la déclaration du demandeur au regard de sa situation personnelle et de l'ensemble de la preuve.

Pour les motifs exposés, la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent des visas pour nouvel examen.
[37]
J'estime comme les avocats des parties qu'aucune question n'a à être certifiée.
JUGEMENT
[38]
La demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par le demandeur en application du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27, est accueillie. La décision rendue par un agent des visas de l'Ambassade du Canada à Beijing, en Chine, est annulée et l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent des visas pour qu'il statue à nouveau sur celle-ci.
