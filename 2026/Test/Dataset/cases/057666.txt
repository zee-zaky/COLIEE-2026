McGillis, J.
: The applicant was a candidate in a closed competition for the position of head gardener in the Department of National Defence at CFB Esquimault in Victoria, British Columbia. The Selection Board, which consisted of two individuals, assessed the five candidates on their performance in a written examination. One of the members of the Selection Board assessed the candidates for personal suitability, a qualification in the Statement of Qualifications which was to be rated on sub-factors of alertness, reliability and co-operativeness. All of the candidates received identical marks on each of the sub-factors of personal suitability. The applicant ranked second in the competition behind the successful candidate. The eligibility list issued by the Public Service Commission contained only the name of the top candidate from the competition.
[2]
The applicant appealed under s. 21 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33, to the Public Service Commission Appeal Board ("the Appeal Board") against the selection for appointment. At the hearing before the Appeal Board, the applicant argued, among other things, that the manner in which the Selection Board assessed the personal suitability of the candidates breached the merit principle.
[3]
At the hearing before the Appeal Board, the member of the Selection Board who rated the personal suitability of the candidates testified that he assessed the candidates on the basis of his knowledge of them and comments made to him by several foremen who had worked with them. In discussing with these foremen the matter of the personal suitability of the candidates, the member of the Selection Board did not ask any specific questions. However, he asked some of the foremen the same questions concerning some of the candidates. Although the member of the Selection Board testified that he recorded in writing some of the comments made by the foremen, he was unable to produce any such documentation or information. In response to questions from the Chairman of the Appeal Board concerning the identical ratings of the candidates on personal suitability, the member explained that he could "... find no difference that made any difference on -- appreciable difference on the thing". He further testified that "the answers I got from the people led me to believe that that was where I should place them".
[4]
In his reasons for decision, the Chairman of the Appeal Board found that there was prima facie evidence that the personal suitability of the candidates had been assessed. Although he found it "surprising" that the candidates received identical ratings on all of the sub-factors and "unfortunate" that the analysis was not described in the documentation prepared by the Selection Board, he concluded as follows:
"However, I cannot set aside the Selection Board's findings without any information to show that the marks awarded did not fairly reflect the level of the candidates' personal qualities. No information has been brought forward to show why the personal qualities of the appellant should have been rated any differently than the personal qualities of the selected candidate. While the assessments made by the Selection Board may seem unusual, there is no reason for me to conclude that they are inaccurate."
[5]
In my opinion, the Appeal Board erred in law in misconstruing the duty of the Selection Board to rate the candidates on all of the qualifications required for the position in a manner which would permit "... an assessment of the candidates' relative merit". ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  there was an absence of any cogent evidence, either oral or documentary, in the record to establish the manner in which the merit of the candidates was assessed by the Selection Board on the qualification of personal suitability. In the absence of an appropriate evidentiary framework, the Appeal Board could not have properly determined that the merit principle was respected in the assessment of the candidates on personal suitability. Furthermore, the Appeal Board purported to place on the applicant the obligation to adduce evidence to establish that her personal qualities "... should have been rated any differently than the personal qualities of the selected candidate". In doing so, the Appeal Board improperly relieved the Selection Board of its onus of establishing that the assessment of the candidates was conducted in accordance with the merit principle.
[6]
In view of my conclusion, it is unnecessary for me to consider the other arguments which were raised by counsel.

The application for judicial review is allowed. The decision of the Appeal Board dated April 21, 1994 is quashed and the matter is remitted to the Appeal Board with the direction that the appeal of the applicant be allowed.
Application allowed.
