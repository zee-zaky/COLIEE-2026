Joyal, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks dismissing an opposition filed by the appellant to the application by the respondent for the registration of the trademark "Piattelli and Design".
The Facts:
[2]
The issue between the parties goes back a dozen years or more and for purposes of providing some clarity, chronological recital of the facts might be warranted.
[3]
It was on November 20, 1975, that the respondent filed an application for the registration of the word mark "Piattelli" in association with men's shirts and ladies' blouses. The respondent claimed first use of the mark as of April 1975.
[4]
On March 3, 1978, the application was approved for registration and was given Certificate of Registration No. 226,1978.
[5]
On August 31, 1981, under No. 474,799, the appellant Bruno Piattelli, described as a well-known Italian clothes and accessories designer, applied for registration of "Bruno Piattelli" with respect to substantially the same wares as the respondent's. The appellant claimed priority on the basis of a concurrent application for registration in Italy dated January 28, 1981. No further action, however, appears to have been taken and the Canadian application was later abandoned.
[6]
On December 21, 1981, the respondent applied for registration of the mark "Piattelli and Design" covering the same wares, i.e., men's shirts and ladies' blouses.
[7]
The mark was described as being a signature in a stylized creation and not an actual signature. The form and guise of the mark and design are as follows:
[8]
The respondent claimed first use at least as early as April 1981. Its application was given No. 479,966. An amended application for the same word mark and design was filed by the applicant on October 19, 1984, and again indicated first use as of April 1981.
[9]
Some correspondence was exchanged between the respondent and the Trademarks Office respecting the stylized design and whether a disclaimer on the mark itself was warranted. On the basis of the appellant's prior registration in 1978 of the mark "Piattelli" and on assurances that the signature was a stylized one, these problems appear to have been overcome and on February 20, 1985, the application was advertised in the
Trade Marks Journal
. It was at this time that the appellant filed his opposition to the registration.
[10]
In the meantime, however, under date of May 24, 1984, the appellant had applied again for the registration of "Bruno Piattelli" as intended use in Canada in association with "service of fashion design, namely: styling, clothing and accessories to other manufacturers". The appellant again claimed priority under s. 33 of the
Trade Marks Act
on the basis of the prior use in Italy where by this time, his trademark had reached the registration stage. The Canadian application was given No. 522,620. It would appear that it has remained in limbo or in abeyance since that time.
The Opposition:
[11]
The grounds raised by the appellant in his statement of opposition were as follows:
1. The application did not comply with s. 29 of the
Trade Marks Act
in that the date of first use was, according to an investigation, inaccurate.
2. Pursuant to s. 37(2)(b) and s. 9 of the
Act
, the proposed mark was not registrable as it as the signature of "Bruno Piattelli", contrary to the applicant's statement that the signature was a stylized one.
3. The mark, pursuant to s. 37(2)(d) was not distinctive as it was the family name and signature of the opponent.
The Counter-Statement:
[12]
The respondent, in its pleading dated September 5, 1985, denied the foregoing allegations and stated:
1. that the mark was registrable under s. 37(2)(b);
2. that it was distinctive;
3. that it met the requirements of s. 29(b) of the
Act
;
4. that the mark was not primarily merely the surname of an individual nor was it the signature of the appellant;
5. that the appellant was already the owner of the trademark "Piattelli", registered back in 1978 under No. 226,324.
The Evidence:
[13]
Evidence in support of the appellant's opposition was filed on August 5, 1986, in an affidavit of Jackie-Anne Collette, setting out by way of exhibits the concurrent application for the registration of the mark "Bruno Piattelli" the registration of the same mark in Italy and concluding that "Piattelli" was the appellant's family name.
[14]
The respondent countered with reply affidavits of Michael Gold dated October 6, 1986, and of John Haluke dated October 21, 1986. The affidavits referred to advertising and sales of shirts bearing the mark "Piattelli" and design since 1981 and 1983 respectively.
[15]
A further affidavit dated October 27, 1986, executed by the appellant was filed on November 26, 1986. On April 7, 1987, both Michael Gold and John Haluke were cross-examined on their affidavits and the transcripts thereof filed in the record.
[16]
Further written arguments were filed with the Opposition Board and finally, the hearing on the opposition was held on November 17, 1989.
[17]
On January 31, 1990, the Chairman of the Opposition Board rendered his decision dismissing the appellant's opposition.
The Opposition Board Decision:
[18]
In this decision, the Opposition Board traversed the following grounds of opposition and disposed of them as follows:
1. On the grounds that the respondent's date of first use of the trademark was inaccurate, and in noncompliance with s. 30(b) of the
Act
, the Opposition Board simply had to note that the respondent's evidence on this issue was clear and that the disclosure by the respondent and his predecessor in title as to date of first use was supported by the witnesses Michael Gold and John Haluke.
2. On the grounds that the use of the trademark by a purchaser of the assets of the predecessor in title of the mark had been prior to the purchaser's registration as a registered user with respect to the 1978 trademark "Piattelli", No. 226,324, the Opposition Board rejected it on the grounds that this issue had not been pleaded by the appellant.
3. On the grounds that the mark was not registrable because it was the signature of the appellant Bruno Piattelli and contrary to s. 9(1)(d), the Opposition Board was of the view that there was no sufficient resemblance between the two as to likely mistake one for the other. That ground was accordingly rejected.
4. Finally, on the grounds that the respondent's mark was not distinctive as it was the family name and signature of the appellant, the Opposition Board stated that even if this were true, there was no evidence adduced by the appellant that his surname had acquired a reputation in Canada whatsoever in association with clothing or otherwise. The Opposition Board concluded that the alleged lack of distinctiveness had not been established and that ground of opposition was also rejected.
Appellant's Appeal:
[19]
On April 2, 1990, the appellant filed his notice of appeal before this court. Three grounds of appeal were alleged:
1. That there was error in deciding that the appellant's mark neither constituted nor resembled the appellant's signature and in deciding that the appellant's mark was distinctive;
2. that no proper evaluation of the evidence was made;
3. that there was error in not taking into consideration the use of the mark by the predecessor's purchaser of the mark while not enjoying registered user status and thereby rendering the mark nondistinctive.
The Findings:
[20]
I have no problem in dealing with appellant's arguments on the issues raised in his notice of appeal. In my view, the Opposition Board, on the basis of the evidence before it and on the strength of the grounds of opposition advanced by the appellant, was amply justified to rule as it did.
[21]
On his appeal before this court, however, the appellant raised an issue which had not been raised before the Opposition Board or in the pleadings in this court, namely that the trademark was unregistrable by virtue of s. 12(1)(a) of the
Trade Marks Act
which denies registration to "a word that is primarily merely the name or surname of an individual who is living or has died within the preceding thirty years". Counsel argued that as the appellant bore the name and surname "Bruno Piattelli", it was evident that the impugned trademark was primarily merely the surname of an individual and the mark subject to expungement.
[22]
The respondent's counsel took strong objection to this line of argument and argued that it should not be considered by the court at this stage of the proceedings. I took his objection under reserve and permitted the appellant to argue on it.
[23]
I should now rule that that line of attack on the registration should be considered. It raises a point of law where, irrespective of the parties' approach to the issue, whether by way of evidence, pleadings or argument, a court,
proprio motu
, is judicially bound to consider it.
[24]
My consideration of the issue, however, provides no relief for the appellant. We are dealing here with a mark which was originally registered in 1978 on the basis of first use in April 1975. Whether or not in considering that application, the Registrar's mind was directed to the possibility that at that time, the word Piattelli was
primarily merely
the name or surname of an individual, is today of no concern to this court.
[25]
Firstly, regard must be had for s. 12(2) of the
Act
which tempers considerably the statutory prohibition found in s. 12(1)(a). Section 12(2) states:
"12(2) A trademark that is not registrable by reason of paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1) is registrable if it has been so used in Canada by the applicant or his predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of filing an application for its registration."
[26]
Secondly, s. 18(2) of the
Act
appears to create some kind of estoppel to a claim of invalidity. This section reads as follows:
"18(2) No registration of a trademark that has been so used in Canada by the registrant or his predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of registration shall be held invalid merely on the ground that evidence of the distinctiveness was not submitted to the competent authority or tribunal before the grant of registration."
[27]
In my respectful view, this provision is to give some degree of finality to registered trademarks. Assuming therefore that the word "Piattelli" was at all relevant times
primarily merely
an individual's surname, it matters not one whit that evidence of the kind of distinctiveness reflected in s. 12(2) of the
Act
might not have been submitted to the Registrar.
[28]
Finally, I should note that the appellant's argument based alone on s. 12(1)(a) of the
Act
is far from persuasive, let alone conclusive. The prohibition contained in the provision is qualified by the terms "primarily merely ... the surname of an individual". Especially when dealing with a word which is neither English nor French, courts have tended to give some meaning to that expression. I have in mind the decision of Cattanach, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and a more recent decision of Teitelbaum, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In both cases, the word marks were the names of individuals but the court found that they were not primarily merely the names of individuals.
[29]
It is reasonable to conclude therefore that if in 1977 the Registrar did not have reason to find that "Piattelli" was primarily merely an individual's surname, that he considered the subsequent application for "Piattelli and Design" on the basis of that prior registration, and the Registrar's record is clear on this, any debate on the issue, whether pursuant to s. 12(2) with respect to distinctiveness, or to s. 18(2) with respect to invalidity, is now preempted.
[30]
The appellant's appeal is accordingly dismissed, with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
