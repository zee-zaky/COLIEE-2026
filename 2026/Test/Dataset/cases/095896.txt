Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: This is an applica­tion for an order prohibiting the Registrar of Trademarks from proceeding with the appli­cations for registration of the trade-marks identified and published in the
Trade Marks Journal
of April 24, 1996 (Vol. 43 - No. 2165), p. 56 under Serial No. 783,742 and Serial No. 783,743, both filed by the respon­dent Eli Lilly Company ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
Facts
[2]
The case deals with the capsules contain­ing fluoxetine hydrochloride or PROZAC. The trademarks in issue are the (1) "colours pale green and whitish-yellow applied to the whole visible surface of the capsules", and (2) the "colours pale green and pale grey applied to the whole visible surface of the capsules."
[3]
In November 1995 Lilly brought an action for passing off, pursuant to s. 7 of the
Trademarks Act
[see footnote 1] (the "
Act
"), against Novopharm, Apotex and Nu-Pharm. Lilly sought injunctions to prohibit the defendants' use of capsules the same size, shape and colour as the plaintiffs', based on the following arguments:
(i) the colour, shape and size of the 10 and 20 mg fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules formed Lilly's trade dress, and were dis­tinctive to Lilly;
(ii) the activities of the defendants would direct attention to their capsules in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause con­fusion in Canada between the defendant's capsules and those of Lilly; and
(iii) Lilly had filed applications to register the trade dress of their 10 and 20 mg fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules, earlier that year, having Serial Nos. 783,742 and 783,743 on May 25, 1996.
[4]
In a decision dated 25 April 1997, Reed, J., dismissed the actions. [see footnote 2] She found:
(i) There had been no use by Lilly in Canada [see footnote 3]
. . . . .
(ii) The capsules are not distinctive of Lilly in Canada [see footnote 4]
. . . . .
(iii) The plaintiffs did not prove that the defendants' sale of fluoxetine in capsules having a similar appearance to those of the plaintiff would result in any significant likelihood of confusion. [see footnote 5]
[5]
Lilly has appealed the decision of Reed, J., in the passing off actions to the Federal Court of Appeal. The appeals are still pend­ing. [see footnote 6]
[6]
On 26 May 1995, Lilly filed an applica­tion with the Registrar of Trademarks for the two trademarks in issue.
[7]
The Trademarks office approved the trade­mark applications and advertised them in the
Trade Marks Journal
for opposition pur­poses on 26 April 1996.
[8]
On 24 September 1996, Novopharm filed statements of opposition against each of the applications, based in summary on the fol­lowing grounds:
a) the alleged trademarks were not used in Canada by Lilly since the date claimed;
b) the colours of the alleged trademarks do not of themselves distinguish Lilly's wares;
c) the alleged trademarks are not trade­marks being functional; and
d) Lilly's alleged trademarks consisting of the colours of its capsules are not distinc­tive in that the colours do not distinguish its wares from those of others.
[9]
Novopharm and Apotex brought an interim motion to stay the opposition pro­ceedings. The motion was dismissed in its entirety by Rothstein, J., on 30 June 1997. [see footnote 7] He was not satisfied that Novopharm would suffer irreparable harm if the motion was not granted, whereas it appeared that Lilly would be prejudiced by an interim stay, by reason of delay before the Trademarks Opposition Board.
Issues
Does The Federal Court Have Jurisdiction
To Grant Prohibition Against The
Registrar Of Trademarks, When She
Is Acting With­in Her Jurisdiction?
Does The Decision Of Reed, J., Render
The Matter Before The Registrar
Of Trade­marks Res Judicata?
Positions Of The Parties
[10]
In summary, the applicants submit that the decision of Reed, J., was rendered, based on extensive evidence submitted by both parties, on precisely the same issues. The matter before the Opposition Board is there­fore res judicata. To permit the Registrar to continue the opposition proceedings, when a full trial has already been conducted on the issues, would be to permit Lilly to launch a collat­eral attack on the decision rendered, by bringing proceedings in another forum. To do so would constitute an abuse of process, and as such would be a ground for granting a prohibition, under s. 18.1(4)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
:
"18.1(4) The Trial Division may grant relief under subsection (3) if it is satisfied that the federal board, commission or other tribunal
. . . . .
(b) failed to observe a principle of natu­ral justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that it was required by law to observe;"
"18.1(4) Les mesures prévues au paragraphe (3) sont prises par la Section de première instance si elle est convaincue que l'office fédéral, selon le cas:
. . . . .
b) n'a pas observé un principe de justice naturelle ou d'équité procédurale ou toute autre procédure qu'il était légalement tenu de respecter;"
[11]
With respect to the decision of Reed, J., being under appeal, and thus not a "final" decision, the applicants submitted that the writ of prohibition is a discretionary power, which the court can tailor to suit the specific facts of this case. They suggested, for example, an "interim" order, which would be lifted if Reed, J.'s, judgment is overturned on appeal.
[12]
The respondents, on the other hand, submit that this court does not have jurisdiction to prevent a federal board, acting within its jurisdiction, from carrying out its duty. The writ of prohibition is restricted to where there has been a jurisdictional error or a violation of natural justice or procedural fairness. There is no evidence before the court that the Registrar of Trademarks has committed any reviewable error or violated any rule of natural justice or procedural fairness.
[13]
Further, the respondents submit that it is not appropriate for this court to determine the issue of res judicata in these proceedings. There are essential requirements for this principle to apply: a decision must be final; there has to be identity of issues; and there must be identity of parties. Two of these essential elements are not present in this case. Therefore, the doctrine cannot apply.
[14]
Finally, there is an important distinction to be drawn between a stay and a prohibition, which is in fact what Novopharm and Apotex are seeking. If seeking a stay, they have failed to prove irreparable harm. If seeking a prohibition, they must show the Registrar is acting outside of her jurisdiction.
Analysis
Does The Federal Court Have Jurisdiction
To Grant Prohibition Against The
Registrar Of Trademarks, When
She Is Acting Within Her Jurisdiction?
[15]
A writ of prohibition lies essentially to prevent an enforcer tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction. In the context of a trade mark opposition proceeding, a writ of prohibition will be available where there has been a jurisdictional error or a violation of natural justice or procedural fairness.
[16]
As stated by Jerome, A.C.J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relief,
my concerns are limited to whether the registrar properly exercised his jurisdiction and whether there has been a denial of natural justice or fairness
. As long as these conditions have been fulfilled, the registrar may be entitled to be wrong in law until he has been appealed." [see footnote 9] (My emphasis)
[17]
It is admitted by the applicants that the issue of distinctiveness relied upon in the present application will be raised in the opposition proceedings and that it falls within the jurisdiction of the Registrar of Trademarks to consider. There is no authority for this court to prohibit the Registrar from carrying out duties imposed on her by the statute.
[18]
The applicants have submitted the cases of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  law, an applicant is entitled to apply for prohibition rather than waiting to see if the case goes against it.
[19]
The case of
Bell Canada
dealt with an individual who complained to the Ontario Human Rights Commission (the "Commission") that he had been denied housing based on discriminatory grounds. The Commission's jurisdiction was limited by the
Ontario Human Rights Code, 1961-62
. [see footnote 12] Therefore, when a majority of the Supreme Court determined that the matter fell outside of that statute, they held that an order of prohibition could be granted.
[20]
In the present case, however, the determination of registrability falls directly within the Registrar's jurisdiction. As a result,
Bell Canada
does not apply.
[21]
The case of
Cara Operations
, does not support the applicants' contention, either. In fact, this case strongly supports the respondents' case.
[22]
The applicant in
Cara Operations
, brought an application for an order of prohibition to prohibit the Registrar of Trademarks, in opposition proceedings before him, from receiving and considering as evidence documents filed in previous opposition proceedings between the same parties.
[23]
Walsh, J., held that the only possible prejudice to the applicant would be the necessity of rearguing the same material.
"Moreover even if the task to the applicant of having to eventually re-argue at length before the registrar at an oral hearing in which applicant will oppose the introduction of this evidence, issues which the applicant successfully argued before the Court of Appeal in the expungement proceedings, it appears to me that it is premature to depart from the detailed procedures set out in the
Trade Marks Regulations
leading to an eventual hearing of the opposition. To require the registrar to do so would establish a precedent which might not be limited, as applicant contends, to the unusual circumstances of this particular case where the Court of Appeal has already decided that this evidence was inadmissible in expungement proceedings, but might have far reaching consequences. There can be no prejudice to the applicant, other than possible delay and the necessity of further argument on the issue if the matter is left for eventual decision in the first instance by the registrar after full argument before him, since if he decides that portions of this evidence can be considered in arriving at his decision on the opposition, this decision can always be appealed by applicant." [see footnote 13]
[24]
Later in the same judgment, Walsh, J., states that the court should not intervene where the statute provides an appeal.
"Moreover the court should not exercise its discretion to grant the prohibitory relief claimed since there is an appeal provided for under s. 56 of the
Trade Marks Act
. ... [T]his court should not exercise its discretion so as to grant a writ of prohibition against the registrar and prevent him from considering this issue at the proper time in accordance with the provisions of the
Trade Marks Act
and
Trade Marks Regulations
." [see footnote 14]
[25]
The approach taken by Walsh, J., is reflective of this court's treatment of applications for orders of prohibition against the Registrar or Commissioner of Patents in trademark and patent cases. The case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  issue:
"I have no difficulty whatsoever in concluding that this portion of the statement of claim must be struck out ... the
Trade Marks Act
provides the way in which applications for trademarks may be opposed ... [it] contains a complete code of procedure in such circumstances which has to be followed. I know of no authority which would allow the court to abridge or by-pass these statutory provisions. This, in effect, is what the plaintiff is asking the court to do ..."
[26]
In my opinion, the applicants are attempting a similar approach. This court does not have jurisdiction to prohibit the Registrar from performing the task she is statutorily obligated to perform, where there is no evidence that she is acting outside of her jurisdiciton. To find otherwise, would be to permit the applicants to by-pass these statutory provisions.
Does The Decision Of Reed, J.,
Render The Matter Before The
Registrar Of Trademarks Res Judicata?
[27]
The applicants submit that it would be an abuse of process to continue the matter, as the issues have been decided before Reed, J.; and, therefore, the matter is res judicata.
[28]
There are three main components to the principle of res judicata:
a) a final judicial decision pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction,
b) identity of the action or issue, and
c) identity of the parties. [see footnote 17]
[29]
A decision must be final before res judicata can apply. If an appeal is pending, the decision is not final. [see footnote 18]
[30]
In the present action, the decision of Reed, J., is pending before the Federal Court of Appeal. This alone is sufficient to deny the application for prohibition.
[31]
In fact, the applicants concede that the decision is not final, but submit that this can be remedied by ordering "interim" relief until the appeal is decided. If the appeal is granted, the prohibition would be lifted.
[32]
I do not believe it is appropriate to modify the pre-conditions of the principle of res judicata, in order to "fit" the relief sought by the applicants. The decision is not final pending the determination of the appeal. Therefore, there is no res judicata; and, there is no abuse of process in the proceedings before the Registrar.
[33]
The nature of the relief sought by the applicants is in fact a stay of proceedings, pending the disposition of the appeal. A writ of prohibition is not a stay - different conditions apply. In the present case, a stay could not be granted because of the lack of evidence of irreparable harm, which is an essential component of a stay application. [see footnote 19]
[34]
Further, there is some doubt as to the applicability of the doctrine of res judicata in opposition proceedings.
[35]
In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  does not apply in opposition proceedings." In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reasoning.
"It is well established that the concept of res judicata does not apply in opposition proceedings (references omitted). The Registrar is free to decide each case on its own merits. If the Registrar is not to be bound by prior opposition board decisions or Federal Court Appeals, then it follows that passing off decisions of other courts should also not be binding. In other actions, the issues are bound to differ at least slightly, the evidence presented will be different from that presented in the opposition process, and the material dates may be different." [see footnote 21]
Although this principle has been cited in several opposition decisions, it has not yet been specifically addressed by this court.
[36]
The reasoning of these decisions was based on that of Gibson, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  before the Registrar, because of the involvement of the public interest. Section 44 (now s. 45) of the
Trademarks Act
deals with expungement proceedings.
[37]
The underlying rationale of these decisions is that the Registrar is responsible for ensuring the purity of the record and that this task should not be tainted by the factually specific arguments of parties to an opposition proceeding. As Gibson, J., stated:
"Moreover, the doctrine of res judicata or the application of any principle not technically so denominated but having an effect equivalent to res judicata cannot apply to proceedings under s. 44 of the
Trade Marks Act
. This is so because there is a public interest in proceedings under s. 44 of the
Trade Marks Act
to maintain and preserve the purity of the register, which public interest transcends the rival claims between parties as to their respective interests, namely, the interest of the registrant and the interest of any other person in the registration." [see footnote 23]
[38]
It is important to note, however, that the procedure surrounding s. 44 (now s. 45) is very different from an opposition proceeding. As indicated by Gibson, J., an expungement proceeding is not an ordinary proceeding between two parties.
"A proceeding, however, under s. 44 of the
Trade Marks Act
is not an ordinary proceeding inter partes. For example, in such a proceeding before the Registrar of Trademarks, affidavit or statutory declaration evidence of the registrant only may be filed and considered by the Registrar. No cross-examination may be had on any such affidavit or statutory declaration by any third party or by the Registrar. For these reasons, res judicata or any principle having an equivalent result does not apply." [see footnote 24]
[39]
Contrast this with an opposition proceeding where both parties may submit affidavit evidence and make representations, [see footnote 25] seek an opportunity to cross-examine the other party's evidence, [see footnote 26] and eventually request an oral hearing. [see footnote 27] In my opinion, res judicata should not bind a party which has not had the opportunity to participate in the proceedings. However, where both parties have been given equal opportunity to present their case and to challenge their opponent's case, then those parties should be bound by the decision rendered. The decision of the Registrar may then be appealed to the Federal Court.
[40]
Although this point is not necessary to decide the matter before me, I am of the opinion that res judicata should apply to opposition boards, but only where the pre-conditions are satisfied. However, on a practical level, I note that the number of technical differences in this area of the law will render the principle of little relevance.
[41]
Finally, the applicants have submitted the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  action, it is estopped from applying for registration.
[42]
In that case, Maclean, J., held that where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had rejected the passing-off claim, it would be an abuse of process to allow the losing party to then bring an application for registration:
"In view of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the infringement action taken by the petitioner, the objecting party here having been one of the defendants therein, I feel impelled to the conclusion that the issues raised in the petition are res judicata. ... It would seem to me that to allow the petition to proceed further would be an abuse of the machinery of the courts, and would further offend against the rule that there must be a finality in litigation. ... I think that the judgment of the Judicial Committee is conclusive of the matter." [see footnote 29]
[43]
In the present action, as I said earlier, the decision of Reed, J., has been appealed to the Court of Appeal, and thus, is not a "final decision", as required by the doctrine of res judicata. Therefore, this case can be distinguished from
Canadian Shredded Wheat
, supra, since Reed, J.'s, judgment is not "conclusive of the matter."
[44]
For these reasons, the application for prohibition is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
