Cullen, J.
: Counsel for the appellant/applicant quotes the late Laskin, C.J., as saying that ss. 18 and 28 of the Federal Court Act "have bedevilled the courts". The wording of these two sections often leaves counsel wondering which procedure to follow and how to secure relief in a particular situation. Consider the background to the action taken by the appellant/applicant here.
BACKGROUND
[2]
The appellant/applicant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada and has its principal office and place of business in Calgary, Alberta. The respondent, Canada Packers Ltd., is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada and has its principal office and place of business in Toronto, Ontario.
[3]
The Registrar of Trademarks is appointed by the Governor in Council.
[4]
The appellant/applicant filed an application for the registration of the Trademark CATTLE-PAK for use in association with meat products namely, processed, unprocessed, cooked, and uncooked meats on September 5, 1985, and this was accorded application no. 548,348 by the Registrar of Trademarks.
[5]
On the 27th of January 1986, the examiner, for the Registrar of Trademarks, formally approved application no. 548,348 for advertisement in the Trade Marks Journal and so advised the appellant/applicant.
[6]
Application no. 548,348 appeared in the Trade Marks Journal dated April 9, 1986.
[7]
The period for filing an opposition to application no. 548,348 expired on May 9, 1986, at which time no statement of opposition had been filed nor had there been an application for an extension in time to file a statement of opposition.
[8]
Thus, in the ordinary course of events, the appellant/applicant expected on May 10, 1986, that the Registrar of Trademarks would have allowed application 548,348, but for reasons unknown he did not do so.
[9]
Section 38 of the Trade Marks Act reads as follows:
"38.(1) When an application either has not been opposed and the time for the filing of a statement of opposition has expired or it has been opposed and the opposition has been decided finally in favour of the applicant, the Registrar thereupon shall allow it.
"(2) The Registrar shall not extend the time for filing a statement of opposition with respect to any application that has been allowed."
The section looks quite explicit and the Registrar would seem to have had no option. However, I commend for the attention of counsel an unreported case  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the time for filing a statement of opposition where an application has been allowed. Unhappily for the appellant/applicant, the application had not been allowed and so the Registrar, under the authority of ss. 46(1) and (2), allowed an extension of time to file a statement of opposition.
[10]
In any event, after an exchange of correspondence with counsel for the respondent, and as indicated earlier, the Registrar of Trademarks granted the respondent Canada Packers Inc., until August 1, 1986, to file a statement of opposition, which the respondent had done on July 30, 1986.
[11]
On September 12, 1986, the Registrar forwarded the statement of opposition to the agent for the appellant/applicant. On October 31, 1986, the appellant/applicant filed "Notice of Appeal and Originating Notice of Motion". The appellant/applicant "appeals against the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks ... granting the respondent Canada Packers Inc. an extension to August 1, 1986, pursuant to s. 46(2) of the Trade Marks Act to file a Statement of Opposition".
[12]
The appellant/applicant makes an application pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal Court Act for an Order:
(1) That the Registrar of Trademarks be prohibited from taking any further proceedings under s. 37 of the Trade Marks Act, and for an Order that such proceedings as have taken place, be quashed, and
(2) That a writ of mandamus issue directing the Registrar of Trademarks to formally allow registration of the application no. 548,348.
[13]
Counsel for the appellant/applicant, when attending to file this document, was advised by the Registrar at the Federal Court that "these were two different matters" and "the Notice of Appeal should not come under s. 18 whereas the Originating Notice of Motion should be mentioned with a
returnable date
". Counsel told the court that the Registrar's superior authorized the document to be filed. At first blush it seemed to be like the old baseball axiom, "If you can't get him at first, get him at second".
[14]
The Registrar was correct, and from a procedural standpoint the process is seriously flawed. From a substantive point of view, the respondent Canada Packers Inc. does not know on which section the appeal relies because no mention is made of any authority or section. Second, the proposed motion has no date of return nor does it meet the requirements of s. 18 of the Federal Court Act, having reference to rules 603 and 319 of the Act. (Another alternative is by way of action under rule 400 and that is clearly not the case here.) Although procedural errors can be corrected, they are too serious here to enable the respondent to reply in any informed manner. The respondent has the right to know the basis for the motion, i.e., the supporting affidavit, the right to cross-examine on the affidavit and has the option of replying or not, and if it decides a reply is in order then it too must file an affidavit and be subject to cross-examination.
[15]
For these reasons alone, the respondent's proposed originating notice of motion is "an abuse of the process of the court" and an Order will go striking the Originating Notice of Motion.
NOTICE OF APPEAL
[16]
In my view the decision of the Registrar of Trademarks is clearly not a final decision and is therefore not appealable under s. 56 of the Trade Marks Act.
[17]
Under the Trade Marks Act and Rules, the Registrar makes several decisions before making his final determination on the opposition pursuant to s. 37(a) of the Act. In some instances, preliminary decisions made by the Registrar may be final, for example if he rejects the statement of opposition as frivolous under s. 37(4) of the Trade Marks Act. Alternatively, if the Registrar accepts the statement of opposition as raising substantive grounds, this cannot be considered a final decision because it does not finally determine the rights between the parties.
[18]
The distinction between final and interlocutory decisions of the Registrar of Trademarks is important because of the Federal Court of Appeal's holding that only final decisions are appealable under s. 56 of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the decision dealt with proceedings under s. 44 of the Trade Marks Act. Cattanach, J., of this court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , had occasion to consider the matter in relation to the grant of an extension of time to oppose a trademark application. In his preliminary consideration of the matter, his Lordship, in referring to the Anheuser-Busch decision, stated at p. 119:
"The reasoning so adopted from its premise to conclusion is equally susceptible of precluding the appeal from a decision of the registrar to extend the time under s. 46 of the Act to file a statement of opposition under s. 37 in opposition proceedings. If the time had not been extended it is possible that the decision not to do so might be construed as final because the opposition proceedings would be effectively ended but not appealable although there is the right to move for expungement of the trademark if subsequently requested, in accordance with the decision in the Smit case, supra. On the other hand if the extension of time is granted, as was the case in this instance, it might be construed as one of those preliminary questions the registrar is called upon to decide in the course of the opposition proceedings before the final decision."
Mr. Justice Cattanach invited counsel to make further submissions on this point, and the matter came on before him again some two months later. In the second decision, ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 34-36) Cattanach, J., rejected the appeal on two grounds:
(1) The appellant had no standing because at the time the Registrar granted an extension of time there was no lis between the parties; and
(2) the appeal was premature because the decision appealed was not the ultimate or final decision.
[19]
In the present instance there is no lis between the present parties as of the date of the Registrar's grant of a retroactive extension of time.
[20]
As in the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , case, it is also the situation that the Registrar's grant of an extension of time in the present case was not his final determination of the opposition under s. 37 of the Trade Marks Act. Hence, the Registrar's decision to grant a retroactive extension of time cannot be considered a "decision" within the meaning of s. 56 of the Act because it is not a final decision.
[21]
The appellant/applicant is not denied its opportunity to assert and establish its right of appeal, but the opportunity is postponed until the opposition proceedings are completed.
This is consistent with the view taken by the court that it is not prepared to review the myriad of decisions or orders a tribunal must make in the course of the decision-making process until the ultimate decision is reached
.
[22]
In an analogous situation, Walsh, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , found that the Registrar's refusal to allow amendment to a statement of opposition was only an interlocutory decision and was therefore not appealable under s. 56 of the Trade Marks Act.
[23]
Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, an Order will go striking out the document filed by the appellant/applicant entitled "Notice of Appeal and Originating Notice of Motion", with costs to the respondent Canada Packers Inc.
Order accordingly.
