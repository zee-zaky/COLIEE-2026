Teitelbaum, J.
: The plaintiff, William Ronald Logan (Logan), a fisherman, brings this action for the return of the proceeds of the sale of fish, namely halibut and rockfish, allegedly seized by the defendant against the Crown on his own behalf and on behalf of the crew and owner of the commercial fishing vessel, the "Westisle" ("Westisle").
[2]
In his Amended Statement of Claim, the plaintiff, in addition to the claim for the proceeds of the sale of the alleged seized fish, is also claiming for damages, interest and costs.
[3]
At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for plaintiff informed me that he was not claiming any sum of money in excess of the proceeds that were obtained by the Crown as a result of the sale of the fish.
[4]
In plaintiff's Amended Statement of Claim, plaintiff asked for the "return of the proceeds of sale of the halibut". At the commencement of the hearing, this was amended to include the proceeds of the sale of rockfish, in addition to the proceeds from the sale of the halibut.
[5]
After I allowed plaintiff to make the necessary amendment to the Statement of Claim, counsel for the Crown informed me that he had received instructions to concede the plaintiff's claim for the proceeds of the sale of the rockfish for the sum of $562.50 and this, notwithstanding the fact that the said rockfish were caught by Logan and his crew without a licence to do so. More of this later.
[6]
Plaintiff called only one witness, Logan. The defendant called two witnesses, Randy Nelson (Nelson) and Bruce Turris (Turris).
Background
[7]
The facts, generally speaking, are not in dispute. That is to say, there is no dispute on the facts that are relevant in determining the important issues raised by the parties.
[8]
In 1991, a commercial fishing licence, a Category "L" fishing licence, was issued "in respect of" the "Westisle" whose reported vessel owner is British Columbia Packers Limited (B.C. Packers) (see Exhibit D-3).
[9]
This licence permitted the "Westisle" to fish for halibut during 1991 in Canadian fisheries waters off the coast of British Columbia with "hook and line" gear. The "Westisle", according to the licence, was allocated a quota for the 1991 year of 24,796 pounds. The licence states "Quota refers to Halibut IVQ measured in pounds, dressed, fresh, head off weight". IVQ refers to Individual Vessel Quota.
[10]
No commercial fishing licence for rockfish for the 1991 year was issued to the "Westisle".
[11]
The plaintiff claims that on or about June 9, 1991, some 6,788 pounds dressed head off weight of halibut products were seized from the "Westisle" by members of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans as a purported quota overage. The plaintiff asserts that at the time of the alleged seizure, agents of the Crown (which is incorrect) presented the plaintiff, Logan, with a form entitled "Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut" (Exhibit P-1, Tab 6) dated June 9, 1991. The plaintiff also asserts (incorrectly) that he was led to believe that if he signed the Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut form, no criminal or quasi-criminal charges would be brought against him regarding the quote overage.
[12]
The defendant denies the halibut was seized and maintains that the plaintiff forfeited to Her Majesty all claim to the halibut, which exceeded the allowable catch for the "Westisle's" category "L" fishing licence. The defendant claims the relinquishment was in writing and outlined in the document entitled Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut. According to the defendant, Logan was responsible for the operation of the vessel and acknowledged that under trip #01 he exceeded the "L" tab quota by 6,788 pounds. This amount was 21.5% in excess of the quota and therefore Logan agreed to forfeit all claim to the 21.5% of the total value of the halibut to Her Majesty. In this regard, the Crown also relies on the Halibut Individual Vessel Agreement (Exhibit P-1, Tab 5) (the Agreement) made as of April 15, 1991, between Her Majesty, as represented by the Minister of Fisheries and British Columbia Packers Ltd., the owner of the "Westisle". According to the terms of the Agreement, all quantities of halibut which exceeded the IVQ shall not be the property of the vessel owner, but such overage shall be the property of, for the benefit, and under the control of such person or persons as directed by the Minister.
[13]
The halibut was sold by fishery officers, on the Crown's behalf, to S & M Sea Products in Ladner, B.C.
[14]
The plaintiff was subsequently charged under the
Fisheries Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, with exceeding a halibut quota (see Information/Dénonciation, Exhibit P-1, Tab 1). However, the charges were stayed. The plaintiff is of the view that the stay of the charges was an acknowledgment that the quota regime relating to halibut had no legal foundation.
[15]
As the defendant refused to return the proceeds of the sale of the fish, the plaintiff commenced this action for return of the proceeds of the sale of the halibut, damages and interest.
[16]
As I have stated, plaintiff called one witness, William Ronald Logan. Counsel for plaintiff also read into the evidence the questions and answers numbered 7, 9, 10, 22, 24, 63, 66 and 77 from the examination for discovery of Bruce Turris.
[17]
Logan informed the court that he has been a fisherman for 49 years. He is now 68 years old. He thus started fishing at the age of 19. One would believe that after 49 years of fishing, Logan would have had sufficient experience not to overfish to the extent of a 21.5% overage and not to retain possession of rockfish when no licence to catch rockfish was issued to the vessel of which he was Master.
[18]
In his lifetime of fishing, Logan fished for halibut, herring, salmon and tuna in all of the seas and oceans of the world with the exception of the Indian ocean. He fished by seining, trawling and long lining. In 1991, his method of fishing for halibut was long lining, that is, hook and line.
[19]
Logan had himself been a halibut vessel owner. He had sold his own vessel and, in 1991, was fishing with a vessel (the "Westisle") owned by B.C. Packers. The "Westisle" was a 72 foot "long line" vessel of which Logan was the Master.
[20]
Logan informed the court that the licence for 1991 (Exhibit D-3) was arranged for by the vessel owner, B.C. Packers. He stated that he received possession of the licence and other documentation in a sealed manila envelope but did not look at the licence or the other documentation until he left to go fishing. He also stated that before he opened the "sealed manila envelope", he believed that he was in possession of an "L" licence (for halibut) and a "Z" licence for rockfish.
[21]
Logan opened the "sealed manila envelope" when he left port to proceed to the fishing grounds and, I assume, he was surprised he was not in possession of a "Z" licence for rockfish. Nevertheless, knowing he did not have a "Z" licence, he kept what rockfish he and his crew caught. He did have in his possession the "L" licence (Exhibit D-3) and he knew of the quota and knew that the quota for the 1991 year for the "Westisle" was 24,796 pounds (dressed, fresh, head off weight).
[22]
Logan gave evidence as to the type of arrangement that existed between himself, the owner of the vessel and his crew. In addition to the Master (Logan), there were five (5) members of the crew. The arrangement entered into, according to Logan, and I have no reason to doubt Logan on this point, is that the owner of the vessel would receive 25% of the total proceeds of the gross catch of which Logan would receive, what he calls, a bonus of 10% of this 25%, leaving 90% of the 25% for the owner of the vessel. After this sum was deducted from the proceeds of the gross catch, certain expenses, such as food, would be deducted and the balance of the proceeds would be, in the present case, divided equally between the six crew members, which includes the Master. In the event that the remaining proceeds were insufficient to pay for the expenses, it would be the responsibility of the crew to pay for these expenses, each crew member bearing a 1/6 responsibility for the incurred expenses.
[23]
Logan called this type of arrangement a "co-adventure". I was not shown a written agreement and Logan stated that there was no written agreement since most such "arrangements" do not have written agreements.
[24]
There was no evidence to contradict Logan and I am satisfied that Logan, the five member crew and the owner, did enter into such an arrangement which, I am satisfied, can be classified as a "co-adventure" or a "joint venture".
[25]
In giving evidence as to the issue of the quota of halibut that may be caught, Logan stated that it was the first time, in 1991, that a quota was established. That prior to 1991 there was no quota for halibut and one could catch as much halibut as one could but within a specific time frame. Starting in 1991, one could catch halibut during the whole year but not more than an allotted poundage.
[26]
Logan, in trying to explain why he had an overage of halibut, stated that before 1991, when he fished for halibut he had on board his vessel a number of "pens" in which the fish were placed and he would be able to "accurately" estimate the weight of the fish in each "pen". In 1991, the "Westisle" did not have "pens", but had a "slush ice" system which meant that each fish was "dressed" and thrown into the slush ice. "This meant that the crew had to estimate each fish" making the process of estimating the weight of the fish very difficult.
[27]
After 1991, the system to estimate the weight of the fish was changed. The weight now is estimated by measuring each halibut caught and verifying the length with a measurement scale, thereby obtaining a more accurate approximate weight.
[28]
Logan indicated that he stopped fishing when he thought he had reached his quota and returned toward Vancouver from the Queen Charlotte Islands where he had been fishing in the unprotected waters.
[29]
Logan stated that he did not believe he was over the specified quota and testified he "thought right on". For reasons that I will give, I do not accept that Logan did not know, or should not have known, he was over his allowed quota of halibut.
[30]
B.C. Packers, the owner of the vessel informed Logan they did not wish to purchase the fish. B.C. Packers arranged the sale of the fish to S & M Sea Products in Ladner, B.C.
[31]
After Logan had "landed" the vessel in Ladner, he was met by a representative of Archipelago Marine, a private company whose function was to verify licences issued to vessels. The representative of Archipelago Marine is not a representative of the Crown. As the "Westisle" did not have a "Z" licence to catch rockfish and Logan, knowing that he did not have such a licence, caught rockfish, the Archipelago Marine representative contacted the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
[32]
Logan testified that two (2) fisheries officers arrived and questioned him about the "Z" licence. After this, the fish on the vessel were "off loaded" and it was then determined that there was an overage of halibut.
[33]
Logan stated that the representative of Archipelago Marine produced a Relinquishment Claim document "and I signed it with the understanding that this was the end of it". The Relinquishment Claim form is Exhibit P-1, Tab 6. This document is titled Relinquishment of Claim Halibut and is hereunder reproduced. [see page 54].
[34]
Logan explained to the court why he signed the Relinquishment of Claim document Exhibit P-1, Tab 6. He informed me that before signing the form he asked the Archipelago Marine representative what the word "settlement" as used in the form meant. He was told, according to Logan "exactly what it said". Logan then stated that "a couple of days later" he was told that he may be "charged" which, in fact, did happen. Logan added that he was surprised because he believed he would not be charged. The charges, Exhibit P-1, Tab 1, were stayed and therefore, there was no conviction.
[35]
Plaintiff produced, in addition to the Relinquishment Claim document (Exhibit P-1, Tab 6), the Halibut Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) Agreement between Her Majesty the Queen and British Columbia Packers Limited (Exhibit P-1, Tab 5). This Agreement sets the quota of halibut for the 1991 year for the vessel "Westisle" at 24,796 pounds (Appendix A of Exhibit P-1, Tab 5). Paragraph 4 of the said agreement, in speaking of overage, states:
"4.0
OVERAGE
"4.1 The Vessel Owner shall make every effort not to exceed the Licenced Vessel's I.V.Q.
"4.2 The Vessel Owner agrees that any and all quantities of halibut caught which exceed the I.V.Q. shall not be the property of the Vessel Owner or any designate of the Vessel Owner, but such coverage shall be the property of, for the benefit of, and under the control of such person or persons as directed by the Minister.
"4.3 If the licenced Vessel does not have a 'ZN' Rockfish Licence all Quota Rockfish caught, or if the Licenced Vessel does have a 'ZN' Rockfish Licence all Quota Rockfish caught which exceed the terms of allowable catch for the 'ZN' Licence, shall not be the property of the Vessel Owner or any designate of the Vessel Owner, but such overage shall be the property of, for the benefit of and under the control of such person or persons as directed by the Minister.
"4.4 The Vessel Owner acknowledges and agrees that should the Licenced Vessel's allowable catch of halibut or Quota Rockfish be exceeded, in addition to forfeiting any and all overage catch as set out in ss. 4.2 and 4.3 above, the Licenced Vessel's I.V.Q. may be reduced or not reissued and the Vessel Owner or his agents may be charged pursuant to the
Fisheries Act
."
[36]
In his cross-examination, Logan informed me that he was bringing the present action in his own name, on his own behalf, and on behalf of the owner of the "Westisle" and the other members of the crew. He stated that he did not receive written authorization to do so but received verbal authorization from a representative of the owner of the vessel, a Mr. Rick Dunn. He did not say he received authorization from the other members of the crew.
[37]
Exhibit D-1 was produced by the defendant. Exhibit D-1 is a statement dated June 9, 1991 and begins with the words "This is a statement of William Ronald Logan ....". In this statement, he reiterates that he was the "skipper" of the "Westisle", a vessel owned by B.C. Packers. He states that he had been a "skipper" since 1953 and that the June trip was his first on the "Westisle" although he had been with B.C. Packers for eight years. Logan fished for halibut from 1946 to 1966 and from 1981 to 1991. Therefore, in 1991 Logan had fished for halibut for 30 years.
[38]
On this eventful trip in June, Logan indicated in his Statement (Exhibit D-1) that he "brought in" around 27,500 pounds more or less of halibut and probably 3,000 pounds of red snapper and 600 pounds of ling cod". A "Z" licence is required to be permitted to catch red snapper and ling cod and when asked, in the statement if the "Westisle" had a "Z" licence, Logan replies "No it doesn't, not as far as I know". Yet Logan, knowing there was no licence to catch rockfish, red snapper or ling cod did so knowing it was illegal to do so. As will be seen, Logan knew he only had a limit of 24,796 pounds for halibut but admits, in his oral evidence, before the fish was actually weighed, that he brought in what he himself states is approximately 27,500 pounds, some 3,000 pounds over the allowed quota. Logan knew what his quota was as he read, on his way to the fishing ground, so he states, the "L" licence and the IVQ Agreement and he clearly saw what the quota for halibut was. He therefore knew, before returning to Ladner, B.C. that he had overfished.
[39]
In speaking of the Relinquishment of Claim document (Exhibit P-1, Tab 6), Logan stated that he signed the document at or about 6:00 a.m. He again stated, in his cross-examination that he "concedes that there was a halibut overage, that he signed his Statement, Exhibit D-1, during the weighing of the halibut and before he signed the Relinquishment of Claim document (Exhibit P-1, Tab 6).
[40]
Logan testified that although his Statement, Exhibit D-1, is dated June 9, 1994, the correct date is June 8, 1991. Logan was also shown a document titled 1991 Halibut Management Plan April 1991 filed as Exhibit D-2. He admitted to having seen the document and was an observer when the preliminary plan was being drafted. He stated that it was his belief that the plan came into existence because of the request of certain vessel owners. He also stated he did not see the document Exhibit D-1 prior to June 9, 1991.
[41]
Counsel for defendant pointed out to Logan that on his October 26, 1993 examination for discovery, at page 14, questions 79 to 82, he, Logan, had stated he did see Exhibit D-2 and the fishing licence before June 9, 1991 and at question 84 his involvement was more than an observer but not a signatory to the Agreement.
[42]
Furthermore, in his cross-examination, Logan stated that he did not read his Statement (Exhibit D-1) before signing it and "believes" he did not say 27,500 pounds when referring to the halibut catch. I do not accept this as being truthful. I accept the evidence of Mr. Randy Nelson who stated that he had read the statement to Logan before Logan signed it.
[43]
Logan, in his cross-examination, stated and repeated that when he signed Exhibit D-1, his Statement wherein he thought he had brought in 27,500 pounds of halibut and signed Exhibit P-1, Tab 6, the Relinquishment of Claim document, he was aware that Her Majesty was entitled to the overage and thought the matter was concluded. He also admitted that when he signed these documents there was
no discussion with him of criminal charges being brought
pursuant to the
Fisheries Act
and that when he signed these two documents, he did not do so because of anything said to him by any of the fisheries officers. He also admitted to the understanding of the fact that the overage would go to Her Majesty and that Her Majesty could sell the fish and keep the proceeds. Logan conceded that the 1991 Halibut Management Plan, Exhibit D-2, which he stated he did not see before June 9, 1991, but was an observer to its formation stated, at page 5 of 8: "In addition to forfeiting the catch, the licenced vessel's halibut IVQ may be reduced or revoked, and the Vessel Owner or his agents may be charged pursuant to the
Fisheries Act
."
[44]
As I have stated, counsel for plaintiff read into the record questions and answers from an examination for discovery of Bruce Turris.
[45]
In Bruce Turris' examination, in giving answers to questions numbered 7, 9, 10, 22, 24, 63, 66 and 67, Turris stated that at the time in question he was Halibut Coordinator, responsible for the management of the commercial halibut fishery in British Columbia and had been involved in the planning and implementation of the 1991 Halibut IVQ Program. He also stated that part of the appendices found in the IVQ Agreement with B.C. Packers, Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, I assume except for specific fishing quotas, the terms and conditions of these IVQ agreements are identical throughout the halibut fleet and that every vessel owner, as far as he was aware, whose vessel fished for halibut in 1991 had such an agreement in place.
[46]
With regard to the overage of halibut caught by the vessel, Turris stated in his examination for discovery that 6,788 pounds of halibut were sold with all of the other catch and the proceeds for the 6,788 pounds of halibut were paid to the Receiver General of Canada.
[47]
Plaintiff called no other witnesses.
[48]
As I indicated, the defendant called two witnesses, Bruce Turris and Randy Nelson.
[49]
Randy Nelson (Nelson) has been a fisheries officer for 18 years. He stated that on June 9, 1991 he was at Ladner, B.C. as a result of a telephone call from Bruce Turris. Nelson was advised that a vessel, the "Westisle" was off loading at S & M Seafood Products and that it had a quantity of rockfish for which it did not have a licence. At about 11:00 p.m., Nelson arrived with a second fisheries officer at Ladner and found that the "Westisle" was being "off loaded" of its halibut. Nelson then spoke to Logan concerning the rockfish and together with Logan went to his car to obtain a statement, Exhibit D-1.
[50]
Nelson testified that he took Logan's statement on June 9, 1991. The Relinquishment of Claim Halibut document, Exhibit P-1, Tab 6 was signed on June 10, 1991.
[51]
Although Exhibit P-1, Tab 6 is dated June 9, 1991, I am satisfied from the evidence that it was signed on June 10, 1991. The Relinquishment document being signed on the 9th or 10th of June 1991 is immaterial to the outcome of the case.
[52]
Nelson stated, and I have no reason to doubt his evidence, that before he took the Statement (Exhibit D-1) from Logan, he gave Logan the necessary "warning", then asked questions, wrote down the answers,
read back
to Logan what he, Nelson, had written down, asked Logan if any changes were needed, was told no and then had Logan sign the Statement.
[53]
Logan did not make any reply evidence. As I have stated, I see no reason to doubt the evidence of Nelson. Therefore, I am satisfied Logan knew exactly what he signed when he signed Exhibit D-1. Logan knew, before the halibut were weighed, that he had caught more than the quota permitted on the "L" licence when he stated in Exhibit D-1 that he brought in "around 27,500 pounds more or less" and that he knew he had no legal right to "bring in" approximately 3,000 pounds of red snapper and 600 pounds of ling cod in that the vessel had no "Z" licence permitting such a catch.
[54]
Although the legal issues do not depend on what Logan stated, it is apparent that Logan, a fisherman for 49 years, knew he overfished halibut and illegally caught rockfish, and he and others like him wonder why there is a decline in the fish stocks. He and others like him then complain they are unable to earn a living because there is little or no fish left to be caught.
[55]
Nelson stated that the rockfish were seized. With regard to the issue of the substantial overage of halibut, he indicated that Logan was told that a fisheries officer would speak to him as the overage was substantial.
[56]
Logan had been dealing, as regards to the overage of halibut, with Cathy McFee who is not an employee of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans but who, at the time, was a representative of Archipelago Marine, a private company whose function it was to verify fishing licences and issues such as overages and fish caught without a licence. Archipelago Marine was hired and paid by the Fishing Industry, not by the Crown.
[57]
Nelson was present when Logan signed the Relinquishment of Claim document. He stated that no pressure was exerted on Logan to sign the document. I accept this statement.
[58]
Nelson added that it is his opinion that a fisheries officer has a legal right to seize fish but not to declare the fish forfeited.
[59]
Bruce Ryan Turris is employed in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans as Manager, Groundfish Management Unit. In 1991, he was halibut coordinator. His duties consisted of preparing a Management Plan for the fisheries as well as being responsible for the day-to-day management of the fisheries in British Columbia.
[60]
Exhibit D-2, the 1991 Halibut Management Plan is one "product" of the witness' duties. After being shown Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, the Halibut Individual Vessel Quota Agreement dated April 15, 1991 between the Crown and B.C. Packers Limited, the owner of the vessel the "Westisle", he informed the court that he played a role in negotiating this Agreement. He stated that the IVQ Agreement, Exhibit P-1, Tab 5 and the 1991 Halibut Management Plan, Exhibit D-2, are part of a "package" to manage the halibut fishery. He explained that prior to 1991 the fishing "season" consisted of two (2) or three (3) openings and closings with no limit of catch. This resulted in both small and large fish being caught and kept; large quantities of fish were caught and a poor quality of fish were also caught. He testified, I believe, that this resulted in a possible depletion of the fish stocks and lower prices for the halibut. He explains that in 1988 the Pacific Trawlers Association asked the Crown to investigate the possibility of a different way to approach the fishery. In September of 1989, a discussion paper was sent to all licence owners, after which meetings and discussions took place. Seventy-five per cent or more of the licence owners were in favour of a conservation concept and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans established a Halibut Advisory Committee. The Department then negotiated an allocation program with an advisory committee which consisted, primarily, of vessel owners and various other groups, including fishermen.
[61]
Some fishermen were against quotas as, I assume, this would mean a smaller income. They obviously, as Mr. Logan, were not concerned with the long term effect of overfishing. This is very obvious in the case of Logan in that, even after the Plan went into effect, he, I am satisfied, knowingly and wilfully overfished halibut and caught rockfish without a licence to do so.
[62]
In any event, in June of 1990, a Plan was prepared and mailed to all the "L" licence holders. The Plan identified each vessel and showed the quota allowed the specific vessel. In a vote, over 70% of the licence holders responded and of that 70% 70% were in favour of the Plan on a two year trial basis.
[63]
The IVQ Agreement, an example of which is Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, required Dock Side Monitoring, obviously for persons such as Mr. Logan. The industry itself provided the funds to monitor the Agreement. The IVQ Agreements were only negotiated with licence owners. Exhibit P-1, Tab 5 is the IVQ Agreement negotiated with B.C. Packers, the owner of the "Westisle". Appendix "A" contains the 1991 IVQ information for the "Westisle", it, as previously stated, shows a quota for 1991 of 24,796 pounds for halibut. Appendix "B" to the Agreement gives the 1991 specific fees payable by the owner of the "Westisle".
[64]
According to Turris, the IVQ program was linked to the halibut fishing licence. Exhibit D-3, the "Westisle's" fishing licence, is to be read with Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, Appendix "A" in relation to the maximum amount of halibut the "Westisle" was entitled to catch in 1991. [see page 55]
[65]
It must be noted that both the IVQ Agreement, Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, and the "L" licence clearly indicate the quota for the "Westisle" to be 24,796 pounds for 1991.
[66]
Turris, in explaining the Relinquishment of Claim Halibut document, Exhibit P-1, Tab 6, informed the court that he had seen other similar documents, that it arose as a result of each owner agreeing to an individual vessel quota and that any poundage caught over the agreed quota would be relinquished to the Crown. Turris went on to explain that if there was an overage of halibut caught, the "observer" (not a fisheries officer but an individual from private industry, in this case Cathy McFee of Archipelago Marine) would submit the Relinquishment document for signature and that it was understood that by signing the Relinquishment document, the individual signing it had
no
claim to the fish (or proceeds) that was over the quota limit. The fish was relinquished to the Crown.
[67]
Turris stated the "overage" of fish was sold and the proceeds were received by the Crown. The proceeds were not used for the IVQ program.
[68]
In cross-examination, Turris admitted that in 1991, the first year of the program, there were "teething problems" and it was difficult for fishermen to know the precise weight of fish caught and that the "weighing" had to be estimated.
[69]
There is no doubt this is correct but, as I have said and now repeat, a fisherman of 49 years of experience, a fisherman with Logan's experience as owner and as Master of a halibut fishing vessel, would surely know that he caught too much fish so as to be 21.5% over his quota and would surely know he could not catch and keep rockfish for which he had no licence. Logan surely knew he had an overage when he signed his Statement (Exhibit D-1) as he himself admits to believing he had 27,500 pounds of halibut
before
the halibut was weighed.
[70]
Turris, in explaining why the charges against Logan were stayed, testified that the manner of dealing with overages was changed for subsequent years, the overage weight was deducted from the vessel's quota for the subsequent year, it was decided to stay the charges against Logan. I am satisfied this does not mean Logan is not guilty of overfishing or fishing without a licence.
[71]
Turris also informed the court that before the issuance of an "L" licence to an owner, the IVQ Agreement was sent to the owner and had to be signed by the owner. The owner had to agree that the vessel owner "may catch up to, but no more than the IVQ as set out in Appendix A".
[72]
The Crown had no other witnesses. The plaintiff did not make any reply evidence.
Issues
1)
Standing or Status
of plaintiff to bring the present action;
2)
The enforceability
of Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, The IVQ Agreement, Exhibit P-1, Tab 6, the Relinquishment of Claim Halibut document, Exhibit D-2, the 1991 Halibut Management Plan, Exhibit D-3, the "L" licence and the
Fisheries Act
;
3)
The overage of halibut
, was it seized, sold and forfeited by the defendant or did Logan relinquish the overage of the halibut to the Crown for himself only or on behalf of all parties.
[73]
Plaintiff's position may be summarized as follows.
[74]
The seizure of the halibut was wrongful, on the basis that the "Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut" document and the IVQ Agreement, dated April 15, 1991, are illegal, unenforceable, null and void, and of no force and effect as it was signed under a mistake of fact or under a mistake of law, or both.
[75]
In the further alternative, the plaintiff maintains that the "Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut" document is unenforceable, null and void, and of no force or effect as it fails for want of consideration.
[76]
The plaintiff also argues that the "Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut" document is unenforceable, null and void, and is of no force or effect as it was signed by the plaintiff under duress.
[77]
Defendant's position may be summarized as follows.
[78]
The defendant challenges the status and standing of the plaintiff to bring the action on behalf of the crew or the owner of the "Westisle". The defendant also argues that the plaintiff has no standing to challenge the legal validity of either the "Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut" or the "Halibut Individual Vessel Quote Agreement" documents.
[79]
The defendant's position is basically that the plaintiff has no right to the proceeds of the halibut, which exceeded the allowable catch for the "Westisle's" category "L" licence. The defendant argues that as a result of the "Relinquishment of Claim, Halibut" document, the halibut which exceeded the said allowable catch was forfeited to Her Majesty. The document provides as follows:
"I, Bill Logan, responsible for the operation of the above named vessel, acknowledge that under Trip #01 I exceeded the 'L' Tab #024 quota by 6788 lbs. dressed head off weight. I agree that the amount of this excess is equivalent to 21.5 percent (%) of all halibut products verified for trip #01 and hereby forfeit all claim to 21.5 percent (%) of the total value of these halibut products to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada."
[80]
The defendant maintains the plaintiff has no claim against Her Majesty and is estopped from asserting a claim for relief.
[81]
The defendant also relies on the Halibut Individual Quota Agreement, particularly paragraphs 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, which are reproduced on page 9 of these Reasons.
[82]
The defendant maintains the documents are legally enforceable and vires the
Fisheries Act
and
Regulations
.
Standing
[83]
Logan gave evidence, and he was not contradicted, that he, together with the vessel's owner and five crew members had entered into a joint venture whereby the proceeds of a particular fishing trip would be divided in different percentages for the vessel owner, the Master and the crew.
[84]
On the issue of a "joint venture", plaintiff submitted the British Columbia Supreme Court case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, the issue before Mr. Justice Rae was the issue of whether there existed an employer-employee relationship. On the issue of "joint-venture" or "co-adventure", Mr. Justice Rae, at pages 398, 399 and 400 stated:
"The crews on the vessels in question engage in trawl fishing on a share basis. The crews are generally four or five men, including the captain. Under the agreement with respect to shares the catch is taken to the shore plant where it is sold, e.g., the Prince Rupert Fishermen's Cooperative Association. The latter as part of its operation as a processing plant operates a settlement service whereby it accounts to the owner and crew of a vessel in respect of the sale of the catch. By agreement between all parties concerned, from the proceeds of the catch, the 'gross stock' , there are deducted certain costs, including costs for ice, fuel and lubrication. From what is then left there is taken a percentage share, generally 40 per cent, for the boat, which goes to the boat owner. From the remainder, i.e., the 'net stock credit', there are then deducted certain other costs including, principally, the cost of food for the crew on the trip and after such deduction the remaining balance is divided equally amongst the crew, which includes the captain. If the owner is part of the crew as captain or otherwise he also gets his equal share of this last.
"If there is a loss on a trip there is incurred a 'hole' bill which is charged to the crew in equal shares, i.e., in the same manner as they are the 'net stock' proceeds. A full accounting with respect to the proceeds of a catch, incorporating all the matters referred to, is made to the owner and to the crew, including the captain.
"On these facts, and after a full review of the relevant evidence before me, I find as a fact that the crew are not employees of the owner of the vessel and are not in an employer-employee (master-servant) relationship with the owner.
They are engaged in a joint venture
. Whether or not a master-servant relationship exists is a question of fact. See 25
Halsbury
, 3rd Ed., p. 447. See also
Re Lunenberg Sea Products Ltd.; Re Zwicker
, 21 MPR 305; [1947] 3 DLR 195 (a decision of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court 'in banco') at pp. 203 et seq., in which a similar finding was made in very similar circumstances.
"On a ship at sea the captain exercises a large measure of control but that control is ex necessitate by the very nature of the venture and in the interests of the well-being of all. Even if he happens also to be owner he exercises his control qua captain. I quote from the
Lunenberg
case, supra, per Doull, J., (with those reasons the other members of the court agreed), at p. 206:
'To my mind the persons in question in the present case were engaged in procuring fish not for the owners or for the captain but for the general account of all. They had agreed with the owners that such a man should be captain and that they should stay on the ship for the voyage and "pursue the cod" but neither captain nor owner had any right to take them or the ship to any place except the well-known fishing grounds without their further consent. The captain was made their agent to sell the fish when caught and to make out the account, but the fish belonged to no one before it was caught and it never belonged to the owner of the ship unless and until he bought it - if in fact he did.
'It is true that the master was in charge of the ship and the persons in question had agreed to man it, but this was incidental to the main purpose of the voyage and as prescribed by law.
'When I apply these principles to the present facts, I am of opinion that the relationship between the fishermen who share in the proceeds of a fishing voyage under the agreements before us and the owners of the vessels is not that of employer and employee
but of partnership in the limited sense which is sometimes described as a "joint adventure"
.'" (underlining is mine)
[85]
I take from the above the fact that where, as in the case before me, there is a sharing of a catch, there exists a
partnership in a limited sense
, the "partnership in a limited sense" being a partnership for only that specific voyage where the parties in the said "partnership" agree to be responsible for any losses and agree to share the profits in whatever proportion they agree to.
[86]
Rule 1708 of the
Federal Court Rules
provides that:
"A statement of claim or declaration shall show the capacity in which a plaintiff sues if he is suing in a representative capacity, and the capacity in which a defendant is sued if he is sued in a representative capacity."
[87]
Rule 1711 provides for representative and class actions, specifically 1711(1) stated:
"(1) Where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding, the proceeding may be begun, and unless the court otherwise orders, continued, by or against any one or more of them representing all or as representing all except one or more of them."
[88]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Denault, J., discussed the requirements for what he described as a class action at page 311:
"The plaintiffs' statement of claim describes the proposed class of plaintiffs to this action as including all 'farmers, borrowers from the F.C.C. who have been, are or may be in financial difficulty'.
"For a matter to be appropriate for the institution of a class action, the persons in the class must have a common interest and a common grievance. Furthermore, the relief sought must in its nature be beneficial to all members of the class, or as it has sometimes been described, 'if the plaintiffs win, all win.' ...
"Rule 1711 requires that the plaintiffs and those they seek to represent have the 'same interest' in the proceedings. In the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted this term to mean the plaintiffs must all have the
same interest in the outcome of the judgment
.
. . . . .
"It is the opinion of this court that, in order to satisfy the requirements of having 'the same interest in the outcome of the judgment', the relief sought by a class of plaintiffs must, at the very least, have a practical impact on each of the members of the class."
[89]
Although Denault, J., made reference to a class action, I believe his comments regarding rule 1711 apply to representative actions. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Estey, J., commented at page 78 that the term "class action" is an ambiguous term embracing derivative actions and "representative actions by persons having the same interest in the subject of the litigation which is brought under the leadership of one or more representatives". Estey, J., in his reasons referred to the action, for simplicity's sake as a "class action".
[90]
The difference between the two actions was discussed by MacFarlane, J.A., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), at page 408:
"It is necessary to consider the difference between a class action which is derivative in nature, and a representative action by persons having the same interest in the subject of the litigation. Derivative type class actions are those in which a wrong is done to the entity to which the members belong. Such an action may be brought on behalf of the entity. A representative action can be brought by persons asserting a common right, and even where persons may have been wronged in their individual capacity."
[91]
As the
Federal Court Rules
do not really address the interest required to bring a representative action, MacFarlane, J.A.'s, comments relating to the comparable B.C. Supreme Court Rule may be of some assistance (at the time, the wording of rule 5(11) was similar to the wording of rule 1711(1)). MacFarlane, J.A., identified the following three sub-issues under rule 5(11):
"1) Is the purported class capable of clear and definitive definition?
"2) Are the principal issues of fact and law essentially the same as regard all members of the class? and
"3) Assuming liability, is there a single measure of damages applicable to all members?"
[92]
As noted above, the leading case on the application of the same interest test is the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In reviewing the history of the representative action, Estey, J., at page 79 referred to the following quotation from
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at page 8:
"Given a common interest and a common grievance, a representative suit was in order if the relief sought was in its nature beneficial to all whom the plaintiff proposed to represent."
[93]
Estey, J., also referred to the B.C. Court of Appeal's decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 254:
"... a class action is appropriate where if the plaintiff wins the other persons he purports to represent win too, and if he, because of that success, becomes entitled to relief whether or not in a fund or property, the others also become likewise entitled to that relief, having regard, always, for different quantative participants."
[94]
Representative action involving the creation of a common fund was also discussed by Estey, J., at page 84 of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :
"There was there a 'fund' or common asset of finite proportions determinable without a series of individual damage or other assessment proceedings. There may, of course, be some hearing, with or without evidence, to determine proportionate interests as between claimants on the common fund, but this is a process quite separate and distinct in character from the hearing to determine the finite common fund or asset sought to be recovered in toto by a representative action for the class as a whole."
[95]
From the above and from the facts of the case before me, I am satisfied that Logan is permitted to have commenced a representative action for himself, the owner of the vessel and the members of the crew as they all have a common interest and a common grievance. I am also satisfied that the "joint venture" undertaken by Logan, the vessel owner and the crew, for the purposes of the one specific voyage which is before me, a "partnership in a limited sense" and, as a result, all "partners" are responsible, to third persons for the actions of the partnership, in this case, the signing of the Relinquishment of Claim Halibut document Exhibit P-1, Tab 6 by Logan. In addition, Logan, as Master of the "Westisle", would, as well, bind the vessel owner and the crew for matters within his power as Master.
Forfeiture - Seizure - Relinquishment
[96]
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted the case of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), as the basis for his submission that the seizure of the halibut was ultra vires the power of the defendant.
[97]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a fisherman claimed reimbursement, or in the alternative damages, for the value of unshucked scallops returned to the sea on the orders of fishery officers after the fisherman's vessel was seized for an alleged fishing offence. The plaintiff was subsequently acquitted of the fishing offence. MacKay, J., thoroughly reviewed the relevant sections of the
Fisheries Act
, namely ss. 71 through 77 and made the following comments regarding forfeiture at page 7:
"... Section 71 of the
Act
provides for seizure of boats, gear and fish in circumstances where it appears to fishery officers that a fisherman has acted in contravention of the
Act
or the
Regulations
. Under s. 71(2), (3) and (4) the
Act
requires, subject to ss. 72 and 73, that anything seized be retained in custody, unless the thing seized is perishable in which event it may be sold with the proceeds of the sale paid to the Receiver General. Section 72 provides for forfeiture of those things seized only in two circumstances. One of those, under s. 72(2), where ownership of the thing seized cannot, at the time of seizure, be ascertained, is not relevant here.
The only other provision for forfeiture under s. 72(1) is where a court orders forfeiture, following conviction of an offence under the
Act
or
Regulations
. Under s. 72(3), where a prosecution has been instituted anything seized and not forfeited to the Crown under s. 72(2) may be released upon security posted by a satisfactory bond. Section 72(4) provides for return of anything seized, or the proceeds of any sale of seized goods, if the Minister decides not to prosecute in relation to an alleged offence, or in any event three months after seizure unless a prosecution has been instituted.
"In this case there was no conviction and no order of forfeiture. The plaintiff was thus entitled to the return of the things seized or the proceeds from their sale pursuant to s. 73(3). That provision directs that, in the circumstances here, the goods seized and not ordered forfeited, or the proceeds of any sale, be returned to the person from whom they were taken." (underlining is mine)
[98]
MacKay, J., continued at pages 8 and 9:
"These provisions and the process established by them, reflect the concern of Parliament to balance the general public interest in conservation of fisheries, an underlying purpose of the
Act
, and the interest of the individual from whom goods are seized or anyone else interested in the equipment and the catch where those have been forfeited to the Crown. Thus, when it appears to a fishery officer that fishing is unlawful, or some other violation of the
Act
and
Regulations
has occurred, he may exercise the extraordinary discretion to seize a boat, its gear and fish caught but he then has the responsibility to maintain goods seized in custody, unless they are perishable, and to return them, or if perishable and sold, to see to the return of their proceeds, if there is no conviction and no forfeiture. Seizure in itself does not vest in the Crown any interest in the goods seized, except where the officer cannot determine the owner at the time goods are seized. In all other cases there is no forfeiture to the Crown without a court order following conviction. And as we have seen, even after forfeiture, a person other than one convicted or from whom the goods are seized, may apply to a court for an order concerning an interest claimed in the goods forfeited.
"... In the result, by seizure and disposal of the plaintiff's property, the scallops in the shell, in circumstances not authorized by Parliament, their action resulted in the wrong or tort of conversion, for which the plaintiff is entitled to recover the full value of the scallops in the shell ...."
[99]
It should be noted that in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the plaintiff was acquitted of the fishery offence, there was no conviction and therefore there could be no order of forfeiture.
[100]
In the case at bar, as a result of the stay granted Logan, there was no order of forfeiture pursuant to the
Fisheries Act
.
[101]
The defendant submitted that in the case at bar there was no seizure of halibut. defendant stated, and I agree with this submission, that the overage of halibut was not seized by the defendant. Logan, validly acting on behalf of the "partnership" signed, without duress, the Relinquishment document.
[102]
It is clear that had the defendant seized and caused the overage of halibut to be forfeited, the forfeiture would have been invalid as forfeiture may only be effected pursuant to the provisions of the
Fisheries Act
as stated by Mr. Justice MacKay in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case (supra). There is no doubt that in the case before me, Logan was not convicted for having "overfished" halibut nor was he convicted for catching rockfish without a licence nor did a court order the forfeiture of the fish. The fact that the vessel owner B.C. Packers signed the IVQ Agreement is immaterial insofar as the Agreement relates to the issue of "forfeiture" in paragraph 4
as forfeiture can only take effect pursuant to the provisions of the
Fisheries Act
.
[103]
I am satisfied that the defendant when signing an IVQ Agreement with all of the "L" licence holders and making the issue of quota and forfeiture a condition that a licence holder must agree to before a licence would issue, is setting conditions that are legislative in nature, not administrative in nature. The defendant is, by so doing, attempting to regulate the entire industry with regard to the issue of forfeiture by means of individual agreements.
[104]
I am satisfied that the defendant is attempting to do indirectly what normally defendant could only do pursuant to the provisions of the
Fisheries Act
.
[105]
As I have stated, I am satisfied that the signing of the Relinquishment of Claim document, Exhibit P-1, Tab 6, did not and does not effect a forfeiture. I am also satisfied from the evidence before me that Logan was not promised anything if he signed the Relinquishment document nor was he put under any duress to sign the document. I am also satisfied that the Relinquishment document is not a contract whereby Logan had to receive "consideration" and should the document be considered a contract, Logan received "consideration" in that he knowingly, I am satisfied, overfished and was "hoping" by being very cooperative, that no charges would be brought against him. This is the consideration for Logan voluntarily signing the Relinquishment of Claim document.
[106]
As I have stated, the IVQ Agreement, Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, is signed between Her Majesty the Queen and B.C. Packers. Although the Agreement speaks of "overage" and of "forfeiting any and all overage catch" it does not speak of a Relinquishment of Claim document. This Relinquishment of Claim document is separate and apart of the IVQ Agreement.
[107]
Of course, all the documents, the IVQ Agreement, the "L" licence, the Relinquishment of Claim, the Halibut Management Plan make up a "package" to manage the halibut fishery but each document is separate and apart from the other, with each document being prepared for a specific different purpose.
[108]
The Relinquishment document, Exhibit P-1, Tab 6 was not signed by the defendant nor was the defendant a party to the document. It is a document signed by a representative of the Fishing Industry and Logan and is prepared specifically so that the fish would not be forfeited but "given up" because of an overage. If an overage is to be forfeited it can only be done pursuant to the sections of the
Fisheries Act
.
Conclusion
[109]
For the above reasons, I am satisfied that Logan is permitted to institute a representative action. I am also satisfied that the "co-adventure" or "joint-venture" of the present case is a "partnership in a limited sense" with the result that Logan was able to bind the partnership in relinquishing the overage of halibut notwithstanding the fact that the document stated "By these presents, on my behalf or on ...." and does not state on behalf of his "partners". It is plaintiff's counsel that made the submission that the "joint venture" is a partnership. This being so, Logan was able to sign, as Master and as a "partner" a document relinquishing 21.5% of the total value of these halibut products to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.
[110]
I also find paragraph 4 of Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, insofar as it relates to forfeiture, to be ultra vires the power of the Crown in that "overages" can only be forfeited pursuant to the relevant sections of the
Fisheries Act
.
[111]
As previously stated at trial, plaintiff amended the Amended Statement of Claim to include a claim for the value of the rockfish caught, seized and forfeited by and to the Crown. The Crown conceded this issue. Therefore, the defendant is ordered to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $562.50 with interest from the 30th day of November, 1994 with no costs, this claim being made at the time of trial.
[112]
With regard to plaintiff's claim for the value of the fish relinquished pursuant to the Relinquishment of Claim document Exhibit P-1, Tab 5, same is dismissed with costs in favour of defendant.
Judgment for plaintiff in part.
