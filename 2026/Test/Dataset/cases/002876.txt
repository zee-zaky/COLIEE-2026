Jerome, A.C.J.
: This application seeks an order of mandamus and prohibition directing the Registrar of Trademarks to decide the within opposition proceeding on the basis of the original trademark application and to refuse to accept the "Substitute Application" filed by Gamble Foods Ltd. on August 5, 1986. The matter came on for hearing at Toronto, Ontario, on November 24, 1986.
[2]
The facts are not in dispute. On September 19, 1977, Gamble Foods Ltd. filed an application to register the trademark RONALD'S with the Canadian Trade Marks Office. This application was based on the use of the trademark in Canada since February 24, 1977, in association with various food products. In 1981 a statement of opposition was filed by McDonald's Corporation and was answered by a counter statement from Gamble. Further evidence and written arguments followed.
[3]
On December 11, 1984, the President of Gamble wrote to the Register of Trademarks notifying him of some amendments he wished to make to his application. That letter stated:
"In the United States Trademark registration application, a technical defense was raised by the McDonald's Corporation at the last moment (in their brief filed Nov. 19/84 after all testimony was completed) that Gamble Foods Ltd. had been removed from the corporate rolls in Canada for a short period in 1977 (copy of certificates attached). As a result the United States registration was void (under U.S. law) and it has become necessary to withdraw and then refile a new U.S. application. Priority in Canada was claimed on the United States application.
"Under these circumstances I hereby amend my Canadian application, filed September 19/77 by deleting the reference to priority and insert a date of ACTUAL USE in Canada of June 16, 1978. A copy of an invoice, and label from Gamble Foods Ltd. (a company properly on the rolls at the time) to Little Oly's Coffee shop, Vancouver, B.C. is attached in support of this amendment.
"A copy of my Withdrawal of Trademark registration application in the United States is also attached."
It was signed by Ronald K. Gamble and a copy sent to the opponent's solicitors.
[4]
The Registrar replied in a letter dated January 4, 1985:
"Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of December 11, 1984.
"From a review of your letter of December 11, it would appear that the applicant wishes to amend its application:
(1) to delete paragraph 5 of the application to remove the claim to priority based on the applicant's United States application, and
(2) to change the date of first use from February 24, 1977, to June 16, 1978.
"The first amendment is permissible but the second amendment cannot be made because Rule 37(b) of the Trade Marks Rules prohibits amending an application after advertisement to change a date of first use.
"If the applicant wishes to proceed with its first amendment, it will be necessary to submit a revised application and the applicant will have one month from the date of this letter within which to do so."
It does not appear that a revised application was submitted at this time. No appeal was taken from the ruling expressed in this letter and the Registrar was not requested to reconsider. In November 1985, the filed written arguments were forwarded by the Registrar to each party and in January 1986, he was advised that neither party requested an oral hearing. With these steps the opposition proceeding was complete and ready for a final decision from the Registrar.
[5]
On July 18, 1986, the Registrar wrote again to Gamble Foods Ltd. on the issue of the amendments to the application:
"In reviewing the above-noted file, it has come to my attention that there is a potential error in my letter of January 4, 1985, respecting the applicant's request to amend its application dated December 11, 1984. The applicant's request to change its date of first use to June 16, 1978, was arguably a request to amend the basis of the application to proposed use since the new date of first use is subsequent to the filing date of the application. In view of the decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), such an amendment is permissible. The Hardee's decision is authority for the proposition that it is permissible to amend the basis of an application from actual use in Canada to proposed use in Canada.
"In view of the foregoing, and in view of the fact that the potential error in my letter of January 4, 1985, may have an impact on the present opposition, the applicant will have one month from the date of this letter to amend the basis of its application to proposed use, if it so elects. If the applicant elects to revise its application, the opponent will be given an opportunity to file a further revised statement of opposition. Furthermore, if necessary, provision will be made for the filing of additional evidence and argument."
[6]
In response to this letter, Gamble submitted on August 5, 1986, a "Substitute Application" in the appropriate form for registration of a proposed trademark. The application also provided that it was being submitted "for that application previously filed in [sic] September 19, 1977, file No. 415,481 to amend the basis of that application to proposed use". The last line stated: "Actual use of the trademark in Canada commenced on June 16, 1978".
[7]
As promised in the letter of July 18, 1986, the Registrar then wrote to McDonald's enclosing the amended application and giving the opponent one month to file an amended statement of opposition.
[8]
McDonald's brings this motion to prohibit the Registrar from accepting the "Substitute Application" and to compel him to decide the opposition proceeding on the basis of the evidence before him as of January 1986. Specifically, the applicants argue:
1) The respondent, the Registrar of Trademarks was without jurisdiction to make the decision of July 18, 1986, as he was functus officio on this issue.
2) The applicants were denied natural justice by the respondent, the Registrar of Trademarks, as they were not given an opportunity to be heard prior to the decision of July 18, 1986.
3) In any event, the "Substitute Application" filed by the respondent, Gamble Foods Ltd. on August 5, 1986, did not comply with the decision of the Registrar of July 18, 1986.
4) The decision of the respondent, the Registrar of Trademarks, of July 18, 1986, to permit the amendment of an application after advertisement to change to proposed use basis was wrong in law.
[9]
The statutory provisions relevant to this application are ss. 35 to 38 of the Trade Marks Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1559:
"Amendment of Applications for Registration
"35. Except as provided in sections 36 and 37, an application may be amended, either before or after advertisement.
"36. An application for the registration of a trademark may not be amended at any time
(a) to change the identity of the applicant, except after recognition of a transfer by the Registrar;
(b) to change the trademark except in respects that do not alter its distinctive character or affect its identity;
(c) to change a date of first use or making known in Canada of the trademark to an earlier date, except on evidence satisfactory to the Registrar that the change is justified by the facts;
(d) to change the application from one not alleging use or making known the trademark in Canada before the filing of the application to one alleging such use or making known; or
(e) to extend the statement of wares or services.
"37. An application for the registration of a trademark may not be amended after advertisement
(a) to change the trademark; or
(b) to change a date of first use or making known in Canada of the trademark.
"38. The Registrar may, by certificate, correct any error in any instrument of record which he is satisfied is a clerical error."
[10]
The applicant asks me to find that, in accordance with the doctrine of functus officio, the Registrar, having made the determination that the proposed amendment could not be made, was without authority to make a later decision to the contrary. The doctrine applies to judicial decisions which, for obvious reasons, once made cannot be altered. To apply it in this case, I would have to be satisfied that the Registrar's letter of January 4, 1985, was such a decision and that it was altered by the letter of July 18, 1986.
[11]
Counsel for the applicant refers to a decision of this court,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), in which the Registrar was prevented from extending the time for opposition on an application he had already allowed. In that case a third party had applied for an extension of time for the filing of an opposition. The Registrar had not dealt with the request until after the trademark application was allowed. He had then attempted to grant the extension, refusing to register the allowed application. In a brief judgment, Mr. Justice Collier pointed out that the situation was covered by s. 38(2) of the Trade Marks Act, which specifically states that the Registrar shall not extend the time for filing a statement of opposition with respect to any application that has been allowed. It is true, therefore, that the Registrar was found to be without jurisdiction to rescind his earlier decision allowing the application, but the reason for the lack of jurisdiction was not that the Registrar was functus officio, but that he had waited too long to act upon the request for an extension of time and was consequently prevented from doing so by s. 38(2).
[12]
The question of whether administrative tribunals have inherent power to review and reconsider their own decisions has been considered in a number of decisions of this court.
[13]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Walsh of this court dealt with the powers of the Petroleum Compensation Board established under the Petroleum Administration Act and related regulations, and those of its predecessor, the Energy Supplies Allocation Board. These Boards were established to administer the Petroleum Products Compensation Program, which compensated Canadian oil refiners for imports of petroleum under certain circumstances. The Boards were empowered by the relevant legislation to "... authorize the payment to the eligible importer of import compensation pursuant to these Regulations in an amount determined by the board in respect of that purchase of petroleum". (Oil Import Compensation Regulations (SOR/74-627) s. 4(1)). In an earlier decision,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court of Appeal found these powers to be of a purely administrative nature, conferring no capacity to "adjudicate". Specifically, the Board was found to be entitled to determine only the amount of compensation it could authorize, not whether the importer was eligible for compensation in the first place. On page 378, Chief Justice Jackett stated:
"... I am of the view that the Board has a responsibility, before authorizing a payment, to satisfy itself concerning all conditions precedent to that payment and that what it is required to 'determine' under the Regulations is the amount of import compensation that it can authorize to be paid and not the amount of the applicant's entitlement to import compensation. In other words, in my view, an applicant who satisfies the conditions is entitled to an amount to be determined in accordance with the Regulations and, if the matter gets before the courts in the event of a dispute as to the amount, the court is not bound by the Board's determination."
[14]
In the Irving Oil case, Mr. Justice Walsh relied on this finding to hold that the Petroleum Compensation Board as an administrative body was not subject to the doctrine of functus officio.
[15]
An examination of the relevant statute in this case supports the same result. The wording of ss. 35 to 37 leaves no room for an adjudicative or discretionary power on the part of the Registrar except in certain specified areas. The sections provide:
1) that an amendment may be made unless it falls under sections 36 or 37;
2) that an amendment may not be made if it falls within one of the categories listed in those two sections; and
3) that the Registrar has discretion to allow an amendment only if it falls under s. 36(c) (changing the date of first use to an earlier date) or s. 38 (correcting clerical errors).
[16]
If the applicant complies with these conditions, the statute entitles him to make his amendment. The Registrar's function of confirming that the conditions have been complied with is a purely administrative one. It is not determinative of rights in any final sense, and therefore not subject to the doctrine of functus officio.
[17]
I turn now to the submission that the failure to hear the applicants prior to the decision of July 18, 1986, constitutes a denial of natural justice. It is clear that even in a purely administrative process parties whose rights are affected are entitled to be treated fairly. In this regard it should be remembered that the applicants here were a third party to the decisions of January 4, 1985, and July 18, 1986, which presumably affected the rights of Gamble, the trademark applicant, much more closely. Possible prejudice to McDonald's, the opponent, was limited to delay (for a possible total of two months) and the necessity of meeting a new case (which amounted only to a priority date six months later than the previous one). The opponent was given an additional month in which to file an amended opposition.
[18]
To determine whether McDonald's was treated fairly, it is important to understand the nature of the decision that was communicated by the letter of July 18, 1986. The applicants would have me believe that this is a reversal of the initial ruling in the January 4, 1985 letter. On the contrary, I find the July 18 letter to be a confirmation and clarification of that ruling. The first letter stated that the date of first use could not be changed after the application had been advertised. The second letter did not change this statement but merely added that this did not mean that the basis of the application could not be changed from one of prior use to one of proposed use. This statement was made, as the letter indicates, in light of the decision of this court to that effect in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The Registrar was endeavouring to ensure that his ruling had not been interpreted in a way which was contrary to the court's interpretation of ss. 35 to 37.
[19]
The question of procedural fairness in connection with a new interpretation of a statute also came up in the Irving Oil case. Mr. Justice Walsh held:
"Finally, dealing with the question of fairness, it cannot be concluded from the mere fact that applicant by the new interpretation is now found to be entitled to less compensation for the years 1974 to 1978 than under the former interpretation, that it has not been dealt with fairly.
It is not unfair to apply a law or regulation properly nor to correct an erroneous interpretation which was made in the past
, ..." (my underlining)
If it is fair to correct a genuinely erroneous interpretation, surely it is also fair to clarify a correct interpretation so that it does not produce an erroneous conclusion. In addition, as the Registrar had no option but to follow the court's interpretation of the statute, it is difficult to see what could have been accomplished by his hearing the opponent before he corrected the potential error.
[20]
The applicants also argue that Gamble's "Substitute Application" does not simply comply with the Registrar's letter of July 18, 1986, but instead constitutes an attempt to change the date of first use contrary to s. 37(b) of the Regulations. I cannot accept this argument. The "Substitute Application" follows Form 4 of the Trade Marks Regulations which is to be used for applications based on proposed use. It is true that the final line states: "Actual use of the trademark in Canada commenced on June 16, 1978" which appears, on the face of it, to be inconsistent with proposed use. Under the rather unusual circumstances of this case, however, it is understandable that the trademark applicant would word his application in this way. In any event, that last line is irrelevant to the amended application. Section 16(3) of the Act provides that the relevant priority date for a mark based on proposed use is the date the application was filed, in this case September 19, 1977. That is the date as of which the opponents have to prove that the proposed trademark was confusing with a mark already in use. The "Substitute Application" does not rely on a new date of first use. Instead by changing the basis of the application to proposed use, it changes the priority date from the date of first use to the date of filing. This is what the letter of July 18, 1986, informed the applicant he could do.
[21]
Finally, the applicants contend that the decision to allow the change to proposed use was wrong in law. First of all, as this is not an appeal from the Registrar's decision, I am not sure that this argument is relevant to these proceedings. On an application for prerogative relief, my concerns are limited to whether the Registrar properly exercised his jurisdiction and whether there has been a denial of natural justice or fairness. As long as these conditions have been fulfilled, the Registrar may be entitled to be wrong in law until he has been appealed. But without deciding that question, it is at least clear that he is bound to follow the authoritative interpretation of his statute as found by the courts.
[22]
In his letter of July 18, 1986, the Registrar cited the decision of Cattanach, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). In that case the Registrar accepted an amendment from prior to proposed use and his decision was appealed by the opponent. The case implied that there were grounds for the Registrar's decision but the matter was not finally dealt with as the appeal had been brought against the wrong party - the Registrar should have been named as respondent. The case was brought on again in the form of a s. 18 application in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There, Cattanach, J., dealt more fully with the legality of the Registrar's decision. I find his language very appropriate:
"The contention on behalf of the applicant herein is that, predicated upon s. 37(b) of the Regulations, an amendment after advertisement of an application alleging a date of prior use to one based upon proposed use is of necessity a change in the date of first use.
"The sound rule of construction is to give the same meaning to the same words occurring in different sections of a statute or regulations made thereunder.
"The words used in s. 37(b) of the Regulations are 'change a date of first use'.
"Those same words are used in s. 36(c).
"Provisions is thereby made that no amendment may be made at any time:
... to change a date of first use ... of the trademark to an earlier date ...
"By virtue of s. 36(d) no amendment may be made at any time:
... to change the application from one not alleging use (which must of necessity mean an application based on proposed use) ... the trademark in Canada before the filing ... to one alleging such use ... (that is to one alleging prior use).
"Applying the contention on behalf of the applicant herein to the language of s. (d) that the change of an application based on proposed use to one based upon use would of necessity result in a change in the date of first use to an earlier date. In an application based on proposed use the use would follow the filing of the application but in an application based on prior use the trademark has been used prior to the application. That reasoning is tantamount to saying that s. 36(d) by changing proposed use to prior use is to the same effect as changing the date of first use.
"If that be so there would be no necessity for s. 36(c) which precludes a change in the date of first use because if that were so that circumstance would be covered by s. 36(d).
"Prima facie different language in different paragraphs in the same section must be interpreted as indicating a different meaning and a different subject matter.
"Thus, in my view, s. 36(d) is limited to a change in the application from one based on proposed use to one of prior use.
"Section 36(c) is limited to a change in the date of first use to an earlier date.
"Thus s. 37(b) because of the use of the same words therein as in s. 36(c), 'to change a date of first use', is likewise limited to that subject matter and does not extend to an amendment to change the applications originally based on prior use to applications based on proposed use.
"Such an amendment is not the subject of a specific regulation prohibiting such a change.
"That being so the amendment here in question falls within the broad concept of s. 35 and may be made at any time either before or after advertisement.
"Thus it follows that the amendments presently made are at the instigation of the applicant for registration and there is no discretion in the Registrar to refuse them.
"Accordingly the application for the relief sought by the applicant herein is denied."
[23]
Even if I were to disagree with this reasoning, and I do not, it certainly binds the Registrar and directs him to take the position that an amendment from prior use to proposed use is permissible. His earlier decision properly confirmed that a change to a later first date could not be made. He subsequently concluded that this decision may have unjustly deprived the applicant of his right to change from prior to proposed use. There was nothing to prevent him from attempting to redress this injustice so long as he treated all parties fairly, which he did.
[24]
For these reasons the application is dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.
