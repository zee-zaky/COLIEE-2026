Muldoon, J.
: This litigation evinces a sudden-growth thicket of motions and counter-motions between the parties and one, Debbie (Deborah) Kostyshyn (Johnson), the beneficiary of the adjudicator's award, and a collateral-proceedings applicant herein as well as in suit no. T-607-92. In that case the adjudicator's award was filed as a judgment of this court.
[2]
The present proceedings were commenced on February 28, 1992, by the applicant's originating notice of motion in which it seeks:
"... an order quashing, setting aside and declaring invalid the decision of Adjudicator Booth being an adjudicator appointed pursuant to the provisions of the
Canada Labour Code
which decision bears date January 15, 1992, and was received by the applicant on February 3, 1992.
"This application is made pursuant to s. 18.1(1) of the
Federal Court Act
on the following grounds:
1. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction in making the award he did.
2. The award of the adjudicator is patently unreasonable.
3. The adjudicator erred in law in failing to give effect to the provisions of the employment manual which specified that the complainant was entitled to two weeks notice of termination.
4. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding an allowance for extra income tax as specified in paragraph 7 of the award.
5. The adjudicator erred in law in awarding an allowance for extra income tax as specified in paragraph 7 of the award.
6. The adjudicator erred in law in awarding an allowance for extra income tax as specified in paragraph 7 of the award rather than directing that the monetary portion of the award be paid over the period for which compensation was ordered in bi-weekly instalments as such compensation would in the ordinary course have been received.
7. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in awarding compensation for the period February 1, 1991 to November 1, 1993 as such compensation is excessive and patently unreasonable having regard to the age, position and years of service of the complainant.
8. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in requiring the applicant to pay compensation during the period of time during which the complainant will be on maternity leave.
9. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in awarding costs on the basis as set forth in paragraph 5 of the award.
10. The rules of natural justice have been breached in that the applicant has a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the adjudicator.
11. The rules of natural justice have been breached in that the adjudicator refused to hear evidence with respect to the issue of reinstatement.
12. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in determining that reinstatement was not possible.
13. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in making the award of compensation for any period of time beyond the date of the award having regard to the fact that the complainant refused to consider reinstatement.
14. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in making the award of $3,000 as set forth in paragraph 6 of the award.
15. The adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law in placing upon s. 242 of the
Canada Labour Code
a patently unreasonable interpretation.
16. Such further and other grounds as the court may be advised."
The originating notice goes on to indicate that the application will be supported by the affidavit of Mark Newman together with the exhibits filed at the adjudication. Finally, the applicant requests that the adjudicator send to this court's registry and to the applicant a copy of all exhibits filed at the adjudication held before him.
[3]
The above mentioned originating motion sparked a sharp response from Kostyshyn (Johnson) (hereinafter Johnson), who launched two applications:
1. for leave to intervene; and
2. for (a) an order striking out Mark Newman's affidavit, sworn February 26, 1992, and (b) an order striking out the originating notice of motion of February 28, 1992; inter alia.
[4]
In regard to the first motion on Johnson's part, happily the applicant, by counsel, consents to it and the court has the jurisdiction so to order. Happily, because ordinarily jurisdiction cannot be conferred or acquired merely by consent or convenience. The respondents are not both represented by counsel. The Minister appeared by counsel, but not the adjudicator, although duly served. Their interests are not diminished by the according of leave to intervene sought by Johnson.
[5]
Such a focus is particularly necessary where, as here, the federal tribunal's jurisdiction is attacked. If the tribunal will not defend its jurisdiction, Johnson must be permitted to intervene, and that would be so, even if the tribunal - the adjudicator - were to defend his jurisdiction. The adjudicator is a person whom the Minister entrusted to perform an inter partes adjudication, and it is difficult to understand why the Department of Justice seeks to avoid the provision of counsel, an expense which the adjudicator alone should not have to bear, in order to defend jurisdiction. Johnson alone is perhaps left to do that. Johnson seeks to intervene to defend her interests. Johnson surely has an interest in the outcome and could be seriously affected by it. She will probably present a different point of view from that of the adjudicator, and indeed, the only response if the adjudicator does not respond. She is permitted to be an intervenor herein, as if she were a party with all the rights and responsibilities of a party, including the right of appeal, and/or response to another party's appeal, if any. The style of cause shall be amended accordingly. This disposition deals with the first of Johnson's applications, but it does not dispose of the issue of compliance with rule 1602(3) which came into force on February 1, 1992.
[6]
Now, in her rôle of intervenor, with the virtually plenary standing it affords, Johnson, by counsel, prosecutes her two-pronged second preliminary application. Prong (a) is for the striking-out of Mark Newman's affidavit. The affidavit runs to some 10 paragraphs. Counsel for the intervenor made certain points of attack comprehending one or more paragraphs in Mark Newman's affidavit. Counsel for the applicant West Region Tribal counsel, who is that very same Mark Newman, responded in the same way to the intervenor Johnson's attacks.
[7]
The intervenor's counsel's first complaint is that the affidavit, being that of counsel, is not admissible to support the West Bank Tribal Council's application to quash the adjudicator's decision and award. There is some jurisprudence which confirms that complaint and sustains it:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 8 F.T.R. 107 (T.D.). However, the applicant's counsel/deponent indicates that his firm is obtaining the services of an outside counsel. Such counsel will be needed, he says, because in his affidavit he deposes to matters to which he is the sole eye-or ear-witness, and therefore, counsel says, he cannot avoid being a deponent. That remains to be seen, in the circumstances of this case. However, the applicant's counsel avers, when and if the substance of his client's application be brought on for hearing, another counsel will appear for the applicant. That conceivably could cure the problem, at least apparently insofar as Mr. Newman was a personal witness of fact. At first blush, however, it was not wrong for the intervenor to make the objection articulated by her counsel in this regard until the undertaking to engage other counsel was expressed to the court. However, at the material times Mr. Newman was, and still is the solicitor and counsel of record.
[8]
The respondent levies other complaints against Mr. Newman's affidavit. sworn February 26, and filed February 28, 1992. It is not clear why the recent amendments to the
Federal Court Act
and
Rules
should have caused any deviation from good practice in regard to this principal supporting affidavit.
[9]
If that matter of the lawyer's affidavit can be resolved, then the respondent's counsel's first further point of contention relates to the content of paragraphs 3, 8, 9 and 10 of the supporting affidavit sworn by the applicant's counsel. They run thus:
"3. Exhibits 'F' and 'G' [copies of actuarial reports dated Nov. 8 and December 10, 1991, filed at the adjudication] were supplemented by the oral evidence of Douglas Poapst. Poapst gave evidence as to the lost income which the complainant would suffer based on an assumption that she would have spent the rest of her working life as an employee of the applicant. This evidence was used as the foundation for the argument made by the complainant that she should receive as compensation an amount in the range of $310,000 to $321,000 as per Exhibit 29 which amount should be discounted to take into account various contingencies including voluntary retirement of the complainant from the workforce, the employer going out of business and the complainant becoming wholly or partially disabled. The adjudicator was asked to award $100,000 on the basis that this represented the lifetime earning disability which the complainant would suffer discounted to take into account certain additional contingencies. This was the sole conceptual basis upon which the complainant based this portion of her claim. The complainant argued that the common law test utilized in wrongful dismissal cases was to be ignored and that the complainant was to be compensated based on the present value of her lifetime earnings less amounts she might potentially earn from lower paying jobs she might obtain over the rest of her working life which was assumed to be till age 65.
. . . . .
"8. One of the remedies sought by the complainant initially was reinstatement. Prior to the hearing the complainant took the position that she did not wish to be reinstated and during the course of the hearing she reconfirmed this position. John MacDonald, a director of the applicant, gave evidence at the hearing and indicated that reinstatement would be considered. In cross-examination he was asked if the Chiefs who make up the Board of Directors of the applicant were prepared to meet with the complainant to discuss reinstatement and he indicated they were. A meeting was arranged for December 11, 1991 which was to be attended by the complainant who wished to meet with the Chiefs to discuss reinstatement. The meeting of December 11, 1991 was a special meeting arranged on short notice with no guarantee that all of the Chiefs would be present. In fact 5 of 8 Chiefs were present but the complainant took the position that absent all Chiefs being present, she would not meet.
"9. On December 19, 1991 the solicitor for the complainant wrote to the adjudicator asking him to proceed with his award and advising that reinstatement was no longer possible. On January 6, 1992, I wrote to the adjudicator asking that he reconvene the hearing to hear further evidence from the parties as to why reinstatement was no longer possible, a decision which the applicant felt was a unilateral decision on the part of the complainant. Attached as Exhibit 'T' is a copy of the letter of January 6, 1992, directed to the adjudicator. The applicant in argument took the position that the complainant was not entitled to damages beyond the date of the hearing if she was not prepared to be reinstated. It was the position of the applicant that the complainant by taking the position that she had to meet with
all
Chiefs before she would consider reinstatement, and by refusing to meet with the five Chiefs who were available, created a set of preconditions to reinstatement that were unreasonable and which she was not entitled to create. The complainant then unilaterally advised the adjudicator that reinstatement was not possible and the adjudicator heard no evidence from the parties as to the events which caused the complainant to refuse to consider reinstatement. The adjudicator in his reasons on page 2 stated that he was left with the impression at the conclusion of the hearing on December 11, 1991 that reinstatement was not feasible. This is not accurate as in fact it was still contemplated at this date that a meeting might occur.
"10. Exhibit 'D' is a copy of the policy manual which on page 5, paragraph 7 provides:
'
Termination Of Employment
'Any employee resigning from his/her position of employment within the W.R.T.C. Inc. shall give a written two (2) week notice of termination. Any employee being terminated will be given two (2) weeks notice.
'Failure to provide sufficient notice will result in the employee forfeiting two (2) weeks salary.
'If employee fails to provide sufficient notice, the employer shall provide two-weeks pay.'
"The complainant in cross-examination agreed that she was familiar with the policy manual and indicated that in quitting her employment in August of 1989 to take another job she gave two weeks notice because that is what the policy manual required. In response to questions from the adjudicator the complainant indicated that she was aware that other employees terminated without cause had received two weeks notice and in cross-examination confirmed that she was aware that she was in accordance with the provisions of the manual entitled to two weeks notice upon termination by the employer."
[10]
The respondent's counsel asserts that the allegations made in the above-cited paragraphs have no place in this court. He states that in paragraphs 3, 8, 9 and 10 counsel for the applicant wants to relate to this court what evidence that deponent perceived to have been adduced before the adjudicator and his interpretation of it, or the interpretation he would like to put on the evidence and arguments presented to the adjudicator. If such a deposition would not be legitimate for a spectator at the adjudication, why should counsel be permitted to make such deposition?
[11]
Judicial review, says the intervenor's counsel, is confined to a record which has a narrowly defined base, generally: the initiating document, the award and the adjudicator's reasons if given with and as a part of the award. (At this point, consideration of the import of the
Canada Labour Code's
ss. 243(1) and (2) is deferred for a later passage in these reasons.) The applicant's principal and essential complaint is about the quantum of the award, the applicant having admitted that the intervenor was unjustly dismissed from her employment. Since that award's quantum is not shown to be so shocking or egregiously wrong, it is not judicially reviewable. After all, these proceedings are not, and cannot be, an appeal on the record, going classically to "law, evidence and the weight of evidence". Here, an error of law and an error of fact finding must be such as to exceed the tribunal's jurisdiction.
[12]
If the adjudicator committed an error of law, it must be shown that he applied such a wrong legal text as to have made an award which Parliament has never intended be made. That clearly is not the case here. Indeed, even in an appeal on the record, far short of which judicial review amounts in microscopic analysis, the appellate court or tribunal is bound not to disturb an award of damages which it, itself, would not have made - so long as such award be not grossly aberrant. This is not an appeal on the record, to repeat the obvious, for which Parliament made no provision, but rather a discretionary judicial review upon application to be supported by affidavits.
[13]
Paragraph 3 of the solicitor's impugned affidavit purports to summarize the intervenor's (i.e. complainant's) arguments to the adjudicator. Whether parts of paragraph 3 might be salvaged if recombined and differently expressed, matters not. It is simply irrelevant and improper on an application for judicial review. Is this unthinkable? The jurisprudence is mixed in result, some decisions leaving the sorting-out of impugned supporting affidavits to the judge who will adjudicate the application, such as
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (an interlocutory matter in which much of the mixed jurisprudence is cited) (appeal, A-610-84, dismissed with costs January 10, 1985), and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (an originating application in which the affidavit was wholly struck out, citing supporting jurisprudence, with leave to file a new affidavit) (appeal, A-926-90, abandoned Nov. 13, 1991). Paragraph 3 will be struck.
[14]
That must be the fate, also, of paragraphs 8 and 9, earlier above recited. Again, the applicant seems to be wanting an appeal on the record, rather than judicial review. The adjudicator's decision is appended as Exhibit "A" to the impugned affidavit. Paragraphs 8 and 9 appear to be less than candid, when compared with the adjudicator's very findings expressed on pp. 2 and 3 of his decision:
"Some efforts were made to explore the matter of reinstatement at the hearing of December 9, 1991, which evidently did not bear fruit, and I was left with the conclusion at the close of evidence December 11, 1991, that reinstatement was not feasible.
"The evidence (summarized) which brought me to that conclusion was:
"Chief McDonald stated in direct examination 'we would now consider reinstatement'.
"He stated on cross-examination that he 'thinks' they could now work with her but reinstatement would have to be discussed with the Board.
"There was some indication the Board may be prepared to meet with her to allow assessment of reinstatement.
"There was no more evidence from the employer about reinstatement December 9, 1991 or December 11, 1991, and therefore after evidence was completed December 11, 1991, and argument commenced, I was not too receptive to argument on that point.
"During the course of the hearing I had invited evidence on the reason for dismissal and explanation of the possibility of reinstatement. I heard no evidence that satisfied me.
"Nevertheless, when I received a request December 19, 1991, from Ms. Lamb to allow Mr. Newman to make a further submission on reinstatement, I allowed it, despite Mr. Schulman's objections.
"Further written submissions were made by both parties and on January 14, 1992, I heard further arguments on the point of reinstatement and also costs.
"I find no lack of sincerity on Chief McDonald's part but his qualified evidence that 'reinstatement would be considered' was extended by said further submissions only to the point where I concluded there was some willingness to reinstate.
"I find this falls short of satisfactory bona fide evidence of reinstatement or that it would be feasible, even after said submissions."
[15]
The adjudicator adjudicated properly in regard to the evidence and arguments presented to him. Paragraphs 8 and 9 thresh old straw without demonstrating any error to be the subject of judicial review. In seeking to obtain a second hearing on the matter of reinstatement and in presenting apparently new evidence and in seeking to reargue by referring to the arguments put to the adjudicator the said paragraphs evince compositional, internal impropriety, but no error on the adjudicator's part. They too warrant being struck out, for they raise no jurisdictional error. Indeed, the adjudicator's said written decision demonstrates that he heeded the representations made to him on December 16, 1991 and January 6, 1992 set out in Exhibits "H" and "I" to the impugned affidavit. Paragraphs 8 and 9 shall be struck out.
[16]
Paragraph 10 of lawyer Mark Newman's affidavit refers to his Exhibit "D", a 28-page copy of the Western Region Tribal Council Incorporated Administrative Policy Manual -Amended by W.R.T.C. Board of Directors October 3, 1990. Paragraph 10 recites three paragraphs drawn from the "Termination of Employment" provisions of the policy manual (para. 7, p. 5). The version exhibited has the first of those three paragraphs scribbled over, as if to delete it, but without any explanation for such scribbling. The rest of lawyer Newman's paragraph 10 consists of his commentary on or reconstruction of what Johnson said in cross-examination and in answer to the adjudicator's questions about her conduct and knowledge concerning the recited passage of the exhibited policy manual. To what purpose is lawyer Newman's recitation of selected testimony by Johnson, even if his recitation be accurately reconstructed? The adjudicator dealt with those considerations unexceptionably at pp. 6 to 8 of his written adjudication decision. There is, objectively, nothing patently unreasonable about the adjudicator's treatment of the subject, and nothing patently unreasonable is alleged about the grounds in paragraph 3 of the applicant's notice of motion, which is confined to alleging error in law. Nor, indeed, did the applicant's counsel, the same Mr. Newman, allege, orally or in writing, that the adjudicator's consideration and conclusions on the termination-of-employment provisions of the manual were patently unreasonable.
[17]
It is true that paragraph 2 of the stated grounds in the applicant's notice of motion alleges that "the award of the adjudicator is patently unreasonable", but unless that allegation be patently demonstrable, and it is not, it is mere verbal filler and nothing more. If there be anything at all unreasonable about the adjudicator's award, which is not to suggest that there is, such unreasonableness is far, far from being "patent", meaning manifest or apparent to everybody as in the expression: "... hereby make these letters patent", patent being there an adjective. In the above considered expression, "patently" is the adverb.
[18]
All this is to say that paragraph 10 of Mr. Newman's affidavit does not demonstrate any crossing of the very high threshold test of "patently unreasonable", and in failing to do so it remains merely improper and vexatious. Paragraph 10 of Mr. Newman's affidavit shall be struck, and would deserve that fate even if it were not the applicant's counsel's deposition in support of the motion. Counsel argues that it (and paragraphs 3, 8 and 9) "are not intended in any way to deal with the merit of the decision the adjudicator made but rather to show that the adjudicator made an error of law and/or exceeded his jurisdiction in coming to the conclusions he did as disclosed by his decision". Paragraph 10, and the others, utterly fail to demonstrate any excess of jurisdiction, and, if they show an error of law, which is not to say they do show such, it must be in the circumstances, and is, very far from being such an egregious error as to render the proceedings or the award "patently unreasonable".
[19]
In addition to paragraphs 3, 8, 9 and 10 of counsel's affidavit filed in support of the applicant's motion which are not properly available or admissible to establish what occurred at the hearing, there are other paragraphs to be considered. Apart from being part of a forbidden solicitor's affidavit, paragraphs 1 and 2 are innocuous, except that paragraph 1 clearly identifies the deponent as a member of the applicant's solicitors firm. Paragraph 2 lists the documents exhibited and appended to the impugned affidavit. Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7, and Exhibit "H", do attack jurisdiction, not as it was firmly established at the time of the adjudicator's appointment and the opening of the hearing but, the applicant alleges, as he subsequently lost jurisdiction by what amounts to alleged misconduct on his part indicating bias against the applicant.
[20]
This is the point at which to consider the privative provision emplaced in s. 243 of the
Canada Labour Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 (hereinafter, sometimes the
Code
). Remembering that the adjudicator in this case was appointed by the Minister pursuant to s. 242 of the
Code
, the succeeding provision runs as follows:
"243(1) Every order of an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) is
final, and shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court
.
"243(2) No order shall be made, process entered or proceeding taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain an adjudicator in any proceedings of the adjudicator under s. 242." (Emphasis not in text)
It may be wondered why the court did not dismiss out of hand the applicant W.R.T.C.'s motion to quash the adjudicator's decision.
[21]
Parliament accords to this adjudicator and all adjudicators, the jurisdiction prescribed in the
Code's
s. 242(4), the W.R.T.C. having admitted unjust dismissal of Johnson. It runs:
"242(4) Where an adjudicator decides pursuant to subsection (3) that a person has been unjustly dismissed, the adjudicator may, by order, require the employer who dismissed the person to
(a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person;
(b) reinstate the person in his employ; and
(c) do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal."
If the adjudicator fairly and without proved bias, or proved apprehension of bias, operates within the four corners of s. 242, and especially s. 242(4), the adjudicator is complying with the will of Parliament and pursuant also to Parliament's will, s. 243 of the
Code
exacts that the adjudicator, despite any garden-variety or other errors of procedure, fact and law, short of patent unreasonableness, shall not be disturbed or reviewed.
[22]
The court presumes to transcend the protective provisions of s. 243 only if it be demonstrated that the adjudicator has so patently unreasonably stepped outside of the jurisdiction which Parliament conferred that the adjudicator can be clearly perceived to have perverted, evaded, avoided or contradicted the will of Parliament. After all, the High Court of Parliament can hardly be convened for such matters which are the ordinary grist for the adjudicatory mills of the superior courts. Parliament's protection of the adjudicators' process awards and decisions is simply intended to cover a multitude of adjudicators' "sins" so long as the result be not patently unreasonable.
[23]
The above propositions are trite law as the jurisprudence discloses:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Cartwright, J., for the majority at p. 502:
"The effect of this section, if it receives the construction most favourable to the appellant, is to oust the jurisdiction of the superior courts to interfere with any decision of the Board which is made in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the legislature; within the ambit of those powers it may err in fact or in law; but I cannot take the section to mean that if the Board purports to make an order which, on the true construction of the
Act
, it has no jurisdiction to make the person affected thereby is left without a remedy."
Services Employees' International Union, Local 333 v. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Association
, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 382; 41 D.L.R.(3d) 6, per Dickson, J., for the court, at pp. 385-386 S.C.R.:
"The following sections of the
Trade Union Act
[Sask.] are also relevant:
. . . . .
'21. There is no appeal from an order or decision of the board ... and its proceedings, orders and decisions shall not be reviewable by any court of law or by an certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, injunction or other proceeding whatever;'"
and at pp. 388-391:
"... There can be no doubt that a statutory tribunal cannot, with impunity, ignore the requisites of its constituent statute and decide questions any way it sees fit. If it does so, it acts beyond the ambit of its powers, fails to discharge its public duty and departs from legally permissible conduct. Judicial intervention is then not only permissible but requisite in the public interest. But if the Board acts in good faith and its decision can be rationally supported on a construction which the relevant legislation may reasonably be considered to bear, then the court will not intervene.
. . . . .
"Reference must be made to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In that case the Union sought certification as bargaining agent of all employees at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in its building division at Ottawa, with certain exceptions. The company opposed the application on the ground that the constitution of the Union could only be interpreted as excluding from membership in the Union those persons claimed by the Union for certification. The Board rejected the company's submission and applied a policy of its own making in dealing with the question whether an employee was a member of a Union.
. . . . .
"[In that
Metropolitan Life
case] the Board failed to deal with the question remitted to it and instead decided a question not remitted to it. The recent judgment of the House of Lords in the
Anisminic
case, supra, as well as the judgment of this court in
Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], were relied upon. It would seem to me that in the case at bar the circumstances are very different. In the instant case, the Board dealt with the question remitted to it, viz., whether the Association was a trade union, as defined. That question in turn required determination of the further question whether the Association was a company dominated organization, as defined. The Board gave its answer to both of these questions.
. . . . .
"... The reasons for decision of the [Saskatchewan] Board do not state the number of persons employed by S.R.N.A. and the Board did not expressly find that S.R.N.A. was an employer or employer's agent but I do not regard this as fatal to the Board's jurisdiction. A tribunal is not required to make an explicit written finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion. The role of the court in a case such as this is supervisory, not appellate: s. 21 of the
Act
."
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 237; 51 A.P.R. 237; 97 D.L.R.(3d) 417; 79 C.C.L.C. 14,209, per Dickson, J., having kept in mind the statute's private provision, at p. 237:
"Put another way, was the Board's interpretation so
patently unreasonable
that construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review?" (Emphasis not in original text)
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , per Laskin, C.J., for the court at p. 719 S.C.R.:
"I do not see in these passages [from the above cited
Nipawin
case] any basis for questioning the jurisdiction exercised in the present case by the Canada Labour Relations Board. Essentially, this court has admonished that there must be no failure of natural justice (and there was none here) and that the Board should address itself to an issue arising under the legislation which it is charged to administer. If it has done this (as the Federal Court of Appeal held and, in my opinion, rightly so) there can be no jurisdictional infirmity when the Board is protected in its determinations by a privative clause. It may be wrong in law in interpreting the range of powers confided to it but its decisions are nonetheless immunized from judicial review."
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 437; 89 C.C.L.C. 14,050; [1989] 6 W.W.R. 673; 40 Admin. L.R. 181, reveals three judgments for each "pair" of the six judges who adjudicated, with La Forest, J., and Dickson, C.J.C., having the slightly variant concurrence of Sopinka and Lamer, JJ. Here is a crucial passage written by La Forest, J., at pp. 1003-1004 S.C.R.:
"Where, as here, an administrative tribunal is protected by a privative clause, this court has indicated that it will only review the decision of the Board only if that Board has either made an error in interpreting the provisions conferring jurisdiction on it, or has exceeded its jurisdiction by making a
patently unreasonable error
of law in the performance of its function; see
Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp.
, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 277. The tribunal has the right to make errors, even serious ones, provided it does not act in a manner 'so patently unreasonable that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review' (p. 237). The test for review is a 'severe test'; see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 493. This restricted scope of review requires the courts to adopt a posture of deference to the decisions of the tribunal. Curial deference is more than just a fiction courts resort to when they are in agreement with the decisions of the tribunal. Mere disagreement with the result arrived at by the tribunal does not make that result 'patently unreasonable'. The courts must be careful to focus their inquiry on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal, and not on their agreement with it. The emphasis should be not so much on what result the tribunal has arrived at, but on how the tribunal arrived at that result. Privative clauses, such as those contained in ss. 31 to 34 of the
Code
, are permissible exercises of legislative authority and, to the extent that they restrict the scope of curial review within their constitutional jurisdiction, the court should respect that limitation and defer to the Board." (Emphasis not in original txt)
Here is the slightly variant, but "important respect" in which Sopinka, J., differs from his colleague, at pp. 1017-1018 S.C.C.:
"While I agree generally with La Forest, J., on the principles underlying the scope and standard of review of labour board decisions, I cannot agree that it is always necessary for the reviewing court to ignore its own view of the merits of the decision under review. Any adjudication upon the reasonableness of a decision must involve an evaluation of the merits. Reasonableness is not a quality that exists in isolation. When a court says that a decision under review is 'reasonable' or 'patently unreasonable' it is making a statement about the logical relationship between the grounds of the decision and premises thought by the court to be true. Without the reference point of an opinion (if not a conclusion) on the merits, such a relative statement cannot be made.
"I share La Forest, J.'s, opinion of the importance of curial deference in the review of specialist tribunals' decisions. But, in my view, curial deference does not enter the picture until the court finds itself in disagreement with the tribunal. Only then is it necessary to consider whether the error (so found) is within or outside the boundaries of reasonableness. The test is, as La Forest, J., points out, citing
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a 'severe test'. But even here an appreciation of the merits is not irrelevant. Lamer, J., speaking for himself and McIntyre, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , stated at pp. 494-495:
'... though all errors do not lead to unreasonable findings, every unreasonable finding results from an error (whether of law, fact, or a combination of the two), which is unreasonable.'
"So long as the court is satisfied with the correctness of the tribunals' decision, any reference to reasonableness is superfluous."
and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , presents a six to one split decision, with Sopinka, J., for the majority, being reported thus at pp. 629-630 S.C.R.:
"In determining whether there has been a
simple error
in interpreting a provision conferring or limiting jurisdiction,
as in determining
whether jurisdiction has been exceeded by a
patently unreasonable error
, a pragmatic, functional approach must be adopted. [Emphasis not in original text.] This emerges from the following statement of Beetz, J., in
Bibeault
[[1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048] (at pp. 1088-1089):
'
At this stage, the court examines not only the wording of the enactment conferring jurisdiction on the administrative tribunal, but the purpose of the statute creating the tribunal, the reason for its existence, the area of expertise of its members and the nature of the problem before the tribunal.
At this initial stage a pragmatic or functional analysis is just as suited to a case in which an error is alleged in the interpretation of a provision limiting the administrative tribunal's jurisdiction: in a case where a patently unreasonable error is alleged on a question within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, as in a case where simple error is alleged regarding a provision limiting that jurisdiction, the first step involves determining the tribunal's jurisdiction.' [Emphasis added]
. . . . .
"Adopting a pragmatic and functional approach to the construction of these provisions, I have come to the conclusion that Parliament did not intend to confer jurisdiction on the Board with respect to the labour relations of employees who are not members of the Public Service. The Board by an error of law has assumed jurisdiction that it was not intended to have. Its decision is, therefore, reviewable."
Mr. Justice Sopinka, for the majority explained quite clearly why they did not defer to the decision of the P.S.S.R.B. in that
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  definition of the word 'employee' provided by s. 2, is practically decisive in this case. Section 33 is intended to enable the Board to resolve any question as to whether an employee or class of employees is or is not included in a bargaining unit. In the absence of a definition of 'employee', it could be argued that the Board could determine who is an employee on the basis of tests that are generally employed in labour matters. These tests are customarily employed to resolve a dispute as to whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. The express definition of 'employee', however, shows a clear intention by Parliament that it has decided the category of employee over which the Board is to have jurisdiction. It is restricted to persons employed in the Public Service and who are not covered by the
Canada Labour Code
. The Board's function by the very words of s. 33 is not to determine who is an employee but rather whether employees who come within the definition provided, are included in a particular bargaining unit."
However one looks at the P.S.S.R.B.'s conduct in this <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, it is patently obvious that the P.S.S.R.B. blundered outside of the jurisdiction which Parliament intended by enactment to confer on that board.
[24]
Keeping in mind the adjudicator's statutory jurisdiction conferred by s. 242(4) of the
Code
, that is, to order the employer who unjustly dismissed a person, to (a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person; and ... (c) do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract
any
consequence of the dismissal, the court here finds no reason to go behind the privative provisions of ss. 243(1) and (2) of the
Code
. Indeed the court may even stretch its compass here into that "extra-statutory" reference to reasonableness by stating that the adjudicator's order is neither inherently, nor shown to be, "patently unreasonable" in the circumstances. Therefore, even if one were to accept the solicitor's affidavit, one simply could not, to this point of consideration, circumvent the privative clauses expressed in ss. 243(1) and (2) of the
Code
.
[25]
There is yet another ground upon which the W.R.T.C. seeks to have the adjudicator's order quashed; and this ground could be so serious, if established, as to bring down the adjudicator's order. The ground is that of bias, manifested as racial prejudice, alleged on the part of the adjudicator. If proved as actual bias at the time of the adjudication, or if objective, reasonable apprehension of bias be proved, such would ipso facto atomize the adjudicator's jurisdiction. No one could acquiesce in the proposition that Parliament would have intended that such a defective adjudicator would exercise adjudicatory jurisdiction over and between the parties, much less that his or her jurisdiction should be cosseted by a statutory privative clause.
[26]
As noted by Mr. Justice Sopinka in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  decision under review. In the case at bar, the applicant's counsel indicated at the hearing of this matter that the whole of his evidence for the W.R.T.C. is expressed in his impugned affidavit. On that basis, this court can properly, according to Sopinka, J., and Lamer, now C.J.C., and easily form its own view of the merits of the decision under review in the light of the allegations of the adjudicator's possible "predisposition against natives which may have caused him prefer the complainant [Johnson] over the applicant [W.R.T.C.]", as alleged in paragraph 7 of the impugned affidavit sworn by the W.R.T.C.'s counsel.
[27]
Attached to counsel's said affidavit is Exhibit "H", a copy of a letter which he wrote and addressed to the adjudicator on December 16, 1991. The passage which could relate, distantly, to an allegation of some "predisposition against" the W.R.T.C., even although no such allegation is specifically levied against the adjudicator therein, is on page 3 and it runs thus:
"I wish to make one other comment in respect to two comments which you made during the course of the hearing. The comments which you made are as follows:
'1. At one point during the hearing you suggested that perhaps Mrs. Johnson had been terminated because she was nonnative and a decision had been made by West Region Tribal Council that they would not employ nonnative individuals;
'2. During the course of argument, when it was suggested to you that an application could have been made to the Dauphin Friendship Centre, you indicated that this would be going from "the frying pan to the fire".'
"I wish to express my concern to you that you seem to have an impression that the termination of Mrs. Johnson was somehow motivated by concerns related to racial origin. You were told at the hearing that this was not the case and that you should not think this. Nonetheless, you seem to be of the view that she should not be expected to apply for a job at the Dauphin Friendship Centre. I expressedmby concern to you that your conclusion in this regard is inappropriate having regard to the evidence you have heard and that any impression you may have gained that Mrs. Johnson was terminated for racial reasons is entirely inappropriate." (Exhibit "H" to Mark Newman's affidavit)
[28]
Yes, it is true that "concerns related to racial origin" and termination of employment "for racial reasons" are specified in that passage. That passage however boldly tells the adjudicator that he has apparently misconstrued the evidence adduced before him, or that he seems to have formed a view not supportable by such evidence. The writer, Mr. Newman, does not levy any accusation or reproach of bias in the nature of racial prejudice. No such bias can be inferred in these circumstances according to the usual judicial standards for finding such bias.
[29]
The only evidence of such bias as is alleged, is that expressed in the lawyer's affidavit which runs as follows:
"4. During the course of the hearing the adjudicator made certain comments which caused me concern and as a result I wrote to the adjudicator on December 16, 1991, a copy of which letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 'H' expressing my concern with respect to the comments. The comments made were as follows:
'(a) as cause was not in issue no evidence was placed before the adjudicator as to the circumstances of the termination. The adjudicator at one point during the course of the hearing speculated that the complainant had been terminated because she was a nonnative who was employed by a native organization which organization had determined that it would not employ nonnative individuals;
'(b) during cross-examination, on the issue of mitigation of damages when it was suggested that the complainant ought to have applied for certain jobs which were available at the Dauphin Friendship Centre, a social agency which services a native clientele, the adjudicator stated that this would be going from "the frying pan to the fire".'
"5. At the conclusion of the argument on January 14, 1992 the adjudicator stated to me as I was departing the adjudicator's office, 'I take it it must be difficult getting instructions from your clients'.
"6. During the course of the hearing I was advised by Louise Lamb, a member of Fillmore & Riley, and the solicitor who had conduct of this matter until mid-November of 1991, that subsequent to the appointment of Adjudicator Booth, and following her appearance before him on a preliminary matter, Adjudicator Booth assisted her in carrying some documents on an unrelated matter to her vehicle when they observed an individual who appeared to be a native Canadian, and was obviously intoxicated, at which point the adjudicator asked Ms. Lamb whether the individual was one of her clients." (Mark Newman's affidavit)
[30]
Counsel for the W.R.T.C., the affiant of the above quoted affidavit passage, recognized that paragraph 6 constitutes the grossest hearsay, which is, in fact a breach of rule 332(1); and of like rules of the other superior courts in Canada. He indicated that his associate, Louise Lamb, could and would swear to her own affidavit. That affidavit would be subject to the same disabilities as is counsel's own affidavit, since Ms. Lamb was also the W.R.T.C.'s counsel before the adjudicator, as Mr. Newman averred, and she is his associate in their law firm. Even if Ms. Lamb's allegation could be properly proved to be true, does it evince prejudice or sympathy with the much publicized plight of some aboriginal persons in Manitoba?
[31]
Do the allegations in the lawyer's affidavit, if true, show bias or a reasonable apprehension of bias? No. The first allegation is found in paragraph 4(a). In light of other evidence before the adjudicator, the alleged speculation would likely occur to any intelligent, shrewd and sensitive person. Given the current climate of lofty support for the "first nations" campaign for the racial segregation of peoples inherent in aboriginal self-government, the speculation would come as easily as it might in other instances of an employer being a Celtic Literacy Society, Sons of Erin, Club La Verendrye, Ukrainian National Home or any other employer distinguished by racial or ethnic purposes. Given the W.R.T.U.'s admission of wrongful dismissal, the adjudicator may have simply been enquiring if there would be other evidence which would bear on the award. Even if such were not the adjudicator's intent, and remembering that this affidavit, even if true, is not properly before the court, the allegation in paragraph 4(a) does not taint the adjudicator's jurisdiction. Many persons in Canada who are not of the aboriginal peoples are nevertheless natives because they were born in Canada. That the adjudicator knew that the West Region Tribal Council was established by and for aboriginal people of whom Johnson is apparently not one, would not even require great perspicacity on his part. That goes utterly no distance toward establishing any prejudice either against them or against her. That complaint is a nonentity.
[32]
Paragraph 4(b) alleged facts which may be related to those of the preceding complaint. No one here has asserted that aboriginal organizations are legally or morally bound to hire Euro-Canadians or bound not to give preference in hiring to Aborigino-Canadians. As with the Celtic, Francophone or Slavic organizations earlier above mentioned there could be required for employment an appropriate justifiable language skill. If that were so, an injudicious observation, but not a mark of prejudice, on the adjudicator's part would be going from one such position (if it were so) where Johnson was wrongfully or unjustly dismissed, to another such position, or even seeking such a position would be like "going from the frying pan into the fire". Perhaps the adjudicator ought never to have said that, if he did, but it does not condemn him of prejudice, nor strip him of jurisdiction.
[33]
Several passages from the adjudicator's decision provide an insight into counsel's complaints:
"This matter was the subject of preliminary motions on September 6, November 19 and December 4, 1991, in Winnipeg, and the hearing which went on December 9, 1991, in Dauphin, and continued December 11, 1991, in Winnipeg.
. . . . .
"At the motion on December 4, 1991, Mr. Newman agreed on behalf of the employer that there was an unjust dismissal and that the complainant would proceed with her evidence first, and that the issues would be the amount of compensation and the question of mitigation.
"Mr. Newman further agreed that if he had any particulars of a specific refusal to mitigate, he would provide notice of same prior to the hearing. He did not do so but reserved the right to argue lack of effort to mitigate in general and indeed, cross-examined and argued vigorously on this point.
. . . . .
"[The adjudicator cited a body of jurisprudence on mitigation, and then continued.]
. . . . .
"While there were some jobs (notably the Dauphin Friendship Centre) which she did not apply for, I find that her decision not to apply for the job because it was an 'unstable' organization and cited an ability to speak Cree or Saulteaux as an asset, to be a rational decision. ..."
From the foregoing no scintilla of prejudice is evident.
[34]
The adjudicator's oral remark expressed to counsel and reported in paragraph 5 of that lawyer's affidavit about getting instructions from the lawyer's client, is given utterly without context and again amounts to no condemnation of prejudice. Nor does it create any reasonable apprehension of prejudice. Indeed, if true, it could equally be construed as a mark of sympathy with counsel's situation. As to paragraph 5, Johnson's counsel argued orally as follows:
"... Now let me make an allegation. This isn't evidence. I might be able to satisfy your Lordship that it was very difficult for Mr. Newman to get instructions throughout the case. Perhaps I can establish it, perhaps I can't. But when I go to cross-examine Mr. Newman on paragraph five, I intend to explore fully and properly whether or not he was able to get timely instructions from his client, and if so, perhaps I'll go on to ask why I wasn't provided certain information on times where I felt that I was entitled to it. The point is that my cross-examination of Mr. Newman is bound to get into the area normally covered by solicitor-client privilege ..." (Transcript: p. 21)
Counsel referred then to the
Lex Tex
case, earlier above cited. Objectively, paragraph 5 evinces a frivolous complaint of bias.
[35]
A good standard by which any such matter of alleged bias or prejudice against a party to proceedings may be judged is that formulated by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in
Committee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 394-395 S.C.R. For himself, Martland and Judson, JJ., de Grandpré, J., adopted and ratified the norm expressed by the Federal Court of Appeal, which, shorn of all else mentioned by the learned judge boils down to this essence: "what would an
informed
person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude?" (Emphasis not in original text.) By that standard, it is easy to hold that there is now shown to be even any reasonable apprehension of bias on the adjudicator's part. Of course, it would be quite otherwise if the adjudicator were shown to be a supporter of those who denigrate and mock non-Euro-Canadians as noted recently in this court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  were shown to be unsympathetic toward or even antipathetic toward aboriginal persons as human beings, on a racist basis, or a basis of alleged racial superiority. Here no prima facie case is demonstrated of bias or even a reasonable apprehension thereof. No denial of natural justice has been shown. The applicant's effort in this regard is simply futile.
[36]
There is yet another ground upon which the applicant's attempt to strip the adjudicator of jurisdiction is also rendered futile. There is a nonspecific, but common-sense, limitation upon allegations of bias or prejudice because they are easy to levy after the event, but not so easy to prove - and the taint of such allegations may be impossible to avoid, even if the prejudice be not proved. Therefore, in jurisprudence the law requires prompt complaint. The counsel for the W.R.T.C. cited
Re Rosenfeld and College of Physicians & Surgeons
(1970), 11 D.L.R.(3d) 148 (Ont. H.C.), where a differently constituted committee recommended a penalty. It had no jurisdiction, so, the order imposing that penalty was a nullity, despite counsel's "not suggesting that they were not qualified to sit". That jurisprudence is distinguishable from the case at bar. A tribunal without jurisdiction ab initio will inevitably produce futility and nullity ab initio, but where it is alleged that the tribunal, as constituted, wielded undoubted jurisdiction, but then lost it through misconduct such as evincing prejudice, the complaint of prejudice is to be made promptly in order to be credible.
[37]
A nullity ab initio can be perceived and declared almost at any later time for it never was of any effect, and demonstrably so. However when one alleges a denial of natural justice by means of alleged prejudice, one should - nay, must - so allege promptly, for effluxion of time can render such allegation not objectively demonstrable at all. The allegation of prejudice should not be secretly harboured, but made public immediately, thereby hoping to catch the tribunal "red handed", so to speak, in its prejudice and misconduct. So it is that the posture of waiting to discover whether one wins the contention before the adjudicator, prepared to make no allegation of prejudice if one does win, and complaining of alleged prejudice as a means of trying to avoid a confirmed loss, is abusive and to be discouraged.
[38]
It is stated in Kavanagh
A Guide to Judicial Review
(2nd [and last] Ed. 1984], Carswell, c. 3 "Bias and Delegation of Function", at p. 49:
"(j)
Waiver of Objection to Bias
"By failing to raise an objection concerning bias during the tribunal proceedings, the right to complain of it may be waived on judicial review. [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Sask.)] Bias only makes proceedings voidable, not void. It is not entirely clear under what circumstances a statutory disqualification, not merely declarative of a common law disqualification, may be waived. [de Smith,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(4th Ed.), pp. 275-276]"
[39]
In the work by Jones and de Villars,
Principles of Administrative Law
, 1985, Carswell, c. 13, "Prerogative Remedies", in compartment 7(a), contains a short study of acquiescence, on p. 373. It runs, in part:
"Acquiescence or implied waiver may occur when no objection is made to the tribunal's jurisdiction although the defect was apparent. Where there is a breach of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness, continued participation in the proceedings may deprive the applicant of his right to a prerogative remedy. For example, the court may refuse relief where the applicant raises an allegation of bias after the proceedings have gone against him, but knew of all the facts relating to bias before or at the time of the hearing."
The authors thereupon cite a considerable volume of jurisprudence in support of the above recited passage.
[40]
Following Mr. Justice Sopinka's notion cited earlier above, that the court really cannot - and should not - avoid forming some view of the merits, and concluding that not even a scintilla of reasonable apprehension of bias resides in the worst the W.R.T.C.'s lawyers can offer, the court will not accept their complaint as formulated no matter who swears to it and no matter who acts as the W.R.T.C.'s counsel in this matter. The complaints against the investigator are trivial and the intervenor Johnson ought not to be put to the trouble and the expense of responding further to them in order to maintain her judgment.
[41]
This matter stands in this posture. There is no basis whatever for holding that the adjudicator's decision is patently unreasonable. There is no good reason shown here to subvert or circumvent the privative provision which Parliament enacted in s. 243 of the
Canada Labour Code
. No bias, prejudice or denial of natural justice is, or could be shown on the proposed evidence brought before the court in the impugned affidavit of the W.R.T.C.'s counsel. The proposed evidence is trivial, if not abusive. Finally the affidavit of the applicant's counsel, Mark Newman, sworn February 26, 1992 and filed February 28, 1992, must be struck out; and in substantive particular the court finds that its paragraphs 3 through 10 are improper in the circumstances and they must be struck out irrespective of other considerations. The affidavit shall be struck out.
[42]
Because the W.R.T.C.'s application for an order "quashing, setting aside and declaring invalid the decision of Adjudicator Booth" is supported by no other affidavit than the impugned and now-struck affidavit of Mark Newman, it cannot stand. The court listened carefully to both principal counsels, carefully perused their subsequent written submissions and the doctrine and jurisprudence cited, and the court has deliberated several months now on this case. In view of the considerations expressed in these reasons, there appears to be no good reason to extend the time to permit the W.R.T.C.'s counsel to obtain new affidavits. Without a finding of patent unreasonableness in the adjudicator's award, and no jurisdiction-dissolving bias, prejudice or other denial of natural justice, and in view of Parliament's clear and persistent intent expressed in s. 243 of the
Canada Labour Code
, the court must really dismiss the W.R.T.C.'s attack upon the adjudicator's decision. The circumstances expressed and considered herein provide an ample basis for such an exercise of discretion.
[43]
The intervenor's motion is granted in terms of striking out Mark Newman's affidavit and in terms of a negative disposition of the W.R.T.C.'s attack on the adjudicator's decision. That application of the West Region Tribunal Council is dismissed. The West Region Tribal Council is to pay Johnson's party and party costs of these proceedings (two counsel).
[44]
Nothing was alleged against the Minister of Labour by the W.R.T.C. His appointment of Derek Booth to be an adjudicator was never impugned. Counsel for the Minister asked, therefore, that the Minister of Labour be excused from being a respondent in these proceedings and counsel furthermore graciously declined costs. So be it. The order which reifies these reasons shall have a style of cause with the intervenor Johnson and without the Minister of Labour.
Order accordingly.
