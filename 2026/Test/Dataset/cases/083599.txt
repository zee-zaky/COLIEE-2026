McNair, J.
: This is an appeal of the defendant and plaintiff by counterclaim, Senstar Corporation, from the decision of the Associate Senior Prothonotary made on July 13, 1988, wherein he struck paragraphs 20, 22(d) and 22(e) of the defendant's amended statement of defence and counterclaim under rule 419 of the Federal Court Rules on the ground that the allegations pleaded therein did not disclose a reasonable cause of action within the meaning of s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act. The grounds of appeal are that the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in fact by sustaining the plaintiff's motion to strike, particularly with respect to the following:
(a) erred in fact and in law in finding that the pleading of the defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) failed to disclose a cause of action;
(b) erred in finding that the requirements for pleading damages under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act are different from those under any other section of the Trade Marks Act;
(c) erred in fact in finding that the defendant had failed to plead general damages when such damages were in fact specifically pleaded in paragraph 20;
(d) erred in law in finding, on an application to strike a pleading under rule 419, that there must be "proof of facts from which it can be concluded that damage 'surely' resulted" if the pleading is to be maintained.
[2]
The plaintiff sued the defendant for patent infringement and claimed the usual relief consequent thereon. The statement of claim was filed on July 31, 1984. The defendant filed an amended statement of defence and counterclaim on or about January 31, 1986. In addition to defending the claim of patent infringement, the defendant counterclaimed for injury to its reputation and business and damages therefor, including punitive damages. Paragraph 20 of the defence and counterclaim pleads as follows:
"20. The plaintiff has willfully and unlawfully informed customers and potential customers of the defendant, including departments of the United States armed forces, that the plaintiff is the owner of the patent and of certain technology rights associated therewith, that the defendant infringes the patent, and that the plaintiff intends to or has instituted an infringement action against the defendant under the patent, thereby damaging the reputation and business of the defendant."
[3]
The claims for general damages and punitive damages are set out in subparagraphs (d) and (e) of paragraph 22 of the statement of claim.
[4]
Paragraph 20 of the counterclaim identifies departments of the United States armed forces as customers or potential customers of the defendant. Paragraph 5 of the defendant's reply to the plaintiff's demand for particulars, lists twelve additional potential customers of the defendant to whom false or misleading statements were made by the plaintiff, as alleged in paragraph 20 of the counterclaim.
[5]
By court order dated December 20, 1984, any questions as to the extent of the infringement of any right and the damages flowing therefrom and the profits arising in respect thereof were made the subject of a reference after trial. Pretrial conferences were held on May 12 and June 13, 1988. Fourteen days of trial were allotted for the action, tentatively scheduled to commence in January, 1989. During the course of examination for discovery of the parties, little or no evidence was adduced with respect to the issue of damages by reason of the reference order aforementioned.
[6]
The case must be approached from the standpoint of determining whether the learned prothonotary was clearly wrong in law or on the facts in striking paragraphs 20, 22(d) and 22(e) of the defendant's defence and counterclaim on the ground that they failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action within the ambit of s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act.
[7]
The underlying rationale of the prothonotary's decision is thus explained in his reasons:
"As a result of the thorough review by counsel, I have concluded that 'resulting damage' referred to by Martland, J., in S. & S. requires at least proof of facts from which it can be concluded that damage 'surely' resulted.
"For such facts to be proved, there must be some allegation in the pleadings to which the necessary facts can be related, be it an allegation of a general loss of business as was sufficient  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or some specific person or persons to whom the alleged false or misleading statements were communicated, which it was indicated would be sufficient in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . There were no such allegations in the pleading before me. In addition, I note that plaintiff's counsel stated that on discovery, no person who had withheld business as a result of the communication was mentioned. This was not denied and I, therefore, did not request that the transcript for discovery be placed in evidence."
[8]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Martland, J., said at pp. 424-425:
"The combined effect of ss. 7(a) and 52 [now s. 53] of the Trade Marks Act is to create a statutory cause of action for which damages may be awarded if a person is damaged by false or misleading statements by a competitor tending to discredit the claimant's business, wares or services. The essential elements of such an action are:
1. A false or misleading statement;
2. Tending to discredit the business, wares or services of a competitor; and
3. Resulting damage.
"There is no express requirement that the false or misleading statements be made with knowledge of their falsity, or that they be made maliciously.
. . . . .
"In my opinion, the natural meaning of s. 7(a) is to give a cause of action, in the specified circumstances, in respect of statements which are, in fact, false, and the presence or absence of malice would only have relevance in relation to the assessment of damages."
[9]
Counsel for the defendant submits that the learned prothonotary clearly erred in law in making the decision to strike by failing to apply or even consider the justificatory standard that it was plain and obvious beyond doubt that the defendant's cause of action under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act was devoid of merit. She strongly urges that the prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle and fundamentally misunderstood the pleading in determining that there was a failure to prove facts from which it could be concluded that damage "surely" resulted. She contends forcibly that the prothonotary's finding that there were no allegations in the pleading as to general loss of business or the identification of the persons to whom the false or misleading statements were allegedly made constituted a patent error by reason that the pleadings did both. Defendant's counsel also stresses the general rule against striking a pleading where the other party has pleaded over to it or where, as in the present case, there has been a delay of almost four years in bringing on the motion to strike.
[10]
Counsel for the plaintiff makes the initial point that an appeal from a prothonotary is not a hearing de novo on the merits, but rather is an appeal in which the appellant has the burden of establishing on balance of probability that the order appealed from was clearly wrong in law or on the facts. He argues that the prothonotary's determination that there were no material facts to support the general allegation of loss of business and reputation should not be disturbed. He contends that a cause of action for loss of business is only sustainable in cases where there has been a general broadcasting of the false or misleading statements complained of, and says this is what the prothonotary was really addressing. Plaintiff's counsel further submits that ss. 7(a) and 53 of the Trade Marks Act, read together and in context, clearly create a statutory cause of action for which only special damages can be awarded. In his submission, the reference in S. & S. Industries, supra, to "resulting damage" must be taken to allude to "special damages".
[11]
I will begin by saying that I do not accept this last mentioned submission. In my view, there is nothing in s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act that categorically characterizes the damage resulting from disparaging statements in the nature of a trade libel as special damages, which must be particularly quantified and specially pleaded. As Spence, J., observed in S. & S. Industries, supra, in actions based on s. 7 of the Trade Marks Act, the complainant "... need only prove the action of which he complains and the damage which he incurred as a result thereof".
[12]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), Bowen, L.J., in discussing the damage done by a trade libel, said at p. 529:
"If, indeed, over and above this general damage, further particular damage is under the circumstances to be relied on by the plaintiff, such particular damage must of course be alleged and shewn. But a loss of general custom, flowing directly and in the ordinary course of things from a libel, may be alleged and proved generally. 'It is not special damage' -- says Pollock, C.B., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), a case much relied on by defendant's counsel, Urie, J., dealt with the pleading of general damages at p. 268:
"... there is no requirement in the General Rules and Orders of this court, so far as I am aware, requiring the amount of general damages to be stated in the pleadings. That being so, the principle relating to general relief is not limited by the failure to disclose the quantum of damages sought.
. . . . .
"So far as the quantum is concerned, it must be remembered that the damages here are general damages. As such they are presumed to be the direct, natural or probable consequence of the act complained of."
[14]
As previously indicated, the case of S. & S. Industries held that "resulting damage" was an essential element of the statutory cause of action for trade libel under ss. 7(a) and 53 of the Trade Marks Act. Section 7(a) reads as follows:
"7. No person shall
(a) make a false or misleading statement tending to discredit the business, wares or services of a competitor;"
[15]
Admittedly, the pleading technique employed in paragraph 20 of the defendant's counterclaim leans to the general rather than the particular in linking the alleged false statements to the damage likely to result therefrom. The concluding words "thereby damaging the reputation and business of the defendant" are amply sufficient, as it seems to me, to raise an allegation of general loss of business which, when coupled with the identification of the twelve additional customers in the reply to the demand for particulars, should have sufficed to dispel the prothonotary's concern about the insufficiency of the pleadings. The learned prothonotary seems to have fallen into the error of confusing what must be proven at trial to justify an award of damages for trade libel with what must be pleaded to raise a case of general loss of business as a legitimate cause of action under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act. The claim is one for general relief and the rule is clear that the amount of general damages alleged to flow from the act complained of need not be specially pleaded and quantified.
[16]
I agree with the submission of counsel for the defendant that the learned prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle in striking the defendant's counterclaim on the ground that it failed to prove facts from which it could be concluded that damage "surely" resulted. Sufficiency of pleading is one thing, proof at trial of the material facts so pleaded is another. I am also of the view that the learned prothonotary completely misapprehended the facts regarding the sufficiency of the allegations of general damages for loss of business and reputation and the naming of the customers of the defendant to whom the false or misleading statements were made.
[17]
In my view, this is sufficient to dispose of the present appeal and it is unnecessary to deal with the other specific grounds of error. I am fully satisfied that the defendant has sufficiently pleaded its case for trade libel under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act.
[18]
I would make only one further comment. Although not stated, it seems apparent on the facts that the motion to strike fell to be determined under rule 419(1)(a) by reason of the plaintiff having pleaded over and its long delay in launching the motion. Actually, the delay of some four years in bringing on the motion to strike smacks of being downright cavalier, if not oppressive. In any event, a pleading will only be struck on summary motion under rule 419(1)(a) where it is plain and obvious beyond doubt that the case raised by the pleading is incapable of success. Moreover, a pleading should not be struck where the other party has pleaded over or where there has been a lengthy delay between delivery of the pleading and the bringing of the motion to strike.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 1; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 417 (F.C.A.).
[19]
For the foregoing reasons the defendant's motion of appeal is allowed, with costs here and below in any event of the cause. An order will go accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
