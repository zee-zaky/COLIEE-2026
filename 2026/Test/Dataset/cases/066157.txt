: "I don't think necessity is the mother of invention - invention in my opinion, arises directly from idleness, possibly also from laziness. To save oneself trouble." Agatha Christie,
An Autobiography
[1977]
This case arises because one day a mechanically inclined farmer decided that the existing methods of wrapping silage grass were too difficult, inefficient, and time consuming. In order to save himself a great deal of trouble, he created a machine that he could use in his fields to make his life easier. The farmer patented the machine and licensed it to be sold. This invention was so useful that one Canadian farmer began reproducing the machine himself. This action was brought by the plaintiffs on October 6, 1992 for infringement of Canadian letters patent no. 1,285,862 that was granted on July 9, 1991 to that original farmer/inventor, David W. Anderson. There are two licensees under the patent: Grays of Fetterangus (1972) Ltd. (hereinafter "Grays") and New Perth Agritech Inc. (hereinafter "Agritech"). Grays manufactures the machines and Agritech sells them in Canada.
[2]
The defendant, Les Machineries Yvon Beaudoin Inc. (hereinafter "Beaudoin Inc.",) admits the infringement but defends the action on the ground that the patent is invalid.
Background Facts
[3]
Mr. Anderson is a Scottish inventor and farmer who holds Patent #1,285,862 as of July 9, 1991 for a tubeline balewrapper. The Canadian patent application was filed January 8, 1988. The machine embodied by the patent wraps multiple bales of silage grass in a plastic tube. The following is a graphic representation of the plaintiff's tubeline balewrapper.
[See printed version]
[4]
The defendant is a Quebec corporation that manufactures and distributes tubeline balewrappers. M. Yvon Beaudoin is the company's President. Prior to the entrance of tubeline balewrappers on the scene, the defendant sold single balewrappers. In August of 1990 and on three other occasions, M. Beaudoin saw the Grays tubeline balewrapper. Prior to M. Beaudoin seeing the Grays machine he had never seen a balewrapper that wrapped multiple bales in plastic.
[5]
M. Beaudoin had never designed a balewrapper before seeing the Grays machine, although he had made modifications to balewrappers before. In August 1990 Beaudoin Inc. began building a tubeline balewrapper. Over the course of time, the company produced and sold three models of tubeline balewrappers. The first Beaudoin tubeline balewrapper was sold in April 1991. That machine had the same number of rollers and the same angle of the roller bed as the Grays machine. Beaudoin admits that he copied the angle of the roller bed from the Grays machine. In April 1992 Beaudoin produced the second model of their tubeline balewrapper, and in January 1993, the third model. At the outset of the trial, the defendant conceded that all the tubeline balewrappers manufactured by the defendant carry out the same operation as the Grays tubeline balewrapper, and that if the patent is valid, the patent has been infringed by all the models of its machine.
Issue
[6]
There is only one issue to be determined: Is Patent #1,285,862 valid in terms of anticipation or obviousness, in light of certain prior art patents?
Claim In Suit
[7]
Claim 1 of the patent in suit is alleged to be infringed and is reproduced below.
"A bale wrapping machine comprising a wheeled base frame having a bale-receiving cradle followed by a bale wrapping device and a roller bed sloping down to ground level, the bale-receiving cradle comprising a support along which a bale can be translated into the bale-wrapping device and a hydraulic ram device for translating the bale along the support, the bale-wrapping device being located at a gap between the support and the roller bed and comprising a hoop arrangement through which bales can be translated by the hydraulic ram device, the hoop arrangement including a fixed hoop, a rotary hoop rotatable coaxially with the fixed hoop, a real for plastics strip carried by the rotary hoop and drive means for the rotary hoop."
The Witnesses
[8]
The parties introduced three expert witnesses who testified with respect to all the questions under consideration. These witnesses were helpful to the court in determining the application of the legal tests.
1. Mr. David W. Anderson, one of the plaintiffs in this action and the inventor of the patented invention, testified to the process through which the invention was created. Mr. Anderson is a Scottish farmer and a hobby mechanic. He explained to the court the trouble faced by farmers in 1985 in the making of silage, and described how he overcame those problems with his invention. Moreover, he described the prior art from an agricultural point of view.
2. Mr. John Tofts testified for the plaintiffs in rebuttal to the defendant's allegation of the invalidity of the patent. He is an English farmer who was employed as a packaging engineer until 1968. He gave expert testimony concerning the characteristics of the tubeline balewrapper, the degree of inventiveness necessary to arrive at such a device, the prior art (specifically the U.S. patents), and the knowledge and character of the notional person skilled in the art. Mr. Tofts was an excellent witness, and provided clear and useful information that was helpful to the court.
3. Mr. Jack Morantz gave expert evidence for the defendant. He is a practicing engineer from Montreal specializing in packaging. Mr. Morantz offered his expert opinion on the obviousness of the patented invention, the prior art, the essential elements of the patent in suit, and the knowledge and character of the notional person skilled in the art.
Construction Of The Patent
[9]
A patent must be construed by the court before the issues of validity and infringement are examined. While I have been provided with expert testimony concerning the patent in suit, it is for the court to construe the patent. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 348 (F.C.A.), at p. 351.) Construction of a patent involves deciding what elements of a patent are potentially protected by the patent monopoly granted by Parliament. In the case before me, the meaning of the words used in the patent claims are clear. Thus, my sole duty is to indicate the essential elements, or "pith and marrow", of the invention. (What is essential to an invention is a question of construction.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 203; 56 C.P.R.(2d) 145, is useful to remember:
"There is no occasion for being too astute or technical in the matter of objections to either title or specifications for as Duff, C.J.C., said, giving the judgment of the court in
Western Electric Company Inc. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reasonable view of it, can be so read as to afford the inventor protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented, the court, as a rule, will endeavour to give effect to that construction'. Sir George Jessel spoke to effect at a much earlier date in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  really useful invention'."
Nevertheless, the construction of a patent is to be approached dispassionately and without regard to the effect of the construction on the issues in suit. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), at p. 43.)
[10]
The central principle of patent construction is that a patent is addressed, not to the public, but to persons skilled in the art of the patent under review. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 161 (F.C.A.).) Madame Justice Reed set out the principles relating to the construction of patents in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.):
"(1) in construing a patent one must adopt a purposive construction and not engage in an overclose parsing of the words;
"(2) the question that must always be asked is whether the 'pith and marrow', or the substance of the plaintiff's invention has been taken;
"(3) if a variant of an aspect of the claim has no material effect on the way the invention works there is a presumption that the patent is infringed and that the patentee intended that that variant falls within the scope of the claim;
"(4) the question that always must be asked, however, is whether the patentee intended to include or exclude equivalents (variants) from the scope of the invention claimed;
"(5) The patentee's intention in this regard is not his actual intention, if that could in any event be ascertained with any degree of certainty, but it is the intention of the patentee as expressed in the text of the patent, read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, specifically the knowledge of those skilled in the art."
[11]
Applying these principles, I am of the view that the invention outlined in claim 1 of the patent refers to a machine that wraps bales of grass or hay in a continuous row. This device has a cradle for receiving a bale near its mouth, and a support along its axis. A hydraulic ram at the cradle pushes the bale over a gap in the support and through a rotary mechanism. The rotary mechanism is made up of a rotary hoop driven by a motive force along a fixed hoop. A sloped bed of rollers leads from the rotary mechanism down to the ground. The parts of the machine are mounted on a frame that, in turn, rests on wheels.
[12]
The specification clarifies how a machine described by the patent claims operates. (
Airseal Controls Inc. v. M & I Heat Transfer Products Ltd.
(1993), 72 F.T.R. 196; 53 C.P.R.(3d) 259 (T.D.), at p. 262.) Examination of the specification aids the court in answering the questions: "What is your invention? How does it work?" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  grass to avoid contact with the air. Silage is a form of feed used to feed farm animals in the winter. If air touches the grass, the silage rots and is useless. A tubeline balewrapper prevents that rot from starting. A bale of grass or hay is loaded into the cradle by a tractor or bale spike. The hydraulic ram then operates to compress the bale against the next bale so that the flat ends of the bales are touching each other. As the bale is pushed into the rotary mechanism it is wrapped along its circumference. The gap in the frame supporting the bale allows the plastic to travel completely around the bale without wrapping the bale to the machine. As the bale exits the rotary mechanism it rides a sloped bed of rollers down to the ground, pushed by the bale behind it. The machine itself moves along the ground propelled by the friction of the line of wrapped bales against the rough ground. The continuously wrapped line of bales acts as an anchor against which the hydraulic ram pushes. The invention produces a long line of continuously wrapped bales.
[13]
The parties agreed on the construction of most of the elements of the patent specifications. They agree that the rotary wrapping mechanism is essential to the patent, along with the cradle and frame. They also concurred that the fixed hoop that supports the rotary mechanism was not essential to the invention. The parties disagree on the status of the wheels and bed of rollers. I took their submissions into account when construing the patent. The plaintiffs submit that it is the rollers slopping to the ground and the wheels that make the invention useful in the field. The defendant responds that the bed of rollers and wheels are not essential to the invention.
[14]
In my view, the wheels and sloped bed of rollers are part of the "pith and marrow" of the patented invention. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Tofts, from the points of view of the farmer and the farmer/engineer, both explained clearly to the court why the wheels are essential to a tubeline balewrapper. The wheels allow the machine to move during operation, and thus, place the wrapped bales on the ground where they need not be moved until the silage is needed to feed the animals. Similarly, the sloped bed of rollers allows the wrapped bales to be lowered to the ground while minimizing the chance of ripping the plastic. Mr. Morantz, from the point of view of a packaging engineer, confirmed under cross-examination that the wheels and bed of rollers were essential to the invention at pp. 63-64 of the transcript:
"A. Yes. Anything that I omitted in the description would have been because it -- Yes, I omitted the nut and bolts.
Q. But you left in what affects how the invention works.
A. What I thought to be the essential elements, yes.
Q. With the additional essential elements we just described, that is slopes down to the ground and that it allows movement over the ground during operation.
A. The machine does in fact slope down to the ground, yes.
Q. And it does allow movement during operation.
A. The machine does in fact have wheels.
Q. And both those are essential, otherwise you're going to either damage the plastic if it doesn't move or, if they don't slope down to the ground, it will drop down and damage the plastic as well.
A. Yes.
Q. Thank you."
[15]
Thus, all the experts agreed that regardless of whether the notional person skilled in the art is a member of the agricultural, packaging or both industries, the invention includes wheels and a sloping bed of rollers.
Validity Of The Patent
[16]
In the present case, only two grounds of invalidity have been raised: anticipation and obviousness. Section 47 of the
Patent Act
[see footnote 1] and the jurisprudence provide a presumption of the prima facie validity of a registered patent. Under the statutory presumption, the party attacking the patent has the onus of proving that the patent is invalid, no matter what the ground of attack. In the case before me, the question is whether the defendant has proven on the standard of balance of probabilities that the patent in suit is invalid as having been anticipated or as being obvious.
Anticipation
[17]
The statutory provision relevant to the issue of anticipation is found in s. 27 of the
Patent Act
which states:
"(1) Subject to this section, any inventor or legal representative of an inventor of an invention that was
(a) not known or used by any other person before he invented it,
(b) not described in any patent or in any publication printed in Canada or in any other country more than two years before presentation of the petition hereunder mentioned, and
(c) not in public use or on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to his application in Canada,
may, on presentation to the Commissioner of a petition setting out the facts, in this Act termed the filing of the application, and on compliance with all other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to him an exclusive property in the invention."
[18]
The defence of anticipation assumes that invention has been disclosed to the general public prior to the application for the patent. In deciding the question of anticipation, the courts consider a single document in the way it would be read and understood by a person skilled in the art at the time of the filing of patent. That single prior publication must describe completely the invention. In the words of Hugessen, J.A., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A), at p. 297:
"One must, in effect, be able to look at a prior, single publication and find in it all the information which, for practical purposes is needed to produce the claimed invention without the exercise of any inventive skill. The prior publication must contain so clear a direction that a skilled person reasoning and following it would in every case and without possibility of error be led to the claimed invention."
[19]
The defendant's counsel argued that this test is too rigorous and that the court should look only at the elements of the invention essential for practical purposes, i.e. the "wrapping device" of the apparatus. In his submission it is only these elements that should be compared between the patent in suit and the prior publication. He admits, however, that if the court follows the applicable case law, none of the prior publications, taken individually, contain
all
of the essential elements of the apparatus. Specifically, only the patent in suit teaches the inclusion of wheels and a bed of rollers that slopes to the ground.
[20]
I have examined the prior publications adduced by the defendant, and more specifically the Lancaster device. Applying the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test, I find that none of the prior publications teach all of the subject matter necessary to produce the invention without the exercise of inventive skill, and none give clear and unmistakable directions which would lead a skilled person to the invention.
Obviousness
[21]
The test for obviousness in Canada has been summarized clearly by Hugessen, J.A., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He stated at p. 294:
"The test for obviousness is not to ask what competent inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy."
[22]
The difference between anticipation and obviousness has been described as follows: anticipation suggests that "your invention, though clever, was already known", while obviousness suggests that "any fool could have done that". (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 178 (F.C.A.), at p. 182.) The major difference in applying the tests for each is that anticipation requires an exact prior description in a single source, while obviousness can be based on everything from a single disclosure to a mosaic of the entire state of the art. (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  obviousness becomes: would an unimaginative skilled worker, not a competent inventor, have been led to the invention directly and without difficulty if he had all the information available at the date of the invention. This date (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (P.C.).), or when the apparatus was fabricated. In the case at bar, I accept the evidence of Mr. Anderson that he made his first sketch of the tubeline balewrapper in February or March 1986. Therefore, the date of the invention would be no later than the end of March 1986.
The Unimaginative Skilled Technician
[24]
One of the issues raised at trial by counsel was the identity of the skilled technician. Is he found in the agricultural or packaging industries? In my opinion, the notional person skilled in the art needs have some kind of experience or interest in the subject matter of the invention. As suggested in the
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.); cited in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at pp. 48-50.), he is the equivalent of the skilled addressee of the patent specification. In my opinion, in the present case, the skilled technician must have some knowledge of agriculture. The "packaging" technician would not know how to make silage. He would have no idea that air must be kept from the wrapped grass or else the silage will rot. Nor would he know that bales can be effectively wrapped end to end in long rows.
[25]
Mr. Tofts is a good approximation of the unimaginative skilled technician. While he is an inventive person, his other characteristics come close to those of the notional person in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test. He has both agricultural and engineering knowledge. A member since 1975 of the Institution of Agricultural Engineers, he is familiar with technical subjects related to agricultural engineering. He also has an interest in the packaging industry, having worked for many years (until 1968) in the design and development of wrapping machines. Equipped with that general knowledge of the agricultural and packaging fields, the mythical unimaginative skilled technician must look at all of the prior art, keeping in mind that the invention must be arrived at directly and without difficulty, and that he should be careful of any ex post facto analysis.
[26]
I am of the view that the unimaginative skilled technician described above would not have been able to develop a tubeline balewrapper. He would not have been able to arrive at the invention even in light of the existing state of the art, and, more particularly, the Lancaster device. The Good patent is not useful in the context of obviousness, and I will therefore not refer to it below.
The Lancaster Machine
[27]
The most credible witness, in my view, was Mr. Tofts. He answered directly and without hesitation, and his testimony was most informative to the court. His rebuttal evidence endeavoured to convince the court that an unimaginative skilled technician would not have arrived at the tubeline balewrapping device. Mr. Tofts thought the Anderson machine a "clever" invention:
"Even if I had thought of the idea of wrapping bales end to end I would not necessarily have designed the tube-lined bale wrapper of the Anderson patent. If I had managed to design the tubeline bale wrapper, not only would it have been clever of me to do so, but it would probably only have been after experimentation and testing of various combinations of other elements." (Affidavit of John Tofts, paragraph 36.)
[28]
During his testimony he elaborated upon why he thought the invention "clever" (Examination in Chief of John Tofts, pp. 53-55.):
"Q.	With reference to the points you've made in your affidavit, would you explain the following.
Even if you had thought of wrapping bales end to end, which you said you would not have but it would have been clever of you to do so, but on the premise that you had thought of it in 1986, would you explain your statement as to why you would have been clever to do so, and only after experimentation and testing of combinations of other elements would this have occurred.
A.	I've been packaging long enough to know that even the most simple tasks sometimes look very easy, but if you change the type of object you're wrapping it can become extremely difficult. If I'm allowed to, I can give you an example.
I could show you a machine to wrap one of those cassettes that's exactly the same thing as a taffy coated peanut bar, and you would think, 'Fair enough. I'll put them through the same machine, into the same material, and there will be no difficulties.'
But the great thing about the taffy coated peanut bar, it's full of sticky taffy and crumbs, it gums up the machine and can make the machine totally unsuitable for that particular purpose.
Q.	What about grass silage as it relates by analogy to that?
A.	Grass silage is a material, as I've shown you, which come in different size of bales, in shapes of bales. Depending on the moisture content with which it is harvested, whether it's a rainy day or a dry day, a windy day or a sunny day, you can get a bale which is round, and there's a fifth type of bale you can show on that diagram that's an oval bale. If they are sufficiently wet, they sag.
Not only that, it depends on the type of grass you're cutting and putting into it. Some of it is extremely stringy. I've had bales which have been, or have wrapped bales for people who had have grass or what we call marsh, you might call it swamp, which is extremely fine and spongy in a bale. Coupled with that, although they say you tie a bale, in actual fact you wrap it around a string and you invariably have two ties coming off it. These are adept at getting caught in various parts of machinery, especially rotating machinery.
It's for all these reasons that I know in my own experience in packaging that you'd have to do a deal of experimentation and deep thought or be jolly luck to come up with the right answer straight away.
And therefore I reckon that Mr. Anderson's machine was ingenious."
[29]
The defendant's expert witness, Mr. Morantz, submits that the prior art patents the defendant has relied upon (in particular the Lancaster device) teaches an apparatus and process for making unitary packages. In his affidavit, he affirmed that it did contain all the essential elements of the Canadian Patent 1,285,862. If put on wheels, its functionality would be the same as the Anderson machine. An unimaginative technician applying known packaging principles used in the past would have, without inventiveness, come directly to Mr. Anderson's solution.
[30]
However, in cross-examination Mr. Morantz admitted that the wheels were essential to the Anderson invention, and were not only for portability, but permitted the machine to move during operation. The machine's progress along the ground allowed the plastic-wrapped bales to be free of damage. (Transcript of Cross-examination of Jack Morantz, at pp. 61-64.) He also admitted that a bed of rollers sloped down to the ground was essential. The Lancaster apparatus has neither of these features.
[31]
There are three major differences between the Anderson and Lancaster patents. First, the Anderson patent teaches that the bales must be compressed against each other. If air is allowed to rest between the bales the silage grass will rot. The Lancaster device has a cutting mechanism attached to it that can only function when a space exists between the objects being wrapped. Mr. Morantz discussed the cutting device under cross-examination:
"Q. The U.S. Lancaster Patent doesn't teach anything about leaving the packages uncut. In fact it teaches the reverse. It teaches that they should be cut.
A. It doesn't teach that they should be cut. It describes the means by which they can be cut, yes.
Q. In all embodiments, every embodiment, it's described, illustrated or hinted they are cut, are they not?
A. That is correct. [Ibid, at p. 76.]
. . . . .
Q. But, in the Lancaster Patent, they are wrapped continuously but then they are cut.
A. That is correct.
Q. So the technician, knowing about the Lancaster Patent, would have the idea of wrapping continuously and then cut it. That's what he has in his mind.
A. Yes, understanding that, in the case of the Lancaster Patent, it is desirable to remove the unitary severed packages as discrete elements. [Ibid, at p. 135.]
. . . . .
Q. So all embodiments that are taught explicitly, sir, have a cutting mechanism.
A. Yes." [Ibid, at p. 33.]
[32]
Second, the Anderson machine uses an angled bed of rollers to transport the bales down to the ground. The Lancaster machine has a level powered conveyor belt that moves the wrapped product away from the wrapping mechanism. The product must then be lifted from the belt or it will fall to the floor. Allowing a wrapped bale to fall to the ground would damage the plastic wrapping and allow the silage to rot. In paragraph 38(c) of his affidavit, Mr. Tofts states:
"Lancaster does not teach a roller bed sloping down to ground level. One of the essential features of the tube-lined bale wrapper defined in Claim 1 is the bed of rollers that slopes down to the ground to allow a tube of wrapped bales to descend, moving from the bale wrapper to the ground. (The bale wrapping device must of course be raised off the ground to allow the plastic film to pass under the bales.) Obviously a horizontal bed of rollers would have to be unrealistically long to wrap a continuous row of bales. And if a row of bale simply dropped off the end of a horizontal roller bed, the plastic around the bales would be damaged. Lancaster does not contemplate a roller bed that slopes down to the ground so as to place a continuous row of wrapped objects onto the ground. On the contrary, Lancaster contemplates a cutting area where the wrapped loads are severed into individual packages which are then carried off to a stacking or processing section."
[33]
Third, the Lancaster apparatus is fixed to the floor, while the Anderson invention sits on wheels. The wheels allow portability and permits the machine to move while in operation. Mr. Tofts addressed this issue in direct examination by referring to his affidavit at paragraph 38:
"Q. b) Lancaster does not have a wheeled-base frame. One of the essential elements of the tube-lined bale wrapper defined in Claim 1 of the Anderson patent is that it is movable along the ground. If a tube-lined bale wrapper cannot move along the ground, it will not work. I can attest to this because I have attempted to wrap bales with my tube-lined bale wrapper when its wheels were stuck in soft and uneven ground, and I can assure you that a continuous line of bales cannot be wrapped in such circumstances.
Would you explain what you mean by 'a wheeled-base frame' as it relates to the Anderson claim and your statement that the Lancaster patent does not have a wheel-based frame. And you may refer to the figures in the Lancaster patent if it's convenient for you.
A. The Lancaster patent clearly shows machines with legs, standing presumably on a factory floor.
Q. Number 24, for example, in Exhibit P-5?
A.Yes, for example.
The Anderson machine has a chassis, a wheeled chassis, and it is part and parcel of the Anderson principle that the machine propels itself along the ground, and as such has to have a chassis which is strong enough, (a) to overcome the resistance of being pushed along the ground and, (b), carrying a great weight of articles on it, because on the Anderson machine you will see that there are at least six bales, maybe seven, and each of these bales weighing over half a ton you're talking about, in all that weight of about four and a half tons, five tons of machine being propelled along the ground.
In soft conditions, I might add, the machine does have problems, or can have problems of bogging down, as I've described." (Transcript of Examination in Chief of John Tofts, at p. 45.)
During cross-examination Mr. Morantz acknowledged that, unlike the Anderson machine, the Lancaster patent teaches that the components must be fixed to the floor. (Transcript of Cross-examination of Jack Morantz, at p. 38.)
[34]
Due to these differences, Mr. Tofts was of the view that it would have been clever of him to design the tubeline balewrapper. I accept his conclusion as being that of the unimaginative skilled technician. The invention would certainly not be obvious to an unimaginative skilled technician, and the evidence clearly points to the necessity of at least a scintilla of imagination. The defendant's expert witness himself concluded that a scintilla of inventiveness was necessary (Ibid, at pp. 118-119 and 138):
"Q. And you are not able, Mr. Morantz, to put yourself in the mind of this practised technician back in 1986 without knowing of the Anderson invention to say, 'Without difficulty he would have come up with the Anderson invention.'
A. What I am able to say is, if someone was presented with the Lantech invention and the basic requirement in wrapping bales of silage, I am able to say that someone with exposure in the packaging industry, with very limited inventiveness, would in fact have been able to come up with that solution.
Q. Therefore, to come up with the idea of dispensing with the synchronization of the in-feed with the take-away and doing away with the powered take-away is using, we will say, a scintilla of inventiveness. You said 'limited'. How about 'a scintilla' of inventiveness?
A. It is a difficult thing to quantify, but, okay."
[35]
In light of this conclusive evidence concerning inventiveness, it's not necessary to examine the commercial success of the invention.
Disposition Of The Action
[36]
Judgment is in favour of the plaintiffs. Therefore, there will be a declaration of validity and infringement of claim 1 of Canadian letters patent no. 1,285,862 and a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from further infringing the patent. Delivery up of the offending machines to the plaintiffs will be ordered. Moreover, I will exercise my discretion so that the plaintiffs may have damages or an accounting of profits, as they may elect.
[37]
There shall be a reference in accordance with my Order dated 26 January 1994. All with costs to the plaintiffs.
Judgment for plaintiffs.
