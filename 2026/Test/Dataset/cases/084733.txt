I.
Introduction
[1]
Shore, J.
: The Applicants seek a judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection Division  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated January 14, 2013, wherein, it was determined that neither Applicant was a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under section 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [
IRPA
].
II.
Background
[2]
The Applicants, Mr. Luis Fernando Bueso Trochez and Mr. Lesther Enrique Bueso Trochez, are brothers and citizens of Honduras. They were born and raised in the city of San Pedro Sula.
[3]
In 2001, the Applicants' parents immigrated illegally to the United States and left the brothers in the care of their grandmother.
[4]
The Applicants began attending the Centro Educativo en Computacion in February 2005.
[5]
The Applicants' Personal Information Form [PIF] then indicates:
a) In March 2005, the Applicant, Mr. Lesther Bueso, was approached by members of the Mara Salvatrucha 13 [MS-13] criminal gang outside their school and was badly beaten when he refused to join their gang;
b) In May 2005, the other Applicant, the younger brother of Lesther Bueso, Luis Bueso, faced a similar demand to join the gang and when he refused, he was beaten and stabbed in his upper left arm. This required a visit to the local hospital;
c) The Applicants' family attempted to file a complaint with the local police; however, without more information, the police advised them that they could not do anything;
d) The Applicants moved to an aunt's home in San Pedro Sula in June 2005, and then to their grandfather's home in the city of Comayagua in December 2005;
e) In February 2006, the Applicants decided to leave Honduras for the United States to live with their parents. They traveled through Guatemala and Mexico by car, and on March 16, 2006, successfully, crossed the Mexican-US border by foot at McAllen, Texas.
[6]
The Applicants reunited with their parents in Miami and remained in the United States without legal status for over 5 years.
[7]
The Applicants arrived in Canada on March 26, 2011 and claimed refugee protection a few days later.
[8]
The Applicants indicate that continuing threats made to their brother, German Bueso, have made them fearful to return to Honduras. They feel their family is targeted by the MS-13 gang because they refused to join their ranks in 2005.
III.
Decision under Review
[9]
The RPD rejected the Applicants' asylum claim on January 14, 2013.
[10]
At the outset, the RPD found that the Applicants had not established a nexus to a Convention ground. The Applicants had agreed with this determination in regard to the Convention at the oral hearing, itself, therefore, the RPD did not discuss the matter any further in its decision in regard to a Convention ground (Hearing Transcript at p 17).
[11]
Having concluded that a claim under section 96 had not been established, the RPD considered whether the criteria of section 97 of the
IRPA
had been satisfied. The RPD found that the Applicants' evidence was not credible; therefore, they had not established a personal risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment pursuant to section 97 of the
IRPA
.
[12]
The RPD raised the lack of specificity in respect of the Applicants' claim; they could not identify a single member of the gang that had been trying to recruit them, although they alleged they were well-known in their neighbourhood. The RPD also found that it was implausible for the MS-13 to continue to seek the Applicants years after they had left the country. Referring to the documentary evidence, the RPD noted that it did not find that the Applicants fit the profile of youths, recruited by the MS-13, or even that the MS-13's recruitment pattern was, generally, one of forced recruitment.
[13]
The RPD also drew a negative inference from a significant inconsistency between the PIF and the Applicants' testimony in regard to when they had left the school where they had been attacked. The Applicants indicated in their PIF that they had withdrawn from school in November 2005; however, at the hearing, the Applicants claimed they left school immediately after the attacks in the spring of 2005. The RPD noted that the date given at the hearing would have been included in their PIF narrative if the allegations had been true as "such actions provide proof of facing risk."
[14]
Given these credibility problems and a general lack of evidence corroborating their story, the RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the Applicants had not met their burden of establishing that their allegations of risk of torture were true.
[15]
In addition to this negative credibility finding, the RPD also found that the Applicants' alleged risk of torture was of a generalized nature, faced by a large number of young people in Honduras targeted by gangs, such as the MS-13. As the risk was of a generalized nature, not specifically targeting the Applicants, themselves; thus, even if they had been credible, the provision of section 97 would not apply to the Applicants. The RPD cited the cases of
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in support of this conclusion.
[16]
Correspondingly, the RPD concluded that the Applicants had not met the burden of establishing that the city of Comayagua was not a viable internal flight alternative [IFA].
IV.
Issues
[17]
(1) Is the RPD's credibility determination reasonable?
(2) Is the RPD's determination that the Applicants faced a generalized risk reasonable?
(3) Is the RPD's determination that there is an IFA available in Honduras reasonable?
V.

VI.
Position of the Parties
[19]
The Applicants submit that the RPD's credibility determination was not reasonable as it ignored and misconstrued key pieces of evidence; particularly related to RPD's findings on the MS-13's recruitment pattern and the Applicants' profiles.
[20]
The Applicants also submit that the RPD erred by giving too much weight to the inconsistency between their PIF and testimony with regard to the date they withdrew from school. The Applicants maintain that such an inconsistency cannot, in and of itself, support a negative credibility finding.
[21]
The Respondent submits that the Applicants did not demonstrate that the RPD's conclusion regarding the absence of credibility of the claim was unreasonable.
[22]
The Respondent first emphasizes that it was within the RPD's jurisdiction to use a common-sense approach in determining the credibility of the Applicants and to take into account any discrepancies in their claims (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). According to the Respondent, the RPD was equally entitled to reject explanations in respect of discrepancies as they were insufficient to give credence to their allegations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
The Respondent further contends that the RPD was open to draw a negative inference from the Applicants' failure to produce documentary evidence by which to corroborate their claims (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
Lastly, the Respondent affirms that it was also reasonable for the RPD to draw negative credibility findings in regard to the omissions and contradictions between the facts alleged in the Applicants' PIF and their testimony (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis)) at para 33;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
VI.
Analysis
Standard of Review
[25]
The applicable standard of review in respect to the weight of the evidence and as to findings of credibility is that of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4).
[26]
The applicable standard of review as for the second issue, determining whether an applicant faces a generalized risk, is also that of reasonableness as it is a question of mixed fact and law (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[27]
Lastly, the standard of review on a question of an IFA is also that of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
(1)
Is the RPD's credibility determination reasonable?
[28]
This Court has repeatedly confirmed that the accumulation of contradictions between an applicant's testimony, port of entry statements and Personal Information Form [PIF], as well as the omission of elements in the PIF, crucial to his or her claim, may legitimately serve as a basis for a negative credibility finding (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
These findings can also be based on common sense, implausibility and an inherent logic to an applicant's narrative ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). When such findings are made, they are dispositive of a claim; unless the record contains reliable and independent documentary evidence to rebut it (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
In the present case, the Court finds that the Applicants' narrative contains a number of important contradictions and implausibilities regarding the central allegations of their claim. The RPD, therefore, had reason to make a negative credibility finding. The negative inferences drawn by the RPD are not just based on "minor or trivial variations or omissions", but, rather, on the central elements of their claim (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[31]
In their PIF narrative, the Applicants' stated that they were "afraid to go back to school or even leave the house" after their attacks and moved to their aunt's home in another neighbourhood to seek safety in June 2005 (at para 14, 18); however, they indicated later in their PIF that they continued to attend the school where they were attacked (and persistently harassed) until November 2005. When asked about this contradiction at the oral hearing, the Applicants changed the dates, stating that they had, in fact, both withdrawn from school shortly subsequent to the attacks out of fear of the MS-13. The Applicants were not able to provide a reasonable explanation for this inconsistency between their PIF and their testimony.
[32]
In the Court's view, this contradiction seriously undermines their credibility as it is a key detail to their claim; it relates directly to their alleged fear of persecution by the MS-13. The fact that the Applicants would have continued attending school for 6 months, following the attacks, despite their persecutors forcibly recruiting members at that location, demonstrates a lack of subjective fear of the gang. It is, in the Court's opinion, sufficient to form the basis for an adverse finding on credibility.
[33]
The Applicants could not satisfactorily explain to the RPD why they were not able to identify a single member of the MS-13; although, they were allegedly well-known in the community. They also did not provide any objective evidence supporting their explanation as to why they were being targeted by the MS-13 or how the attacks took place (e.g. medical reports, police reports, etc.).
[34]
The only documentary evidence provided to the RPD as to the alleged attacks consisted of medical certificates issued by a Montreal medical clinic in 2009 that confirmed that both Applicants had suffered past injuries. The RPD gave this evidence little probative value as it had only recently been obtained and merely repeated a version of the facts that the RPD considered to be implausible; the certificates did not confirm the source of the Applicants' injuries. The RPD was entitled to find that this documentary evidence was insufficient to give credence to the Applicants' narrative; and, therefore, chose to give it little weight.
[35]
As stated by this Court on numerous occasions, general findings of lack of credibility can
affect all related evidence submitted by an applicant
, including documentary evidence, and ultimately cause the rejection of a claim (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
In their written representations, the Applicants mainly criticize the RPD for not having considered specific passages in the documentary evidence prior to contradicting their narratives (see documents in Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] at pp 132, 183). The Court cannot agree with the Applicants' view that the RPD erred in its decision by ignoring or misconstruing this evidence.
[37]
The Court is of the view that the RPD's findings were fully supported by the documentary evidence when considered in its totality. It is evident in reading the RPD's decision that it took all of the documentary evidence into account and was aware of its contradictory aspects vis-à-vis the Applicants' evidence. In its decision, the RPD explicitly stated that the "
preponderance
of research holds that the Mara does not resort to 'forced recruitment'" [emphasis added]; it did not rule that the documentary evidence unanimously pointed to this conclusion, as the Applicants suggest the RPD did. It is also clear that the RPD relied on the documentary evidence in finding that the Applicants did not have a profile that would typically attract the MS-13 (RPD Decision at para 18, 19). Almost all of the objective evidence before the RPD demonstrated that new recruits to the MS-13 are generally from a background of poverty, unemployment and family breakdown (
see Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Honduras: The recruitment of Mara Salvatrucha (MS) and 18th Street (Calle 18 or Mara 18) gang members; whether individuals are forced to participate in gang activity (2007-December 2011), CTR at p 132; How the Street Gangs Took Central America
, CTR at p 142;
Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment, Annex 3: Honduras Profile
, CTR at p 165). Based on the evidence on file, the Court agrees that this profile does not correspond to that of the Applicants.
[38]
This being said, the Court nonetheless finds that when read in their entirety (and not only the highlighted excerpts), none of the contradictory passages advanced by the Applicants in their written representations detract from the RPD's conclusions with regard to the MS-13's recruitment pattern or the Applicants' profiles.
[39]
The Court finds that the RPD appropriately weighed the evidence, preferring its findings as to the majority of the sources in the country condition documentary evidence to that of the information advanced by the Applicants. This does not constitute a reviewable error. The Applicants are, in effect, asking the Court to reweigh the evidence which was before the RPD; and, to come to a different conclusion. The Court cannot, however, enter into such an exercise.
[40]
It was for the RPD, as a specialized tribunal and finder of fact, to weigh the evidence before it and to give it the probative value it considers appropriate. The Court cannot infer that the RPD did not consider all of the evidence before it because it did not refer to every piece of potentially contradictory information submitted in its decision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47). The Applicants' written representations do not advance any argument that invalidates the RPD's decision.
(2)
Is the RPD's determination that the Applicants faced a generalized risk reasonable
? and,
(3)
Is the RPD's determination that there is an IFA available in Honduras reasonable
?
[42]
This Court has long held that an applicant's failure to prove that the RPD's credibility findings are unreasonable is sufficient to defeat an application (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[43]
As the RPD's decision was centered on a negative credibility finding, the generalized nature of the risk or the availability of an IFA cannot, in and of itself, provide a basis for intervention by the Court. For this reason, these issues need not be examined.
VII.
Conclusion
[44]
For all of the above reasons, the Applicants' application for judicial review is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[45]
THIS COURT ORDERS that the Applicants' application for judicial review be dismissed with no question of general importance to be certified.

Luis Fernando Bueso Trochez et  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Shore
[Traduction]: Les demandeurs sollicitent le contrôle judiciaire de la décision, datée du 14 janvier 2013, rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés (la SPR) de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié par laquelle celle-ci a décidé qu'aucun des demandeurs n'avait la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention, au sens de l'article 96 ni celle de personne à protéger, au sens de l'article 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR).
II.
Contexte
[2]
Les demandeurs, M. Luis Fernando Bueso Trochez et M. Lesther Enrique Bueso Trochez sont des frères et sont citoyens du Honduras. Ils sont nés et ont grandi dans la ville de San Pedro Sula.
[3]
En 2001, les parents des demandeurs ont immigré illégalement aux États-Unis et ont laissé les deux frères aux soins de leur grand-mère.
[4]
En février 2005, les demandeurs ont commencé à fréquenter le Centro Educativo en Computacion.
[5]
Selon le Formulaire de renseignements personnels des demandeurs (FRP):
a) En mars 2005, le demandeur, M. Lesther Bueso, a été abordé par des membres du gang criminel Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13) à l'extérieur de leur école, et, quand il a refusé de se joindre à leur gang, il a été sévèrement battu;
b) En mai 2005, l'autre demandeur, le jeune frère de Lesther Bueso, Luis Bueso, a été exposé à une demande semblable de se joindre au gang et, quand il a refusé, il a été battu et poignardé dans la partie supérieure du bras gauche. Il a dû se rendre à un hôpital de régional;
c) La famille des demandeurs a tenté de déposer une plainte à la police de l'endroit; toutefois, sans renseignements supplémentaires, la police les a avisés qu'elle ne pouvait rien faire;
d) En juin 2005, les demandeurs sont allés vivre chez leur tante à San Pedro Sula, et ensuite, en décembre 2005, chez leur grand-père dans la ville de Comayagua;
e) En février 2006, les demandeurs ont décidé de quitter le Honduras pour vivre avec leurs parents aux États-Unis. Ils ont traversé le Guatemala et le Mexique, en voiture, et le 16 mars 2006, ils ont franchi avec succès la frontière du Mexique et des États-Unis à pied, à McAllen, au Texas.
[6]
Les demandeurs ont été réunis avec leurs parents, à Miami, et ils sont demeurés aux États-Unis sans statut légal pendant plus de 5 ans.
[7]
Les demandeurs sont arrivés au Canada le 26 mars 2011, et ont demandé l'asile quelques jours plus tard.
[8]
Les demandeurs ont déclaré qu'en raison de menaces constantes faites à leur frère German Bueso, ils craignaient de retourner au Honduras. Ils ont le sentiment que leur famille est prise pour cible par le gang MS-13, parce qu'ils avaient refusé de joindre leurs rangs en 2005.
III.
Décision soumise au contrôle
[9]
Le 14 janvier 2013, la SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile des demandeurs.
[10]
Dès le début, la SPR a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas établi de lien avec l'un des motifs prévus par la Convention. Comme les demandeurs ont souscrit à l'audience à la conclusion concernant la Convention, la SPR n'a pas davantage discuté de cette question dans sa décision relative à l'un des motifs de la Convention (transcription de l'audience, à la page 17).
[11]
Ayant conclu que le bien-fondé de la demande, basée sur l'article 96, n'avait pas été établi, la SPR a ensuite examiné la question de savoir si les critères de l'article 97 de la LIPR avaient été satisfaits. La SPR a conclu que la preuve présentée par les demandeurs n'était pas fiable; ils n'ont donc pas établi qu'ils étaient exposés à une menace à leurs vies ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités au sens de l'article 97 de la LIPR.
[12]
La SPR a relevé l'absence de précision dans la demande des demandeurs; ils n'ont pas pu identifier un seul des membres du gang qui avait tenté de les recruter, bien qu'ils aient allégué que ces derniers étaient très connus dans leur quartier. La SPR a aussi conclu qu'il était peu probable que les membres du MS-13 continuent de rechercher les demandeurs des années après qu'ils eurent quitté le pays. Se référant à la preuve documentaire, la SPR a souligné qu'elle ne concluait pas que les demandeurs correspondaient au profil des jeunes recrutés par le MS-13, ou même que le type de recrutement du MS-13 en était généralement un de recrutement forcé.
[13]
La SPR a aussi tiré une inférence défavorable d'une incohérence importante entre le FRP et le témoignage des demandeurs, relativement à la date où ils ont quitté l'école dans laquelle ils avaient été agressés. Dans leur FRP, les demandeurs ont mentionné qu'ils avaient quitté l'école en novembre 2005; toutefois, à l'audience, les demandeurs ont dit qu'ils avaient quitté l'école immédiatement après les agressions du printemps 2005. La SPR a relevé que les dates données à l'audience auraient été mentionnées dans l'exposé circonstancié de leur FRP, si les allégations avaient été vraies, « étant donné que de telles actions étayeraient la question du risque ».
[14]
Vu ces problèmes de crédibilité, vu le manque général de preuve corroborant leur récit, la SPR a conclu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, les demandeurs ne s'étaient pas acquittés du fardeau qui leur incombait d'établir que leurs allégations de risque de torture étaient vraies.
[15]
En plus de cette conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité, la SPR a aussi conclu que le risque de torture allégué par les demandeurs était de nature généralisée et qu'un grand nombre de jeunes personnes au Honduras qui sont prises pour cibles par des gangs tels que le MS-13 y étaient exposées. Comme le risque était de nature généralisé, qu'il ne visait pas particulièrement les demandeurs eux-mêmes; même s'ils avaient été jugés crédibles, les dispositions de l'article 97 n'auraient pas été applicables aux demandeurs. La SPR a cité les décisions
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  à l'appui de cette conclusion.
[16]
De plus, la SPR a conclu que les demandeurs ne s'étaient pas acquittés du fardeau d'établir que la ville de Comayagua constituait une possibilité de refuge intérieur viable (la PRI).
IV.
Questions en litige
[17]
1) La conclusion tirée par la SPR relativement à la crédibilité était-elle raisonnable?
2) La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs étaient exposés à un risque généralisé était-elle raisonnable?
3) La décision de la SPR selon laquelle il existe une PRI viable au Honduras était-elle raisonnable?

VI.
Position des parties
[19]
Les demandeurs soutiennent que la conclusion de la SPR quant à la crédibilité n'était pas raisonnable, étant donné qu'elle n'a pas tenu compte ou a mal interprété des éléments de preuve importants, notamment, en ce qui avait trait aux conclusions tirées par la SPR relativement aux méthodes de recrutement du MS-13 et aux profils des demandeurs.
[20]
Les demandeurs soutiennent aussi que la SPR a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a accordé trop de poids aux incohérences entre leur FRP et leur témoignage en ce qui a trait à la date à laquelle ils ont quitté l'école. Les demandeurs insistent sur le fait qu'une telle incohérence ne peut pas, en soi, étayer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité.
[21]
Le défendeur soutient que les demandeurs n'ont pas établi que la conclusion de la SPR portant sur l'absence de crédibilité de la demande était déraisonnable.
[22]
Le défendeur a d'abord mis l'accent sur le fait que la SPR avait compétence pour adopter une approche fondée sur le bon sens lorsqu'elle a tiré des conclusions sur la crédibilité des demandeurs, et pour tenir compte de toute divergence dans leurs demandes (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Selon le défendeur, la SPR était aussi en droit de refuser les explications des demandeurs relativement aux divergences, puisqu'elles étaient insuffisantes pour ajouter foi à leurs allégations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[23]
Le défendeur soutient ensuite qu'il était loisible à la SPR de tirer une inférence défavorable du fait que les demandeurs n'avaient pas produit de preuve documentaire corroborante pour étayer leurs allégations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[24]
Le défendeur affirme enfin qu'il était aussi raisonnable que la SPR tire des conclusions défavorables relativement aux omissions et aux contradictions entre les faits allégués dans le FRP des demandeurs et leur témoignage (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis)), au paragraphe 33;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).

La norme de contrôle applicable relativement au poids à accorder à la preuve et aux conclusions relatives à la crédibilité est la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 4).
[26]
La norme de contrôle applicable à la deuxième question en litige, à savoir si un demandeur est exposé à un risque généralisé, est aussi la décision raisonnable étant donné qu'il s'agit d'une question mixte de fait et de droit (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 11).
[27]
Enfin, la norme de contrôle applicable à la question de l'existence d'une PRI est aussi la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
1)
La conclusion tirée par la SPR relativement à la crédibilité était-elle raisonnable?
[28]
À maintes reprises, la Cour a confirmé que l'accumulation de contradictions entre le témoignage d'un demandeur, ses déclarations au point d'entrée et dans son FRP, ainsi que les omissions dans son FRP d'éléments cruciaux quant à sa demande peuvent légitimement servir de fondement à une conclusion négative quant à sa crédibilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
Ces conclusions peuvent aussi être fondées sur le bon sens, l'invraisemblance et la logique inhérente de l'exposé circonstancié du demandeur ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité). Lorsque la SPR tire de telles conclusions, elles suffisent à rejeter la demande, à moins que le dossier ne comporte une preuve documentaire indépendante et crédible permettant de les réfuter (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[30]
En l'espèce, la Cour conclut que l'exposé circonstancié des demandeurs contient un grand nombre d'importantes contradictions et invraisemblances relativement aux allégations centrales de leur demande. Par conséquent, la SPR avait des motifs de tirer une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité. Les inférences défavorables tirées par la SPR n'étaient pas seulement fondées sur des « variantes ou omissions mineures ou futiles », mais plutôt sur des éléments centraux de la demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 22;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[31]
Dans l'exposé circonstancié de leur FRP, les demandeurs ont déclaré qu'ils avaient [traduction] « peur de retourner à l'école ou même de quitter la maison » après les agressions, et qu'en juin 2005, ils ont déménagé chez leur tante dans un autre quartier en quête de sécurité (aux paragraphes 14 et 18); toutefois, plus loin dans leur FRP, ils ont indiqué qu'ils ont continué à fréquenter l'école où ils avaient été agressés (et continuellement harcelés) jusqu'en novembre 2005. À l'audience, lorsqu'on les a interrogés quant à cette contradiction, les demandeurs ont changé les dates déclarant qu'en fait ils avaient tous les deux quitté l'école peu de temps après les agressions, parce qu'ils craignaient le MS-13. Les demandeurs n'ont pas été en mesure de fournir d'explication raisonnable quant à cette incohérence entre leur FRP et leur témoignage.
[32]
Selon la Cour, cette contradiction mine grandement la crédibilité des demandeurs étant donné qu'il s'agit d'un détail important de leur demande; ce détail est directement lié à leur prétendue crainte de persécution par le MS-13. Le fait que les demandeurs auraient continué à fréquenter l'école pendant 6 mois, après les agressions, malgré que leurs agents de persécution aient tenté de les recruter de force à cet endroit, démontre qu'ils n'avaient pas de crainte subjective du gang. Selon la Cour, ce fait est suffisant pour servir de fondement à une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité.
[33]
Les demandeurs n'ont pas été en mesure d'expliquer de façon satisfaisante à la SPR la raison pour laquelle ils n'ont pas pu identifier un seul des membres du MS-13, bien qu'ils étaient prétendument très connus dans la communauté. Ils n'ont également fourni aucun élément de preuve objectif étayant leur explication en ce qui a trait à la question de savoir pourquoi ils étaient pris pour cibles par le MS-13 ou comment les agressions ont eu lieu (par exemple, des rapports médicaux, des rapports de police, etc.).
[34]
La seule preuve documentaire fournie à la SPR relativement aux prétendues agressions était des certificats médicaux délivrés par une clinique de Montréal en 2009 confirmant que les deux demandeurs avaient subi des blessures dans le passé. La SPR a accordé peu de valeur probante à cet élément de preuve, parce que ce n'était que récemment qu'il avait été obtenu, et qu'il ne faisait que répéter une version des faits que la SPR avait estimé invraisemblable; les certificats ne confirmaient pas l'origine des blessures des demandeurs. La SPR était en droit de conclure que cet élément de preuve documentaire n'était pas suffisant pour donner foi à l'exposé circonstancié des demandeurs, et, par conséquent, elle a décidé d'y accorder peu de poids.
[35]
À maintes reprises, la Cour a décidé qu'une conclusion générale de manque de crédibilité d'un demandeur peut
avoir un effet sur tous les éléments de preuve pertinents présentés par le demandeur
, notamment la preuve documentaire, et en fin de compte entraîner le rejet de sa demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 9;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[36]
Dans leurs observations écrites, les demandeurs ont principalement critiqué la SPR au motif qu'elle n'avait pas pris en compte des extraits précis de la preuve documentaire avant de contredire leur exposé circonstancié (voir les documents dans le dossier certifié du tribunal (DCT), aux pages 132 et 183). La Cour ne peut pas adhérer au point de vue des demandeurs selon lequel la SPR a commis une erreur dans sa décision parce qu'elle a mal interprété cette preuve ou qu'elle n'en a pas tenu compte.
[37]
Selon la Cour, les conclusions de la SPR étaient pleinement étayées par la preuve documentaire, lorsqu'on la prend dans son ensemble. Quand on lit la décision de la SPR, il est évident que celle-ci a pris en compte tous les éléments de preuve documentaire, et qu'elle était consciente que cette preuve comportait des contradictions par rapport à la preuve des demandeurs. Dans sa décision, la SPR a déclaré de façon explicite que selon «
la plupart
des recherches, la Mara ne procède pas au [traduction] "recrutement forcé" » [Non souligné dans l'original.]; contrairement à ce que les demandeurs ont donné à penser, la SPR n'a pas jugé que, compte tenu de l'ensemble de la preuve documentaire, cette conclusion s'imposait. Il est aussi clair que la SPR s'est fondée sur la preuve documentaire lorsqu'elle a conclu que les demandeurs n'avaient pas le profil type des personnes que le MS-13 recrute (décisions de la SPR, aux paragraphes 18 et 19). Presque toute la preuve objective dont la SPR disposait établissait que les nouvelles recrues du MS-13 étaient généralement des personnes qui vivaient dans un contexte de pauvreté, de chômage, et de foyers brisés (
voir La Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada, Honduras: Information sur le recrutement des membres de la Mara Salvatrucha (MS) et du gang 18th Street (Calle 18 ou Mara 18); information indiquant si des personnes sont contraintes de participer à des activités d'un gang (2007-décembre 2011),
DCT, à la page 132; Comment les gangs de rue ont pris contrôle de l'Amérique centrale
, DCT, à la page 142;
Évaluation des gangs en Amérique et au Mexique, annexe 3: Profil du Honduras
, DCT, à la page 165). Sur la foi de la preuve contenue au dossier, la Cour convient que ce profil ne correspond pas à celui des demandeurs.
[38]
Cela dit, la Cour conclut néanmoins que, lorsqu'on les lit dans leur ensemble (et non pas seulement les extraits surlignés), aucun des extraits contradictoires mentionnés par les demandeurs dans leurs observations écrites ne réfute les conclusions tirées par la SPR relativement au profil type des personnes que le MS-13 recrute ou aux profils des demandeurs.
[39]
La Cour conclut que la SPR a adéquatement soupesé la preuve lorsqu'elle a accordé la préférence à ses conclusions tirées au sujet de la majorité des sources contenues dans la preuve documentaire relative à la situation dans le pays, plutôt qu'aux renseignements soumis par les demandeurs. Cela ne constitue pas une erreur susceptible de contrôle. En effet, les demandeurs demandent à la Cour de soupeser de nouveau la preuve qui a été soumise à la SPR, et de tirer une conclusion différente. La Cour ne peut toutefois pas se livrer à un tel exercice.
[40]
Il appartenait à la SPR, un tribunal spécialisé et juge des faits, de soupeser la preuve qui lui était soumise et de lui accorder la valeur probante qu'elle estimait appropriée. La Cour ne peut pas conclure que la SPR n'a pas pris en compte toute la preuve qui lui était présentée, parce qu'elle n'a pas fait référence à chacun des éléments de preuve qui pouvaient contredire l'information présentée dans sa décision (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[41]
La Cour conclut que, globalement, la décision de la SPR relative à la crédibilité appartient « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). Dans leurs observations écrites, les demandeurs n'avancent aucun argument qui invalide la décision de la SPR.
2)
La conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle les demandeurs étaient exposés à un risque généralisé était-elle raisonnable
?
3)
La décision de la SPR selon laquelle il existe une PRI viable au Honduras était-elle raisonnable
?
[42]
La Cour soutient depuis longtemps que le défaut d'un demandeur de prouver que la conclusion tirée par la SPR concernant l'absence de crédibilité est déraisonnable suffit pour faire échec à la demande (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[43]
Vu que la décision de la SPR était axée autour d'une conclusion défavorable quant à la crédibilité, la nature généralisée du risque ou l'existence d'une PRI, elle ne peut pas, en soi, justifier l'intervention de la Cour. Pour ce motif, ces questions n'ont pas à être examinées.
VII.

Pour tous les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire des demandeurs est rejetée.
JUGEMENT
[45]
