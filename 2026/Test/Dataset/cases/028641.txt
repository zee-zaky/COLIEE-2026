INTRODUCTION
[1]
Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application for judicial review of the failure on the part of the respondent, effective the 4th of February, 1999, to grant permanent resident status and a record of landing docu­ment to the applicant Nassim Mohammad Popal (the "principal applicant") and, effec­tive the same day, the failure of the respon­dent to issue immigrant visas to the other applicants herein, being the wife and the children of the principal applicant. Further, the principal applicant seeks judicial review of the failure on the part of the respondent to return to him certain of his identity docu­ments that were seized by the respondent.
[2]
The applicants seek the following reliefs:
"1. That the application be allowed, and a writ of certiorari be issued quashing, set­ting aside, or declaring invalid the non-decision of the respondent to grant the applicant Nassim Mohammad Popal his permanent resident status and issue him a Record of Landing document.
"2. That the application be allowed, and a writ of mandamus be issued ordering the respondent to grant the applicant Nassim Mohammad Popal his permanent resident status and issue him a Record of Landing document.
"3. That the application be allowed, and a writ of certiorari be issued quashing, set­ting aside , or declaring invalid the non-decision of the respondent to issue immi­grant visas to the other applicants herein ...
"4. That the application be allowed, and a writ of mandamus be issued ordering the respondent to issue immigrant visas to the other applicants herein ...
"5. That the application be allowed, and a writ of certiorari be issued quashing, set­ting aside, or declaring invalid the non-decision of the respondent to return the identification documents of the applicant Nassim Mohammed Popal, namely, his expired Afghan passport, Afghan driver's licence, Afghan marriage certificate, and Afghan Identity booklet.
"6. That the application be allowed, and a writ of mandamus be issued ordering the respondent to return to the applicant Nassim Mohammad Popal his identification documents, namely, his expired Afghan passport, Afghan driver's licence, Afghan marriage certificate, and Afghan Identity booklet."
BACKGROUND
[3]
By decision dated the 15th of November, 1994, the principal applicant, who alleges he is a citizen of Afghanistan, was determined by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to be a Convention refugee as against Afghanistan. Apparently at that time, and at all times since, the principal applicant's wife and children, the other applicants herein, have been residing in Pakistan under what the principal applicant attests to be "deplor­able conditions". The principal applicant is in his mid-fifty's. As at the 30th of March, 1999, he was a student here in Canada.
[4]
In December of 1994, the principal applicant submitted an application for perma­nent residence as a Convention refugee in accordance with the terms of section 46.04 of the
Immigration Act
[see footnote 1]. The relevant portions of that section read as follows:
"46.04 (1) Any person who is determined by the Refugee Division to be a Conven­tion refugee may, within the prescribed period, apply to an immigration officer for landing of that person and any dependant of that person, unless the Convention refugee is
(a) a permanent resident;
(b) a person who has been recognized by any country, other than Canada, as a Convention refugee and who, if removed from Canada, would be allowed to return to that country;
(c) a national or citizen of a country, other than the country that the person left, or outside of which the person remains, by reason of fear of persecu­tion; or
(d) a person who has permanently resided in a country, other than the coun­try that the person left, or outside of which the person remains, by reason of fear of persecution, and who, if removed from Canada, would be allowed to return to that country.
. . . . .
"(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, but subject to subsections (3.1) and (8), an immigration officer to whom an application is made under subsection (1) shall grant landing to the applicant, and to any dependant for whom landing is sought if the immigration officer is satisfied that neither the applicant nor any of those dependants is a person described in para­graph 19(1)(c. 1), (c. 2), (d), (e), (f), (g), (j), (k) or (l) or a person who has been convicted of an offence under any Act of Parliament for which a term of imprison­ment of
(a) more than six months has been imposed; or
(b) five years or more may be imposed.
"(3.1) An immigration officer may grant landing under subsection (3) only if
(a) the time normally limited for filing an application for leave to commence an application for judicial review under the Federal Court Act in respect of the Refu­gee Division's determination that the person is a Convention refugee has elapsed without such an application having been filed; or
(b) where the Minister has filed an appli­cation for leave to commence an applica­tion for judicial review under the Federal Court Act within the time normally limited for doing so, a judgment is made in respect of the Refugee division's determination by the Federal Court - Trial Division, Federal Court of Appeal or Supreme Court of Canada that finally disposes of the matter.
"(4) An immigration officer who grants landing to an applicant pursuant to this section may impose terms and conditions of a prescribed nature in connection therewith.
. . . . .
"(8) An immigration officer shall not grant landing either to an applicant under sub­section (1) or to any dependant of the applicant until the applicant is in pos­session of a valid and subsisting passport or travel document or a satisfactory ident­ity document."
"46.04 (1) La personne à qui le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention est reco­nnu par la section du statut peut, dans le délai réglementaire, demander le droit d'établissement à un agent d'immigration pour elle-même et les personnes à sa charge, sauf si elle se trouve dans l'une des situations suivantes:
a) elle est un résident permanent;
b) un autre pays lui a reconnu le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention et elle serait, en cas de renvoi du Canada, autorisée à retourner dans ce pays;
c) elle a la nationalité ou la citoyenneté d'un autre pays que celui qu'elle a quitté ou hors duquel elle est demeurée de crainte d'être persécutée;
d) elle a résidé en permanence dans un autre pays que celui qu'elle a quitté ou hors duquel elle est demeurée de crainte d'être persécutée et elle serait, en cas de renvoi du Canada, autorisée à retourner dans ce pays.
. . . . .
"(3) Malgré les autres dispositions de la présente loi mais sous réserve des parag­raphes (3.1) et (8), l'agent d'immigration accorde le droit d'établissement à l'intér­essé et aux personnes à sa charge visées par la demande, s'il est convaincu qu'au­cun d'entre eux n'est visé à l'un des alin­éas 19(1)c. 1), c. 2), d), e), f), g), j), k) ou l) ou n'a été déclaré coupable d'une infrac­tion prévue par une loi fédérale:
a) soit pour laquelle une peine d'empris­onnement de plus de six mois a été infli­gée;
b) soit passible d'un emprisonnement maximal égal ou supérieur à cinq ans.
"(3.1) L'agent ne peut toutefois accorder le droit d'établissement :
a) dans tous les cas, avant l'expiration du délai normal de présentation d'une demande d'autorisation relative à la présentation aux termes de la Loi sur la Cour fédérale d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision de la section du statut;
b) dans le cas où le ministre a présenté la demande d'autorisation dans le délai visé à l'alinéa a), avant qu'un jugement ne soit rendu quant à la décision de la sec­tion du statut par la Section de première instance de la Cour fédérale, par la Cour d'appel fédérale ou par la Cour suprême du Canada, selon le cas, qui mette fin à l'affaire.
"(4) S'il accorde le droit d'établissement, l'agent d'immigration peut imposer des conditions réglementaires à l'intéressé.
. . . . .
"(8) Tant que l'intéressé n'est pas en pos­session d'un passeport ou d'un document de voyage en cours de validité ou de pap­iers d'identité acceptables, l'agent d'immi­gration est tenu de lui refuser, ainsi qu'aux personnes à sa charge, le droit d'établisse­ment."
[5]
The principal applicant's wife and children, the co-applicants herein, were included in the principal applicant's applica­tion.
[6]
By letter dated the 23rd of January, 1996, more than a year after the principal applicant's application, the principal appli­cant was advised that he was required to provide additional identity documentation. A copy of a passport was specifically identified as appropriate identity documentation.
[7]
The principal applicant applied through the Afghan Consulate General in New York City for an Afghan passport. A passport was issued to him valid for the period from the 11th of March, 1996 to the 10th of March, 1997. Counsel for the applicant forwarded a notarized copy of the passport to the respon­dent under cover of a letter dated the 21st of March, 1996.
[8]
By letter dated the 15th of July, 1996, counsel for the principal applicant enquired of the respondent whether any additional documentation was required. In response, by facsimile dated the 22nd of July, 1996, the respondent indicated no dissatisfaction with the notarized copy of the principal appli­cant's passport and further that:
"It appears all we are waiting for are the results of the overseas checks for [the applicant's] dependants."
[9]
Counsel for the principal applicant made written inquiries of the respondent over the following months on a number of occasions requesting status reports. No response was received until the 9th of April, 1998.
[10]
On the 9th of April, 1998, the principal applicant was advised by the respondent that he was scheduled for a "landing appoint­ment" on the 20th of April, 1998 at the Canada Immigration Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario. The principal applicant attended the scheduled "landing appointment". He was requested at the appointment to provide "personal identification" before a record of landing would be issued. The principal applicant displayed to the interviewing officer the originals of his now expired Afghan passport, his Afghan driver's licence with a translation, his Ontario driver's licence card and his Ontario provincial health insurance card. The principal appli­cant's Afghan driver's licence that he dis­played during the landing appointment had been submitted as proof of his identity dur­ing his Convention Refugee Determination Division hearing in 1994, and its authenticity had apparently been found to be satisfactory.
[11]
The principal applicant was advised that the documentation he had provided and displayed was not satisfactory. He was requested to obtain other identification docu­ments such as an original marriage certificate or a birth certificate. He was advised that his record of landing would be issued only upon provision of satisfactory identification. This, some 39 or 40 months after his application for landing and more than two years after the notarized copy of the passport was pro­vided to the respondent.
[12]
The principal applicant arranged to have his original marriage certificate and original identity booklet sent by courier from his family in Pakistan. He also arranged to have those documents translated into English. After some delay following the transfer of his file between offices of the respondent, the original of the principal applicant's expired passport, his Afghan driver's licence, his marriage certificate with translation, and his identity booklet with translation were provided to the respondent. This was appar­ently at about the end of July, 1998.
[13]
On or about the 14th of September, 1998, the respondent wrote to the applicant to advise that the additional identity docu­mentation he had submitted was not satisfac­tory, that the respondent was stopping the processing on his immigration file, and that his identity booklet and marriage certificate had been seized pursuant to subsection 110­(2) of the
Immigration Act
. While the principal applicant's expired Afghan passport and Afghan driver's licence were apparently not formally seized, they were not returned to him. Material from the remarkably sparse tribunal record on this application indicates that both the marriage certificate and the identity booklet submitted by the principal applicant
"... contain alteration (sic) which render them unacceptable for the purposes of A46.04.
"The marriage certificate contains white-out (sic) and write-overs in the age at time of marriage section.
"The Identity Document has erasures and overwriting ...
"Documents will be seized and forwarded to Intelligence for review and observation."
[14]
Notices of seizure of the principal applicant's identity booklet and marriage certificate indicate that "feedback" on the seized documents was requested, presumably from "Intelligence". In the event, the identity documents were never forwarded to "Intelli­gence" for verification of the respondent's concerns. Material before the Court indicates that this failure to seek verification or "feed­back" was not discovered and disclosed to the principal applicant for many, many months. As late as the 21st of January, 2000, in response to written questions posed to the respondent's affiant in this matter, the affiant replied:
"The documents that were seized were fowarded to our Regional Intelligence Office on September 14, 1998 and feed­back was requested as to the erasures and information that was written over the documents. I have not received any feed­back to date."
No feedback was received because, in truth, the documents were never submitted for verification or feedback.
[15]
The principal applicant was further advised through a staff member in the office of a Member of Parliament, in early Octo­ber, 1998, about the seizure of his docu­ments and about the respondent's concerns with those documents. The staff member apparently advised the respondent by letter dated the 28th of October, 1998 that rela­tives of the principal applicant were willing to attest to his identity. Apparently no response was received. Nonetheless, the principal applicant forwarded to the respon­dent an affidavit sworn by his brother attest­ing to the principal applicant's identity. No acknowledgement of receipt of this affidavit was provided.
[16]
In a response to written questions, the respondent's affiant disclosed the following text received the 24th of June, 1999 from a visa officer for the respondent at Islamabad:
"This refers to your e-mail addressed to Islamabad concerning the above-named [presumably, the principal applicant]. Our file B033894195. Sorry you didn't quote your file number.
"Marriage Certificates in Afghanistan and Pakistan are completed, generally by the "Mullah" who is authorized to perform marriages under the Muslim Law. Mullahs are usually self-selected volunteers who, while they have a good knowledge of the Coran, most are uneducated. To see Nikah Nama (marriage certificate) with erasures and white-out areas is a common occur­rence. They are also very often incomplete and contain wrong information, neverthe­less they are genuine.
"In the case of the Afghans, your client has two more documents than the majority of the Afghans we interview here. Very often, the relationship is established by inquisitive interviews on the knowledge of each other, family photos. For the last 20 years, docu­ments from Afghanistan are almost inexist­ant. ID cards have no more weight than the word of the applicant.
"In this particular case, it is true that we have accepted the documents as submitted. We have no means to verify the authentic­ity of documents from Afghanistan. The interviewing officer, who is no longer at this post, simply wrote that the relationship was established. The interview was more to determine the eligibility of overaged dependents.
"Having said this, this application has been dragging for more than 4 years now and we would like to conclude it as soon as possible. They have been through medical examination twice and the last results are expired: however, should you land the HOF, we will issue visa without further medicals as per A46.04(3)."
[17]
The visa officer's comments disclose that the respondent applies different stan­dards in the determination of satisfactory identification in cases such as this, in differ­ent circumstances. I find it of interest to note that, in Islamabad, much closer to the reality of the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the principal applicant's documentation was found to be much above the average for persons fleeing Afghanistan. A different, and obviously much more stringent standard was applied within the safety and security of the boundaries of Canada.
[18]
On the 22nd of June, 1999, more than four months after this application for judicial review was filed, the respondent wrote to the principal applicant, in part in the following terms:
"This refers to your application for perma­nent residence. Although you were eligible to apply as a Convention Refugee, further processing of your application is not pos­sible.
"Section 46.04(8) of The Immigration Act states that landing shall not be granted until the applicant is in possession of a valid and subsisting passport, travel docu­ment or satisfactory identity document.
"The identity document you have sub­mitted does not meet the requirement of 46.04(8) of The Immigration Act. As you are unable to comply with this require­ment, we have suspended processing of your application for permanent residence.
. . . . .
"If, at some time in the future, you feel you are able to comple (sic) with the re­quirements of 46.04(8), please provide Etobicoke CIC with the original passport, travel or identity document and we will review it."
In addition, the letter advises the principal applicant regarding the Undocumented Con­vention refugee in Canada Class (the "UCRCC") and of the process for applying as a member of that class.
[19]
Whether through the initiative of the respondent or otherwise, the principal appli­cant became aware that, effective six months before the expiration of 5 years from the date he was determined to be a Convention refugee, he was entitled to apply for landing in Canada as a member of the UCRCC. That class is defined in subsection 2(1) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978 [see foot­note 2] in the following terms:
"member of the undocumented Convention refugee in Canada class" means a Conven­tion refugee
(a) who has been determined to be a Convention refugee, where all rights of appeal and judicial review have been exhausted and a period of five years has elapsed since the date of that determina­tion,
(b) who has not been the subject of a decision of the Refugee Division under subsection 69.3(4) of the Act resulting in the cessation or vacation of the mem­ber's status as a Convention refugee,
(c) whose country of nationality or, if stateless, whose country of former habit­ual residence is a country, set out in Schedule XII, that is in turmoil and does not have a central authority that can issue identity documents,
(d) who applied to an immigration officer pursuant to subsection 46.04(1) of the Act for landing as a Convention refugee and was not granted landing, in accordance with subsection 46.04(8) of the Act, for the sole reason of not being in possession of a valid and subsisting passport or travel document or a satisfac­tory identity document, and
(e) who has paid the applicable fees, in respect of the application referred to in paragraph (d), under the Immigration Act Fees Regulations that were in effect at the time the application was made;"
"réfugié au sens de la Convention se trouvant au Canada sans pièces d'identité" Réfugié au sens de la Convention, à la fois:
a) à qui le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention est reconnu selon la Loi, les recours en appel et en contrôle judiciaire étant épuisés et cinq ans s'étant écoulés depuis la date de cette reconnaissance;
b) qui n'a fait l'objet d'aucune décision de la section du statut, en vertu du para­graphe 69.3(4) de la Loi, entraînant la perte ou l'annulation de son statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention;
c) dont le pays de nationalité ou, s'il est apartide, le pays dans lequel il avait sa résidence habituelle est un pays mention­né à l'annexe XII, en état de trouble, qui n'a pas d'organe central pouvant délivrer des pièces d'identité;
d) qui a demandé le droit d'établissement à titre de réfugié au sens de la Conven­tion à un agent d'immigration conformé­ment au paragraphe 46.04(1) de la Loi, lequel droit lui a été refusé, en applica­tion du paragraphe 46.04(8) de la Loi, au seul motif qu'il n'était pas en possession d'un passeport ou d'un document de voyage en cours de validité ou de papiers d'identité acceptables; et
e) qui a payé les droits qui s'appliquai­ent, au moment de la demande visée à l'alinéa d), à celle-ci conformément au Règlement sur les droits exigibles - Loi sur l'immigration."
The countries identified in Schedule XII to the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978 are Afghanistan and Somalia.
[20]
Without forsaking his efforts to be landed under the provisions of section 46.04 of the
Immigration Act
, the principal appli­cant filed an application to be landed as a member of the UCRCC on the 19th of July, 1999, some three months after the time when he was first eligible to file such an applica­tion. On the 21st of September, 1999, the principal applicant was granted approval in principle for landing as a member of that class. He remained not landed at the date of hearing of this application, while "back­ground and security checks" are being con­ducted.
[21]
In the meantime, more than five years after the principal applicant was determined under Canadian law to be a Convention refugee as against Afghanistan, his wife and children, whom he had not seen for over six years as of the 30th of March, 1999, con­tinue to languish in limbo in Pakistan. The principal applicant himself remains in sus­pended animation in Canada. His children continue to grow older. One of his children is now of an age where he can no longer sponsor that child as a dependant. Another apparently approaches that age.
CONTEXT
[22]
The situation of the principal applicant herein and his family is apparently far from unique although, arguably at least, and cer­tainly in the view of an officer of the re­spondent's ministry in Islamabad, it is distin­guishable from that of many persons deter­mined to be Convention refugees who find themselves in Canada in similar situations. Certainly not all of those who find them­selves in similar situations to the principal applicant will have a spouse, and children who are inexorably aging and therefore losing dependant status in relation to their father, in what the principal applicant describes as "deplorable conditions", outside of this country. Not all families of similarly situated persons will have been separated in the manner in which this family finds itself.
[23]
A Regulatory Impact Analysis State­ment related to amendments to the
Immigra­tion Regulations
, 1978 that amended the definition "member of the undocumented Convention refugee in Canada class" in 1999 [see footnote 3] provides some insight as to why the UCRCC was developed and the objectives to which it is directed. The Regu­latory Impact Analysis Statement reads in part as follows:
"Paragraph 114(1)(e) of the
Immigration Act
allows the Governor-in-Council to create classes of immigrants and to pre­scribe landing requirements in regulation in order to grant permanent resident status (landing) to persons on public policy or compassionate or humanitarian grounds. These amendments renew Schedule XII of the
Immmigration Regulations
, 1978, i.e., the country list to which the regulations apply, as well as the sunset clause con­tained in the Regulations.
"The Undocumented Convention Refugees in Canada Class (UCRCC) was created as a class for public policy reasons. The creation of this class allows for the grant of permanent residence to undocumented refugees from specified countries – cur­rently Somalia and Afghanistan. Special provision has been made for citizens of these countries in recognition of the fact that extreme turmoil exists within both countries and that that turmoil has pre­vented and continues to prevent refugees who are citizens or nationals of Somalia and Afghanistan from complying with the current legislative requirement for passport, travel document or other satisfactory ident­ity document before being granted perma­nent residence in Canada. In both these cases, the lack of an effective central gov­ernment has meant that, for some time, no reliable identity documents, in any official form, have been available to citizens or nationals of the two countries.
. . . . .
"Since there no exception to the require­ment for an identity document, a growing number of Convention refugees who lacked a satisfactory identity document were not granted permanent residence status. Prior to the creation of the UCRCC Class, many faced indefinite and possibly perpetual inability to comply with the requirements for permanent residence status. A refugee lacking a satisfactory identity document could not sponsor the admission to Canada of immediate family members who remain abroad, could never aspire to Canadian citizenship, and would not as a result, ever become fuly inter­grated into Canadian society. At the time the UCRCC provisions were implemented, it was estimated that there were approxi­mately 7,500 refugees in Canada whose country of origin was Somalia or Afghanistan and who had not been granted permanent residence due to lack of a satis­factory identity document.
"It was recognized that the great majority of persons in this situation were genuine refugees who, through no fault of their own, were unable to obtain an identity document from their country of origin due to existence within the country of turmoil to the extent that there was (and still is) no central authority in place able to issue identity documents. It was also recognized that our desire to facilitate landing for refugees from such countries must be balanced with our commitment to protect Canada from the small majority of individ­uals who would willfully conceal their identity or country of origin, for the pur­pose of hiding information that could adversely affect their entitlement to protec­tion in Canada. In this regard, UCRCC class applicants are required to make a solemn declaration regarding the accuracy and completeness of the information pro­vided with respect to identity. This declar­ation confirms that the information is consistent with that provided to the Refu­gee Division when the refugee claim was made, or identifies and explains any differ­ences between the information provided now and that provided at the time of the refugee claim.
"A principal eligibility criterion for UCRCC is the passage of a significant period of time from the date of determina­tion of Convention refugee status. The current waiting period is of five years. As part of new directions for immigration and refugee policy and legislation, announced on January 6, 1999, the government is proposing balanced measures to strengthen the refugee protection system while main­taining the safety of Canadian society, including the reduction of the waiting period for undocumented refugees from five to three years.
"The waiting period provides a necessary balance between providing protection to those individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution and safeguarding Canada and Canadians against those individuals who would abuse Canada's generosity by willfully concealing their identities in order to hide a criminal past or conceal their true country of origin.
The waiting period allows the opportunity of detecting, often with the assistance of the communities of which they are members, those with his­tories of criminality, human rights abuses, or other activities that would exclude them from the benefits to which refugees are entitled under the United Nations Conven­tion relating to the status of Refugees (Geneva Convention)
. As well the passage of time allows for these refugees to estab­lish their ongoing willingness to respect the laws and norms of Canadian society. Assessment of their conduct during this time in Canada serves as a substitute for the background checks that are conducted on all immigrants, including refugees, since background checks are of limited effectiveness when the name of the indi­vidual cannot be confirmed or any of the personal information corroborated by official records.
"To be eligible for consideration for mem­bership in the class, the person must: have been determined to be a Convention refu­gee in Canada; have not had his or her Convention refugee determination revoked; be a national of, or, if stateless, a former habitual resident of a country recognized as in turmoil and therefore unable to issue identity documents; have applied for per­manent residence under the regular appli­cation process in place for persons deter­mined to be Convention refugees; have paid all applicable fees associated with that application; and, not have been granted permanent residence for the sole reason of lack of a satisfactory identity document (for example, there are no serious criminal­ity or security barriers to the granting of permanent residence).
"A member of the Class is eligible to include in the UCRCC application for permanent residence only those dependants who were included on the original applica­tion for permanent residence and who have resided in Canada since the time of that application. An exception to the require­ment that dependants have been residing in Canada since the time of that application is provided for any eligible dependants who came to Canada before the date on which public notice of the Government's intent to create the Class was given (November 16, 1996). This provision differs from the current rule respecting inclusion of depend­ants of Convention refugees in applications for landing pursuant to subsection 46.04(1) of the
Act
. It was introduced in recognition of the fact that these refugees are adversely affected by lack of documentary proof of relationship. Because of the inordinate processing delays that would otherwise result, the non-inclusion of dependants outside of Canada is intended to facilitate the earliest possible conclusion of the application for permanent residence under this class for the member and any depend­ants in Canada." (emphasis added)
"L'alinéa 114(1)(e) de la
Loi sur l'immi­gration
autorise le gouverneur en conseil à créer des catégories d'immigrants et à préciser par règlement des exigences rela­tives à l'établissement afin d'accorder le statut de résident permanent (l'établisse­ment) pour des motifs humanitaires ou d'intérêt public. Les présentes modifica­tions au Règlement sur l'immigration ont pour but de renouveler l'Annexe XII du
Règlement sur l'immigration de 1978
, soit la liste des pays pour lesquels ces disposi­tions réglementaires s'appliquent, ainsi que la clause de temporarisation prévue relativement à ces dispositions.
"La catégorie des réfugiés au sens de la Convention se trouvant au Canada sans pièces d'identité (CRCCSPI) a été créée pour des motifs d'intérêt public. Elle per­met d'accorder la résidence permanente à des réfugiés sans document provenant de pays déterminés – actuellement l'Afghani­stan et la Somalie. Des dispositions spé­ciales ont été prises dans le cas de ces deux pays parce qu'il y est survenu des troubles extrêmes, et que ces troubles ont empêcher et continuent d'empêcher des réfugiés qui sont des citoyens ou des res­sortissants de ces pays de se conformer à l'exigence de la Loi selon laquelle ils doivent être en possession d'un passeport, d'un document de voyage ou d'une autre pièce d'identité acceptable pour que la résidence permanente au Canada puisse leur être octroyée. Dans les deux cas visés, il n'a pas été possible depuis un bon moment aux citoyens et aux ressortissants de ces pays d'obtenir des papiers d'identité acceptables, sous une forme officielle quelconque, à cause de l'absence d'un gouvernement central dûment établi.
. . . . .
"Comme on exigeait une pièce d'identité sans faire d'exception, de plus en plus de réfugiés au sens de la Convention n'obten­aient pas le statut de résident permanent faute de posséder une pièce d'identité acceptable. Avant l'établissement de la catégorie des RCCSPI, de nombreuses personnes risquaient de se trouver dans l'impossibilité pour une période indéter­minée, et peut-être pour toujours, de se conformer aux exigences relatives à la résidence permanente. Un réfugié sans pièce d'identité acceptable ne pouvait pas parrainer l'admission au Canada de mem­bres de sa famille immédiate se trouvant à l'étranger, ne pouvait pas aspirer à obtenir la citoyenneté canadienne et ne pouvait pas, par conséquent, s'intégrer pleinement à la société canadienne. Au moment où les dispositions relatives à la CRCCSPI ont été mises en oeuvre, on estimait qu'il y avait au Canada quelque 7 500 réfugiés venant de Somalie ou d'Afghanistan qui n'avaient pu obtenir la résidence permanente parce qu'ils n'avaient pas de pièces d'identité acceptables.
"On a reconnu que la grande majorité des personnes dans cette situation étaient d'au­thentiques réfugiés qui, sans qu'il y ait faute de leur part, ne pouvaient pas obtenir une pièce d'identité de leur pays d'origine parce que celui-ci vivait des troubles tels qu'il n'y avait pas sur place un pouvoir central en mesure de délivrer des pièces d'identité (et qu'il n'y en a toujours pas). On a également reconnu qu'il fallait conci­lier notre désir de faciliter l'établissement de réfugiés provenant de ces pays avec notre engagement à protéger le Canada contre la faible minorité de personnes cachant délibérément leur identité ou leur pays d'origine afin de dissimuler des ren­seignements qui pourraient les empêcher d'avoir droit à la protection au Canada. A cet égard, les demandeurs de la catégorie des RCCSPI sont tenus de faire une décla­ration solennelle concernant l'exactitude et l'intégralité des renseignements fournis au sujet de l'identité. Cette déclaration con­firme que les les renseignements sont conformes à ceux donnés à la Section du statut du réfugié au moment de la présenta­tion de la revendication du statut de ré­fugié, ou précisent et expliquent tout écart entre renseignements actuels et ceux don­nés au moment de la revendication du statut de réfugié.
"Un des principaux critères pour pouvoir être reconnu comme un membre de la catégorie des RCCSPI est qu'il faut qu'une importante période de temps se soit écoulée depuis la reconnaissance du statut de réfugié. Actuellement, la période d'at­tente est de cinq ans. Dans le cadre de nouvelles orientations pour la politique et la législation relatives aux immigrants et aux réfugiés annoncées le 6 janvier 1999, le gouvernement propose un ensemble cohérent de mesures visant à renforcer le système de protection des réfugiés tout en assurant la sécurité des Canadiens; ces mesures proposées comprennent la réduc­tion de cinq à trois ans de la période d'at­tente pour la catégorie des réfugiés sans papiers.
"La période d'attente garantit l'équilibre nécessaire entre notre obligation d'offrir notre protection à des personnes qui craig­nent avec raison d'être persécutées et notre obligation de protéger les Canadiens contre ceux qui voudraient abuser de notre gén­érosité en cachant sciemment leur identité pour dissimuler un passé criminel ou leur vrai pays d'origine.
Cette période nous donne la possibilité de détecter, souvent avec l'aide des collectivités auxquelles appartiennent ces personnes, celles qui ont un passé criminel, ont commis des viol­ations des droits de la personne ou sont impliquées dans d'autres activités qui les excluraient des avantages reconnus aux réfugiés par la Convention des Nations Unies relative au statut des réfugiés (Con­vention de Genève)
. Les années d'attente permettent également à ces réfugiés de démontrer qu'ils sont désireux de respecter les lois canadiennes et les règles de notre société. L'évaluation de leur comportement pendant cette période au Canada remplace la vérification des antécédents normalement effectuée pour tous les immigrants, y compris les réfugiés, étant donné que l'efficacité de ce genre de vérification est limitée si ni le nom de la personne visée ni les renseignements personnels la concer­nant ne peuvent être confirmés par des registres officiels.
"Pour être admissible à la catégorie des RCCSPI, l'intéressé doit satisfaire aux conditions suivantes: le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention lui a été reconnu au Canada; le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention ne lui a pas été retiré; l'intér­essé est un ressortissant d'un pays reconnu comme étant en plein bouleversement et donc incapable de délivrer des documents d'identité, ou, s'il est apatride, il avait antérieurement sa résidence habituelle dans un tel pays; il a demandé la résidence permanente en suivant les formalités prév­ues pour les personnes auxquelles le statut de réfugié au sens de la Convention a été reconnu, a payé tous les droits exigibles pour l'examen de cette demande, et n'a pas reçu le statut de résident permanent pour le seul motif qu'il ne peut fournir un docu­ment d'identité acceptable (par exemple, il n'y a pas de motifs sérieux de criminalité ou de sécurité qui empêchent de lui accorder la résidence permanente.)
"Les membres de la catégorie des RCCSPI n'ont le droit d'inclure dans leur demande de résidence permanente que les personnes à leur charge qui étaient incluses dans la demande originale de résidence permanente et qui ont résidé au Canada depuis cette première demande. Il est fait exception, pour les personnes à charge admissibles qui sont arrivées au Canada avant la date où le gouvernement a fait publiquement connaître son intention d'établir la catég­orie (16 novembre 1996), a l'obligation d'avoir résidé au Canada depuis la date de la demande originale. Cette disposition diffère de la règle actuelle concernant l'inclusion des personnes à charge dans les demandes de résidence permanente présen­tées par des réfugiés au sens de la Conven­tion en application du paragraphe 46.04(1) de la Loi. Elle a été proposée parce que le fait de ne pas avoir de papiers d'identité prouvant la relation avec les personnes à leur charge nuit à ces réfugiés. Pour accél­érer au maximum le règlement de la demande de résidence permanente des réfugiés de cette catégorie et de toutes les personnes à leur charge déjà au Canada, les personnes à charge encore à l'étranger n'ont pas été incluses, car les délais de traitement seraient extrêmement longs." (Je souligne)
COMMENTARY
[24]
Four points from the foregoing quota­tion from the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement accompanying amendments to the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978 as they relate to the definition "member of the un­documented Convention refugee in Canada class" are worthy of note. First, as at the date of the implementation of the UCRCC program, the class in question was not small: it was estimated to include approximately 7,500 refugees in Canada whose country of origin was Somalia or Afghanistan and who had not been granted permanent residence due to a lack of satisfactory identity docu­ments. That number does not reflect the number of dependants both within Canada and outside Canada who had not themselves been found to be Convention refugees. Second, the government was contemplating the reduction of the waiting period for mem­bers of the UCRCC from five years to three years. Third, the class hardly benefits depen­dants outside Canada. Fourth, the waiting period was intended to be used to allow identification of non-deserving claimants. There was no evidence before the Court in this matter to demonstrate that the waiting period had been so used by the respondent in the case of the principal applicant. To the contrary, the respondent would appear to have adopted an entirely passive role throughout the waiting period.
ANALYSIS
[25]
The foregoing background, context and brief commentary on the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement indicates, to this judge at least, that the respondent has demonstrated a remarkably cavalier attitude toward the hardships that the principal applicant and his family members have been enduring. Com­munication with the principal applicant would appear to have been less than full and open. Identity documents thought to be less than adequate were never sent for verifica­tion when they should have been and were alleged to have been. The difference in philosophy demonstrated in the communica­tion from a visa officer in the respondent's ministry in Islamabad from the philosophy reflected in the actions or inactions of officers in the same ministry here in Canada appears to have been dramatic. I am left with the firm impression that if this application for judicial review had not been initiated on behalf of the principal applicant and his family members, many of the potential embarrassments for the respondent's offi­cials, and perhaps indeed for the respondent herself, might have gone unnoticed.
[26]
Despite this application, the process is ongoing. In an affidavit sworn the 10th of December, 1999, the respondent's affiant attests:
"Currently, his [the principal applicant's] application is pending the results of his security and criminal clearances. The applicant's landing will be authorized when the CSIS and RCMP results are received as having been passed. As of the date of this affidavit, the results of the background checks have not yet been received."
[27]
No assurances are provided to the principal applicant, his family members or this Court as to when the CSIS and RCMP "results" might be received. The respondent appears content to respond to the applicants and this Court "when she is ready". In the meantime, she urges that we all "be patient". As indicated earlier in these reasons, in the meantime, the principal applicant's children are aging with the result that more might cease to be eligible for sponsorship to Canada by the principal applicant. The time that the principal applicant and his family members have been separated from one another continues to lengthen. And the respondent continues to hold any identity documents that might conceivably facilitate a reunion, somewhere, between the principal applicant and his spouse and children.
[28]
All of the foregoing being said, it is the action, or inaction of the respondent in failing to land the principal applicant under subsection 46.04 of the
Immigration Act
and, on the basis thereof, to issue immigrant visas to the other applicants herein that is under review in this application, not the treatment of the principal applicant under the UCRCC and any failure to lay an effective foundation in the five years preceding the principal applicant's claim to qualify as a member of that class.
Jurisdiction
[29]
Neither party to this application for judicial review, either in written material or through counsel during the hearing, ques­tioned this Court's jurisdiction to deal with this application for judicial review of what the applicants, in their application for judi­cial review, described as a "non-decision of the respondent" and what I, in an earlier decision, [see footnote 4] described as a "course of conduct". On the facts of this matter, there were at least three decisions within the context of the "non-decision" or "course of conduct"; two rejections of ident­ity documents prior to the date of filing of the application for judicial review, and a further rejection of an identity document following commencement of the application. Each of the three decisions was carefully described as not being a definitive rejection of the principal applicant's application for landing under section 46.04 of the
Immigra­tion Act
.
[30]
I am satisfied that it is now beyond doubt that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an application such as this under section 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
[see footnote 5].  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  point out that the drafters of section 18.1 employed language else­where in its text which, in their sub­mission, is designed to accommodate an application for both a section 18 remedy per se and such other remedy as is pro­vided for in subsection 18.1(3). Thus in subsection 18.1(1), the words 'anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought' appear. The Motions judge ... was of the view that the word 'matter' as repeated in former Rule 1602 is 'reflective ... of the necessity to find a word to cover a variety of adminis­trative actions.' I respectfully agree. Fur­ther support for that view was expressed after Bill C-38 which proposed this change was adopted, but before it came into force. Indeed, it seems to me that the word 'mat­ter' does embrace not only a 'decision or order' but any matter in respect of which a remedy may be available under section 18 of the
Federal Court Act
." (citation omitted)
At paragraph 23, Mr. Justice Stone wrote:
"In my view, the time limit imposed by subsection 18.1(2) does not bar the appel­lants from seeking relief by way of mandamus, prohibition and declaration."
Finally, at paragraph 24, the Court wrote:
"I am satisfied that the exercise of the jurisdiction under section 18 does not depend on the existence of a 'decision or order'."
[31]
In summary then, I am satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction to review the "course of conduct" that is before me, and, on the facts of this matter, there is no time bar against the applicants seeking relief by way of mandamus, prohibition and declar­ation. To this list, I would add certiorari.
Reviewable errors
[32]
The interview of the principal applicant on the 20th of April, 1998 is of critical importance to my determination herein. The only sworn evidence that is before the Court as to what transpired at that interview comes from the principal applicant himself. The interviewing officer's notes of the interview, contained in the tribunal record, are to the following effect:
"Unable to land subject this date as identi­fication presented unacceptable. He pres­ented Afghanistani driver's license which does not provide proof of citizenship, country of birth or date of birth. He also presented an Afghanistani passport which was issued in New York in March 1996.
He stated that this passport was issued on the basis of his Canadian social insurance card
." (emphasis added)
[33]
The principal applicant attests that he was handed a letter at the close of the inter­view. A copy of the letter is an exhibit to his affidavit and a further copy appears in the tribunal record. It is a form letter in which "Xs" have been placed in boxes beside the following statements: "You have not pres­ented sufficient identification"; and "Further processing is required." The letter provides no further explanation or guidance to the principal applicant. More particularly, no reasons whatsoever are provided as to why the identity documentation presented by the principal applicant was determined to be insufficient. This, despite the fact that the form letter provided space for such an expla­nation.
[34]
As indicated earlier in these reasons, the respondent again wrote to the principal applicant on the 14th of September, 1998. That letter reads in part as follows:
"This will acknowledge receipt of the documents you submitted to this office in support of your application for permanent residence. It has been determined that these documents do not meet Immigration re­quirements in supporting your identity. Moreover, the documents have been seized as per Section 110(2) of the Immigration Act. A copy of the seizure form is attached for your records.
"If you subsequently obtain original ident­ity documents, please forward them as soon as possible to this office. In the meantime, your application will be held in abeyance."
[35]
Once again, the identity documents in question are not identified. Further, as noted earlier in these reasons, not all identity documents submitted were seized, and no follow-up or feedback was ever requested with respect to the documents that were seized despite the fact that the "seizure form[s]" indicate that feedback had been requested.
[36]
More than four months after this appli­cation for judicial review was filed, the respondent wrote to the principal applicant on the 22nd of June, 1999. The relevant portions of that letter are quoted earlier in these reasons.
[37]
As of the date on which this application for judicial review was filed, and continuing through to the date of the hearing of this application before me, I am satisfied that the respondent committed reviewable error in her processing of the principal applicant's application for landing. For ease of refer­ence, subsection 46.04(8) is repeated here:
"(8) An immigration officer shall not grant landing either to an applicant under sub­section (1) or to any dependant of the applicant until the applicant is in pos­session of
a valid and subsisting passport
or travel document or a satisfactory ident­ity document." (emphasis added)
"(8) Tant que l'intéressé n'est pas en pos­session
d'un passeport ou d'un document de voyage en cours de validité
ou de pap­iers d'identité acceptables, l'agent d'immi­gration est tenu de lui refuser, ainsi qu'aux personnes à sa charge, le droit d'établisse­ment." (Je souligne)
[38]
As noted earlier in these reasons, the applicant was advised by letter dated the 23rd of January, 1996 that additional identity documentation was required. A copy of a passport was specifically identified as appro­priate identity documentation. The principal applicant applied through the Afghan Consu­late General in New York City for an Afghan passport and obtained one. It was valid from the 11th of March, 1996 to the 10th of March, 1997. Counsel for the appli­cant forwarded a notarized copy of the passport to the respondent under cover of a letter dated the 21st of March, 1996, clearly at a time when the passport was "subsisting".
[39]
At the interview of the principal appli­cant on the 20th of April, 1998, the principal applicant presented the original of the pass­port, then no longer "subsisting", to the interviewing officer. According to the of­ficer's notes that appear in the Tribunal Record, the passport was rejected as an identity document, presumably because it was issued "... on the basis of [the principal applicant's] Canadian Social Insurance Card.
[40]
The bases on which officials of the Afghan government choose to issue passports is a matter for that government. The basis on which the principal applicant's passport, apparently valid in the view of the Afghani officials in New York, and subsisting at the time the notarized copy of the passport was submitted, might not have been "satisfactory" to officials in the respondent's ministry, but that is not the test. Subsection 46.04(8) of the
Immigration Act
speaks only of a "valid and subsisting" passport, not a valid and subsisting passport issued on a basis "satis­factory" to the respondent. The term "satis­factory" in that subsection modifies only "identity document[s]" other than valid and subsisting passports and travel documents. I am satisfied that this interpretation is sup­ported by reference to the french language version of subsection 46.04(8).
[41]
I conclude that the respondent erred in law in rejecting the passport submitted by the principal applicant for the purposes of subsection 46.04(8).
[42]
Further, the respondent provided no explanation whatsoever, at least none that is before the Court, for the rejection of certain of the other identity documentation that was presented by the principal applicant at the 20th of April, 1998 meeting. The relevant sentence contained in the respondent's letter to the principal applicant of the 14th of September, 1998 to the effect:
"It has been determined that these docu­ments [not identified] do not meet immi­gration requirements in supporting your identity."
is no explanation or reasons at all. While the respondent might well have had good rea­sons for rejecting the principal applicant's Afghan driver's license with a translation, his Ontario driver's license card and his Ontario provincial health insurance card as "satisfactory identity document[s]", no expla­nation or reasons were given. Similarly, no explanation or reasons were given for the rejection of the affidavit of the principal applicant's brother attesting to the principal applicant's identity. I am not prepared to accept that the following sentence from the respondent's letter to the principal applicant of the 22nd of June, 1999 amounts to an explanation or reasons:
"The identity document you have sub­mitted does not meet the requirements of 46.04(8) of the
Immigration Act
."
That is not an explanation or reasons. Fur­ther, there is nothing to provide any assur­ance that the reference to "the identity docu­ment you have submitted" is a reference to the affidavit.
[43]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  context of an application for landing from within Canada on humanitarian and compas­sionate grounds, wrote at p. 848:
"In my opinion, it is now appropriate to recognize that, in certain circumstances, the duty of procedural fairness will require the provision of a written explanation for a decision. The strong arguments demon­strating the advantages of written reasons suggest that, in cases such as this where the decision has important significance for the individual, when there is statutory right of appeal, or in other circumstances, some form of reasons should be required. This requirement has been developing in the common law elsewhere. The circumstances of the case at bar, in my opinion constitute one of the situations where reasons are necessary. The profound importance of an H&C decision to those affected, ... mili­tates in favour of a requirement that rea­sons be provided. It would be unfair for a person subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to their future not to be told why the result was reached." (citations omitted)
[44]
I am satisfied that precisely the same can be said here. To paraphrase the words of Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, it would be unfair for a person or persons subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to the future of the principal appli­cant and his family members not to be told why the result was reached. On this basis as well, I am satisfied that the respondent erred in a reviewable manner in not providing reasons for the rejection of the various ident­ity documents provided by him, other than the marriage certificate and identity booklet where reasons were provided.
[45]
In the result, this application for judicial review will be allowed.
RELIEFS
[46]
All of the foregoing being said, there remains an issue as to the relief that this Court is in a position to grant to the princi­pal applicant and his family members.
[47]
The decisions of the respondent to reject the valid and subsisting passport sub­mitted by the principal applicant in support of his application for landing and that of his dependants pursuant to section 46.04 of the
Immigration Act
and the various other identity documents submitted by him, other than his identity booklet and marriage certifi­cate, are set aside and are referred back to the respondent for determination in accord­ance with law as interpreted in these reasons. Given the time that has elapsed since the original application by the principal applicant and his dependants, the respondent is urged to make the redetermination, and to provide the principal applicant with reasons for the result of the redetermination, as expeditious­ly as possible.
[48]
I am satisfied the Court can order the return to the principal applicant of his seized identity booklet and his marriage certificate. The seizure of those documents was purportedly effected under subsection 110(2) of the
Immigration Act
. The relevant por­tions of that subsection read as follows:
"(2) An immigration officer may
. . . . .
(b) seize and hold at a port of entry or any other place in Canada any thing or document if the immigration officer believes on reasonable grounds that that action is required to facilitate the carry­ing out of any provision of this Act or the regulations; and"
"(2) L'agent d'immigration a le pouvoir:
. . . . .
b) de saisir et retenir, à un point d'entrée ou ailleurs au Canada, tous objets ou documents, lorsqu'il a des motifs raison­nables de croire qu'une telle mesure s'impose pour faciliter l'application de la présente loi et de ses règlements;"
While the seizure may have been appropriate as being "... required to facilitate the carry­ing out of any provision of this
Act
or the
Regulations
", there is no evidence before the Court that the documents were so used after their seizure given that they were never submitted for verification. In the circum­stances, regardless of whatever worth these documents might have to the principal appli­cant, I can see no justification for the con­tinued retention by the respondent. [see footnote 8]
[49]
Quashing or setting aside "non-deci­sions" is very close in nature to mandamus and, for reasons that follow, I am not sat­isfied that such relief is appropriate here. On the other hand, a form of declaration is I am satisfied, justified.
[50]
Section 3 of the
Immigration Act
declares the objectives of Canadian immigra­tion policy. It provides that Canadian immi­gration policy and the rules and regulations made under the
Immigration Act
shall be designed and administered in such a manner as to promote the domestic and international interests of Canada recognizing the following needs, among others:
"(f) to ensure that any person who seeks admission to Canada on either a permanent or temporary basis is subject to standards of admission that do not discriminate in a manner inconsistent with the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
;
(g) to fulfil Canada's international legal obligations with respect to refugees and to uphold its humanitarian tradition with respect to the displaced and the persecuted;
. . . . .
(i) to maintain and protect the health, safety and good order of Canadian society; and
(j) to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canadian territory to persons who are likely to engage in criminal activity."
"f) de garantir que les personnes sollicitant leur admission au Canada à titre permanent ou temporaire soient soumises à des critères excluant toute discrimination contraire à la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés;
g) de remplir, envers les réfugiés, les obligations imposées au Canada par le droit international et de continuer à faire honneur à la tradition humanitaire du pays à l'endroit des personnes déplacées ou persécutées;
. . . . .
i) de maintenir et de garantir la santé, la sécurité et l'ordre public au Canada;
j) de promouvoir l'ordre et la justice sur le plan international en n'acceptant pas sur le territoire canadien des personnes susceptibles de se livrer à des activités criminelles."
[51]
Clearly there is a balance to be struck between the objectives reflected in paragraphs (f) and (g) quoted above and those reflected in paragraphs (i) and (j). On the facts of this matter, I am satisfied that the balance has been skewed to an unreasonable extent in favour of objectives (i) and (j) without any evidence being provided to the Court that those objectives have been diligently pursued in dealing with the situation of the principal applicant and his family members. In the result, my decision will include a declaration to the following effect:
"It is hereby declared that, on the facts of this matter as summarized in reasons given for this order, the respondent has failed to properly balance the immigration objectives reflected in paragraphs 3(f) and (g) of the
Immigration Act
with those reflected in paragraphs 3(i) and (j) by failing to diligently and effectively pursue the application for landed immigrant status of the principal applicant, Nassim Mohammad Popal and of the members of his family who are co-applicants in this application, while at the same time failing to act diligently to protect the safety and good order of Canadian society and to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canadian territory to persons who are likely to engage in criminal activity."
[52]
Relief in the nature of mandamus, beyond what I am prepared to grant regarding return of identity documents, is more problematic.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  described "several principal requirements" that must be satisfied before mandamus will issue. Given the reliefs that I am prepared to provide, against those principal requirements, I am not satisfied that further relief by way of mandamus is here justified.
CONCLUSION
[53]
In the result, I will set aside the decisions of the respondent to reject the valid and subsisting passport submitted by the principal applicant and the various other identity documents submitted by him other than his identity booklet and marriage certificate. Those decisions will be referred back to the respondent for redetermination in accordance with law as interpreted in these reasons. I will order return to the principal applicant of the identity documents submitted by him and still in the respondent's possession, however suspect they may or may not be. In addition, I will provide a declaration in the terms set out earlier in these reasons.
COSTS
[54]
Counsel for the applicants urged that, on the particular facts of this matter, there can be found special reasons for ordering costs in favour of the principal applicant. Counsel urged that those costs should be fixed in the amount of $4,000. Counsel for the respondent urged that there are no special reasons for an order of costs on this application. I favour the view of counsel for the applicant as to the existence of special reasons. The record before the Court discloses a lack of sensitivity and responsiveness to the interests of the principal applicant and his family members which appears only to have been alleviated, and then only partially and reluctantly, by the institution of this application. That being said, I will order that costs be payable by the respondent to the principal applicant fixed in the amount of $2,000.00, inclusive of disbursements.
CERTIFICATION OF A QUESTION
[55]
An unsigned copy of these reasons was distributed to counsel who were invited to consider the issue of certification of a question and to provide written representations to be followed by a teleconference if required.
[56]
Counsel for the applicant proposed no question and indicated that he would oppose certification of any question that might be proposed on behalf of the respondent.
[57]
Counsel for the respondent proposed three questions as follows:
"1. Does the time bar in ss. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, or ss. 82.1(3) of the
Immigration Act
, apply so as to bar the grant of relief in the nature of certiorari in an application for judicial review against a 'course of conduct'.
"2. Is a passport, however issued by an applicant's country of citizenship, sufficient for the purposes of ss. 46.04(8) of the
Immigration Act
, or may an immigration officer have reference to the underlying process for issuance in determining whether to accept it for the purposes of the subsection?
"3. Is it a reviewable error for an immigration officer to retain documents seized under ss. 110 of the
Immigration Act
in order to facilitate the carrying out of any provisions of the
Immigration Act
or
Regulations
, including the potential future removal of the document holder, and then not to submit those documents for verification where their authenticity may be in doubt?"
[58]
It is well established that, in order for a question to be certified pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Immigration Act
, it must be a question which transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation and contemplates issues of broad significance or general application. In addition, it must be a question that is determinative of the appeal. [see footnote 10] More recently, the Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that where a question is certified, the Court of Appeal is not limited to addressing only the certified question and issues related to it.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  certification of a 'question of general importance' is the trigger by which an appeal is justified. The object of the appeal is still the judgment itself, not the certified question."
[59]
Against the foregoing guidance, I am satisfied that the first question proposed on behalf of the respondent, with one modification, warrants certification. Relief in the nature of certiorari is not the only relief that will be granted in this matter and thus, if the question were related only to relief in the nature of certiorari, as proposed on behalf of the respondent, arguably at least, the answer to the question would not be dispositive of an appeal. The words "or any other form" will be added after the word "certiorari".
[60]
Certification of the first question in effect makes certification of the second and third proposed questions superfluous. That is not to say that I regard the second and third questions as being other than questions of broad significance or general application. But I am concerned that either of the second or third questions would not, of itself, be dispositive of an appeal in this matter. Further, the third question presupposes a purpose in retaining seized documents that had no evidentiary basis before me. There was simply nothing before the Court to indicate that the seized documents that continued to be retained by the respondent at the time of the hearing of this matter were being held to facilitate the potential future removal of the principal applicant. The only purpose for the seizure and detention of the documents disclosed in the evidence before the Court was for purposes of verification of their authenticity.
[61]
For the foregoing reasons, and particularly because certification of more than one question is not required in order for a full argument on an appeal, neither the second nor the third question will be certified.
Application allowed.
