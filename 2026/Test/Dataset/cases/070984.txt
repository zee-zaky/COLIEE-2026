McGillis, J.
: The Immigration and Refugee Board ("the Board") rejected the refugee claim of the applicant on the basis that he lacked credibility. Counsel for the applicant has challenged the decision of the Board principally on the basis that it improperly admitted into evidence a telex from the Canadian High Commission in Lagos, Nigeria containing information which varied from statements made by the applicant in his second personal information form.
[2]
The applicant, who is a citizen of Nigeria, signed two personal information forms which differ dramatically in content. In the second form, the applicant provided significant additional information in support of his refugee claim, including a statement that he had been charged with murder and released on bail in Nigeria. As a result of this statement, an issue arose as to whether the applicant would be excluded under section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
from claiming refugee status on the basis that he had committed a serious nonpolitical crime. The hearing was adjourned under s. 69.1(5) of the
Immigration Act
to give the Minister an opportunity to participate in the proceedings. The Minister filed a notice with the Board indicating his intention to participate. However, investigations conducted through Canadian diplomatic channels revealed that the applicant had not been charged with murder in Nigeria and the Minister withdrew his notice of participation. Despite the objection of counsel, the Board admitted into evidence as an exhibit the telex from the Canadian High Commission in Lagos which stated as follows:
"Officer visited Kano detachment of Nigeria police force and discussed sit [sic] with Superintendent Zarewa of Intelligence and Investigation Branch. Zarewa acknowledged that charges remain outstanding against several individuals as a result of Oct. 91 religious disturbances in Kano. Igbinosun and Igbinoba however are not amongst those sought nor has a search of records revealed any history of criminality."

In its decision, the Board gave detailed reasons in support of its negative finding of credibility, outlining "only the major and most serious contradictions" in the story of the applicant. The Board noted the serious and fundamental discrepancies between his two personal information forms and observed that the "essence of the claim" was not reflected in the first form, which was prepared at a time when the applicant had the benefit of counsel and an interpreter. The Board also found that, when the applicant was confronted with the discrepancies, he provided explanations which "... created further inconsistencies". In the latter part of its decision, the Board referred to the contradiction between the personal information form and the telex concerning the alleged murder charge and rejected the explanation given by the applicant. Furthermore, the Board cited documentary evidence which indicated that bail is denied in Nigeria to a person accused of murder.
[4]
Counsel for the applicant has submitted, among other things, that the admission into evidence of the telex from the Canadian High Commission constituted a violation of the rights of the applicant under the
Privacy Act
. In particular, he argued that the confidential statements of the applicant in the personal information form had been improperly disclosed by officials of the Canadian government.
[5]
Section 8(1) of the
Privacy Act
provides that personal information controlled by a government institution "... shall not, without the consent of the individual to whom it relates, be disclosed by the institution except in accordance with this section". The circumstances in which personal information may be disclosed without consent are outlined in s. 8(2) of the
Privacy Act
. In particular, s. 8(2)(a) of the
Privacy Act
permits the disclosure of personal information "for the purpose for which the information was obtained ... or for a use consistent with that purpose".
[6]
In the present case, the evidence establishes that the identity of the applicant was disclosed to Nigerian police officials to determine whether he had been charged with the offence of murder. There is no evidence to indicate that any confidential information given by the applicant in his personal information form was disclosed. The objection to the admissibility of the telex on the basis that the
Privacy Act
was violated has been advanced in the absence of a proper evidentiary framework and, as a result, must be rejected. Alternatively, even if Canadian officials did provide confidential information from the applicant to the Nigerian police, the disclosure was made for the purpose of permitting the Minister to formulate an opinion as to whether the claim of the applicant raised a matter within the exclusionary provision in s. F(b) of Article 1 of the
Convention
. (See s. 69.1(5)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
). Since the applicant provided the information for immigration purposes, its use, if any, by the Minister or his representatives was clearly "for a use consistent with that purpose" within the meaning of s. 8(2)(a) of the
Privacy Act
. (See also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that, following the withdrawal of the Minister from the proceedings, the evidence was admitted by the tribunal "through the back door". I disagree. The evidence was properly and lawfully obtained by the Minister to permit him to formulate an opinion concerning the potential applicability of the exclusion clause in this refugee claim. The decision by the Minister not to participate in the proceedings has no bearing on the question of the admissibility of the lawfully obtained evidence. Under s. 68(3) of the
Immigration Act
, the board has a statutory discretion to receive evidence "considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances of the case". I have no hesitation whatsoever in concluding that the Board exercised its discretion properly in admitting the telex into evidence and in considering it in the assessment of the credibility of the applicant. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 30 (F.C.A.)). Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the public interest in the proper determination of this refugee claim required that this information be considered by the Board.
[8]
Alternatively, even if the Board erred in admitting the telex into evidence, this error would not have resulted in a new hearing for the applicant. In its decision, the Board provided several detailed, cogent reasons for disbelieving the evidence of the applicant, only one of which involved a contradiction between the telex and the second personal information form. All of the reasons advanced by the Board in support of its negative credibility finding were reasonable and amply supported by the evidence. In the circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with the decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  question of general importance.
Application dismissed.
