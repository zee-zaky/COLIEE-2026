Reasons For Order
[1] Reed, J.
: The defendants bring a motion to have Tonka Canada Inc. removed as a plaintiff on the ground that a cause of action does not lie by it against the defendants. Tonka Canada Inc. is registered as a licensed user of four of the five trademarks with respect to which infringement is claimed (UCA05674; 281,802; 293, 771; 314, 318). It is argued that Tonka Canada Inc. has not complied with s. 50(4) of the Trade Marks Act and therefore it does not have a right to institute an action as a plaintiff for trademark infringement.
[2]
The plaintiffs argue that even if this were the case, Tonka Canada Inc. would still properly be a party plaintiff because the action encompasses claims in addition to those based on trademark infringement. The Statement of Claim alleges a passing off contrary to ss. 7(b) and 7(c) of the Trade Marks Act. The defendants contend, however, that the pleadings respecting passing off (paragraphs 13(b) and 13(c) of the Statement of Claim) should be struck out because they contain no allegations of fact and are a mere paraphrase of the respective statutory provisions.
Tonka Canada Inc. - A Proper Plaintiff?
[3]
Section 50(4) of the Trade Marks Act provides:
"Subject to any agreement subsisting between the parties thereto, a registered user of a trademark may call on the owner thereof to take proceedings for infringement thereof, and, if the owner refuses or neglects to do so within two months after being so called on, the registered user may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as if he were the owner, making the owner a defendant, but an owner so added as defendant is not liable for any costs unless he takes part in the proceedings."
"Sous réserve de tout accord subsistant entre les parties, un usager inscrit d'une marque de commerce peut requérir le propriétaire d'intenter des procédures pour usurpation de la marque et, si le propriétaire refuse ou néglige de le faire dans les deux mois qui suivent cette réquisition, l'usager inscrit peut intenter ces procédures en son propre nom comme s'il était le propriétaire, en faisant du propriétaire un défendeur. Toutefois, un propriétaire ainsi adjoint comme défendeur n'est responsable d'aucuns frais à moins qu'il ne participe aux procédures."
[4]
I do not read s. 50(4) as setting out an exhaustive description of the circumstances in which a registered user may commence an action for trademark infringement. In my view s. 50(4) is ancillary to the right of a licensed user to commence an action on its own should it wish to do so. Section 50(4) provides that a licensed user
may
call on an owner to commence an action and if the owner does not,
may
add the owner as a
defendant
. But the section does not say that this is the only remedy open to a licensed user. The provision does not say that a licensed user may only commence action on its own after it has first sought to have the owner commence the action and the owner has refused.
[5]
On reading the Trade Marks Act as a whole, one finds that it is remarkably silent as to who can sue and under what circumstances. Section 57(1) provides that "any person interested" can seek expungement. A "person interested" is defined as including:
"any person who is affected or reasonably apprehends that he may be affected by any act or omission or contemplated act or omission ... contrary to this Act."
[6]
Apart from this provision, however, there is no
express
provision according even the trademark owner the right to commence an action. The text of the Act clearly leaves that right to be implied from the terms of the Act; terms which, for example, given the trademark owner the right to the exclusive use of the mark. In my view, the right of a registered user to commence an action is equally implicit. This flows from provisions such as ss. 50(1)-(3) in an analogous fashion to the implicit right to sue which flows from the owner's exclusive right to use the mark.
[7]
The decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is of no assistance to the defendants. That case dealt with s. 32 of the Patent Act which at the time provided:
"Every person who, without the consent in writing of the patentee, makes, constructs or puts in practice any invention for which a patent has been obtained under this Act or any previous Act, or who procures such invention from any person not authorized by the patentee or his legal representatives to make or use it, and who uses it,
shall be liable to the patentee or his legal representatives in an action of damages
for so doing; and the judgment shall be enforced, and the damages and costs that are adjudged shall be recoverable, in like manner as in other cases in the court in which the action is brought."
The would be plaintiff, in that case, was neither the patentee nor his legal representative and thus was held not to be properly added as a plaintiff. There is no such provision respecting the civil liability of trademark infringers, in the Trade Marks Act.
Sufficiency Of Pleadings, Re: Passing Off
[8]
Insofar as paragraphs 13(a) and 13(b) of the statement of claim are concerned, I am not convinced that they constitute pleadings which offend rule 408 of the Federal Court Rules. Paragraphs 13(a) and 13(b) must be read within the context of the statement of claim as a whole. Those two subsections are preceeded by the statement:
"The defendants, and each of them,
by their activities aforesaid
have:
(a) ...
(b) ..."
Thus, allegations of fact which have been made elsewhere in the Statement of Claim are incorporated by reference into paragraph 13. Those allegations of fact are clear and precise. It is, of course, open to the defendants to seek more detail through a request for particulars should they so wish.
[9]
The defendants' motion will be dismissed.
Motion dismissed.
