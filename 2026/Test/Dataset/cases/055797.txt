Reasons For Order
[1]
Reed, J.
: The applicant seeks to have a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board ("the Board") set aside. Two grounds for this challenge are asserted: the Board's decision that the applicant was not a credible witness is based on misconstructions of the evidence, disregard of the evidence and improper inferences; the Board did not properly consider the law and the facts relating to the internal flight alternative.
[2]
Both parties agree that the Board erred in making its assessment of an internal flight alternative. Thus the only issue before me is whether the finding of credibility should be set aside.
[3]
Counsel for the applicant indicated that he perceived some variation between the decisions of the Trial Division and those of the Appeal Division of this court with respect to the kind of circumstances under which evidenciary findings or conclusions drawn therefrom by a Board will be set aside. It was suggested to me that the Trial Division is applying a much higher standard than that applied by the Appeal Division. It was suggested that the Trial Division is requiring that the findings on the evidence be "perverse" before they can be successfully challenged while the Court of Appeal applies a much lower threshold. Reference was made, for example, to the recent decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), where Mr. Justice MacGuigan stated:
"The Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the 'Board') chose to base its finding of lack of credibility here for the most part, not on internal contradictions, inconsistencies, and evasions, which is the heartland of the discretion of triers of fact, but rather on the implausibility of the claimant's account in the light of extrinsic criteria such as rationality, common sense, and judicial knowledge, all of which involve the drawing of inferences, which triers of fact are in little, if any, better position than others to draw."
[4]
The decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), was also quoted:
"In many cases, this among them, the claimant's evidence has been given through interpreters, usually different at each proceeding. The process is fraught with the possibility of innocent misunderstanding.
"These views were echoed by Mr. Justice Hugessen in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 169:
"I have mentioned the Board's zeal to find instances of contradiction in the applicant's testimony. While the Board's task is a difficult one, it should not be over-vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence of persons who, like the present applicant, testify through an interpreter and tell tales of horror in whose objective reality there is reason to believe."
[5]
I am not convinced that the test which the Trial Division has been applying is all that different from those found in the Court of Appeal decisions. The reference to perversity, I think arises as one example of the kind of circumstance in which a decision of a Board will be set aside. Section 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, states that:
"The Trial Division may grant relief ... if it is satisfied that the federal board ... based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner
or
without regard for the material before it."
I read that paragraph as setting out disjunctive conditions under which a decision will be set aside, of which perversity is only one.
[6]
As I understand counsel's argument, he was suggesting that findings of fact were reviewable under two paragraphs of s. 18.1(4), paragraphs (d) and (c). Paragraph (c) provides that relief may be granted when a board:
"erred in law in making a decision or an order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record."
As I understand counsel's argument, it is that if paragraph (d) does not allow the court to review Board decisions for unreasonableness, paragraph (c) does.
[7]
I understand both the provisions in question to be statutory codifications of the common law principles of judicial review. As I understand those principles, courts have long been prepared to characterize findings of fact which are unsupported by adequate evidence as errors of law:
"A tribunal which has made a finding of primarily fact wholly unsupported by evidence, or which has drawn an inference wholly unsupported by any of the primary facts found by it, will be held to have erred in point of law." S.A. de Smith,
Judicial Review of Administrative Act
(4th Ed. 1980), at p. 133
[8]
This so-called "no evidence" situation is clearly one which the courts have characterized as an error of law. There has been I think more debate as to whether decisions could be set aside as an error of law on the ground that they were unreasonable. Section 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Court Act
, however, allows the court to set aside a decision which is made by a tribunal "without regard for the material before it". This in my view grants a broader right of review than the traditional "no evidence" test. I think the wording in paragraph (d) encompass the setting aside of tribunal decisions when they are unreasonable. Counsel cited many cases of our court, both the Appeal Division and Trial Division. I frankly do not have time to consider them all if a decision in this case is to be made expeditiously. At the same time, I am aware of a review of the scope of the phrase "perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it", in J.A. Kavanagh,
A Guide to Judicial Review
(1978) at pp. 57-58 (see also
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). That text is now somewhat dated but I do not think it is inaccurate:
"In practice, the test applied by the Federal Court to findings of fact seems to be whether on the whole of the evidence, the finding of fact was one that a reasonable person acting judicially could make: [citations omitted]
. . . . .
"This is basically the same test that is used by appellate courts. If an Appeal Court cannot come to the conclusion that the trial judge, with the advantage of having heard and tried the case, was plainly wrong in his findings of fact, it will defer to his judgment. The credibility, trustworthiness and cogency of evidence are all best left to the tribunal to determine: [citations omitted]
. . . . .
"Technical findings of fact in particular are thought to be best left undisturbed because they are usually made by a specialized tribunal with background knowledge not available to the court:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 342 and 345 (Fed. C.A.) (whether a power unit was within the relatively new class of machine called a chainsaw was a matter with respect to which the court would need very complete evidence before second guessing the tribunal)."
[9]
Thus, I have no doubt that the proper test for setting aside Board decisions on the basis of erroneous findings of fact is to ask whether they are unreasonable on the basis of all the evidence. What are characterized as findings of fact can of course be divided into two classifications: findings of primary fact (e.g. whether a physical phenomenon occurred) and inferences of fact which are drawn from the primary facts. Courts are reluctant to interfere with findings of primary facts made by tribunals, as are courts of appeal with those of a trial judge. The readiness to review the inferences which are drawn from primary facts is however another matter. In areas where a tribunal has particular expertise or experience in drawing the kinds of inferences which need to be drawn for the making of the decision courts are inclined to treat those inferences with deference. If however the inference is of a type which is based on the common experience of mankind, then, the court, as Mr. Justice MacGuigan said in
Soto Giron
, is in as equally good a position to make it as the tribunal. In that case deference is often not shown. (I owe much of this analysis to de Smith (supra) at pp. 126-139)
[10]
While I accept counsel's argument that when determining refugee status, the Immigration and Refugee Board is not given a discretion but must make a judicial type decision, the court is unlikely to be quick to interfere with decisions regarding the existence or not of primary facts or with inferences drawn by the Board which are particularly within its area of expertise and experience unless it is clear that they are not supported by the evidence.
[11]
In this case there are a large number of findings or inferences drawn by the Board which do not stand up on a review of the evidence. I will refer to some of them.
[12]
The Board's first credibility finding reads as follows:
"When his counsel asked him where these Sikhs moved to, the claimant answered that some cut their hair, but that he did not like that idea, and that Sikhs have to keep their hairstyle. The panel did not consider this to be a satisfactory answer to the question."
[13]
The evidence in question reads:
"Counsel: My question is that if it was a safe village, why would other Sikhs leaving one by one [sic]?
Claimant: It is quite a fear in their mind because of those happenings and if it can happen in the cities, same thing will happen in the villages too.
Counsel: Do you have any idea where they moved to?
Claimant: I don't know about this; I think it's the one's own individual thing.
Counsel: What were you -- sorry; go ahead.
Claimant: Some people moved out by cutting their hair and I didn't like that idea.
Counsel: What would happen if you say some people cut their hair; what -- how would it change the situation?
Claimant: It is entirely in the hands of the government.
Counsel: I think my question was that if a Sikh cuts hir [sic] hair, what difference it would make to that person to continue to live in his place, in Haryana.
Claimant: To keep the Sikh religion, one has to keep those [sic] hair as symbols."
[14]
The Board made the following finding:
"When his counsel asked him if he could not have moved to a safer place in Karnal, the claimant answered that he had his business there. The panel also did not find this to be a satisfactory answer."
[15]
In his evidence, the applicant did not state that he did not move to a safer place in Karnal because he had his business there. The applicant stated that he was living in the Karnal area and would flee to the Punjab and return to Karnal. He did state that he had his business there, but the business was not connected to his decision to move or not to move, as suggested by the panel. When specifically asked by counsel as to whether or not there was any other part of the Haryana district that he could move to, the applicant stated that there was no part of Haryana that could be safe in, because he was a Sikh.
[16]
The Board went on to find as follows:
"Shiv Sena appears to be a terrorist Hindu organizations, using intimidation, extortion and death threats, according to the unsigned letters, allegedly sent to the male claimant. When his counsel asked him if he suffered at the hands of any people other than Shiv Sena, the claimant answered with: yes, they are all Hindus. However, the claimant also stated that it was hard to say, because they are mostly clean shaven. From this the panel concludes that the claimant is not sure whether he suffered at the hands of any people other than Shiv Sena. The panel considers this to be an inconsistency in his testimony."
[17]
There is no inconsistency in the applicant's evidence in this regard. When questioned about the problems that he had with the Shiv Sena, the applicant testified that although he believed that all of the people were members of the Shiv Sena, he could not be absolutely sure because they were clean shaven. This evidence was not inconsistent with any other evidence. There was no inconsistency here but rather an uncertainty on the part of the applicant with respect to who his tormentors were.
[18]
The panel found that the applicant was inconsistent in his evidence because at one point he stated that he did not go to the police, but then later on stated that he did go to the police. Again the tribunal's summation is not correct. The applicant's evidence was that if he went to the police, they would not assist him. When asked specifically if he had gone to the police, he answered that after his first letter, he did go to the police but that they did not assist him; as a result, after the second letter, he did not bother going to the police.
[19]
The Board drew an adverse inference from the fact that the applicant had not mentioned two letters in his PIF which he mentioned in his oral testimony. It drew an adverse inference from the fact that his wife went to Canada and then returned to India. It drew an adverse inference from the fact that he did not know the expiry date of his visitors visa. The Board stated: "The Panel finds it inconceivable that the claimant was not aware of that date".
[20]
It is difficult to understand why the Board drew adverse inferences from these facts. The PIF is supposed to be a brief recitation of the applicant's claim, not a documentation of his whole case. There was no evidence that it was unsafe for his wife to return to India, or even to the area from which the appellant alleged he was fleeing. Also, why is it inconceivable that the applicant would not know the expiry date of his visitor's visa?
[21]
It may be that these last inferences are ones made by the Board because of special expertise and experience but they look like the kind of inferences which are based on general knowledge and experience.
[22]
I have only referred to some of the aspects of the Board's decision which are not soundly based on the evidence. I have also not cited several findings which do seem somewhat solidly based. The question becomes whether this is the kind of a decision which should be sent back for rehearing or about which one can say that there remains enough, that is not challengeable, to support the Board's decision. The court does not have authority to substitute its decision for the Board's the way an Appeal Court may with respect to a decision of a trial judge.
[23]
In any event, applying the above described test, I have decided that because there are such a large number of misconstructions and inferences which are not obvious from the evidence that the whole decision is tainted.
[24]
I have decided, on reading the Board's decision in the context of the evidence as a whole, to set the decision aside and to refer it back for reconsideration.
Application allowed.
