Reed, J.
: On December 4, 1992, I issued an order dismissing the applicants' application for leave to commence a s. 18.1 proceeding under the
Federal Court Act
. The application sought to have a decision of an immigration officer which had found that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to recommend that the applicants be granted landing from within Canada reviewed and set aside. I gave no reasons for my decision.
[2]
On January 14, 1993, a letter was received from counsel for the applicants noting that no reasons had been given and stating that "it is only fair and just that the applicants be satisfied as to why their application was denied". While there is of course no obligation on a judge to give reasons and since we are routinely expected to deal with approximately 100 leave applications a week, there is no time to do so. Nevertheless, I have decided, in this instance, to respond to counsel's request.
[3]
The application for leave and related materials, as I read them, raised four grounds as reasons for granting leave: (1) the Governor-in-Council is the body authorized by s. 114(2) of the
Immigration Act
to decide whether or not humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist - thus the Immigration Officer's decision is ultra vires and of no effect since that decision constituted the exercise of an unauthorized subdelegation of authority; (2) the decision was contrary to s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
because there was a long delay between the time when the applicants first came to this country and when their application was eventually dealt with (concomitantly the applicants had been interviewed with respect to possible humanitarian and compassionate grounds on May 9, 1990 but not notified of the decision until April 24, 1992); (3) the immigration officer was biased in making her assessment and failed to properly address her mind to the issues and the law; (4) the respondent's representations should not be taken into account because they were filed late.
[4]
I dismissed the applicants' application because I did not think there was a seriously arguable issue of law raised.
Unauthorized Subdelegation
[5]
With respect to the unauthorized sub-delegation, in the first place, it must be noted that s. 114(2) does not require the Governor-in-Council to make any decision, it simply provides:
"114(2) The Governor-in-Council may by regulations exempt any person from any regulation made under subs. (1) or otherwise facilitate the admission of any person where the Governor-in-Council is satisfied that the person should be exempted from that regulation or the person's admission should be facilitated for reasons of public policy or due to the existence of compassionate or humanitarian considerations."
[6]
The appropriate procedure to be followed under s. 114(2) was discussed by Mr. Justice LeDain  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -Perez and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at pp. 170-171:
"The
Act
does not indicate how the request for exemption from the requirement of s. 9 is to be applied for, nor is there anything in the record that throws light on the departmental practice in this regard, but in my opinion the request is properly made, as a practical matter, to the local immigration officials who may be expected to refer it to the Minister with their recommendation. Such a request falls within the general administration of the
Act
and, in the absence of special provision, administrative fairness requires that it be capable of being made at the local departmental level. The letters dated June 24 and 30, 1980 addressed to the appellant Boisvert, from which I have quoted above, expressed a sufficiently clear request for exemption on compassionate or humanitarian grounds from the requirement of s. 9.
"Counsel for the Crown took the position, as I understood his argument, that there had not been a proper request for exemption, the implication being that such a request must be addressed in some other manner directly to the Governor-in-Council, and that in any event there could not be duty to permit an application for landing to be made from within Canada unless and until such an exemption had been obtained. As I have indicated, I am of the opinion that administrative fairness requires that a request for exemption from the requirement of s. 9 be processed by the local immigration officials. ...
. . . . .
"For the reasons I would dismiss the appeal but I would vary the order of the Trial Division by substituting for the words 'that they determine whether, in this case, the evidence discloses compassionate and humanitarian considerations that could possibly justify granting landing to him by way of special relief' the words 'that they take the necessary steps to enable the Governor-in-Council to determine whether special relief on compassionate or humanitarian grounds from the requirement of s. 9 of the
Act
should be granted'."
[7]
This decision was affirmed but varied by the Supreme Court, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 565; 56 N.R. 215. The order issued by the Federal Court of Appeal read:
"that they take the necessary steps to enable the Governor-in-Council to determine whether special relief on compassionate or humanitarian grounds from the requirement of s. 9 of the
Act
should be granted."
The Supreme Court amended this to read:
"It is declared that the appellants Jean Boisvert and Susan Lawson are under a duty to consider respondents' application for an exemption on compassionate and humanitarian grounds of the requirement of s. 9 of the
Immigration Act
, 1976
,
to deal with it in the name of the Minister of Employment and Immigration and to advise respondents of the result
." (Underlining added)
[8]
Marrocco and Goslett in their text entitled
1993 Immigration Act of Canada
, describe the effect of the
Jiminez-Perez
decision of the Supreme Court:
"The Minister of Employment and Immigration
through his officers
is under a duty to consider applications for exemption on compassionate or humanitarian grounds from the requirement of s. 9 of the
Immigration Act
and to advise the applicants of the results of their application. The application for landing from within Canada should be considered and adjudicated upon if and when the exemption sought from s. 9(1) is granted. That application would be subject to whatever rights of appeal are granted by the
Immigration Act
." (Underlining added)
[9]
The respondent in his memorandum of argument in response to that filed by counsel for the applicants specifically drew this jurisprudence to the applicants' attention.
[10]
In addition, it is to be noted that in
Vidal and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 123 (F.C.T.D.), Mr. Justice Strayer stated, at page 128:
"There are a few basic propositions which are, in my view, self-evident and which should be kept in mind in dealing with these issues.
(1) In s. 114(2) Parliament has authorized the Governor-in-Council to make exceptions to the rules found in the
Act
and in the
Regulations
. There is therefore nothing inconsistent with the
Act
in the Governor-in-Council creating such exceptions by regulation.
(2) The exceptions so made are for the benefit of those in whose favour they are made and do not detract from the normal application of the general rules to all others. Those who complain that they have not been made the beneficiary of a regulation adopted under s. 114(2) are in effect complaining that they have not received a special benefit.
(3) The discretion conferred under s. 114(2) is conferred on the Governor-in-Council, not on the immigration officer who conducts the interview. The latter reports to the Minister with a recommendation. By normal processes of cabinet government the Minister of Employment and Immigration in turn would review the report and recommendation and, if in agreement, make a recommendation to the Governor-in-Council for the exercise of his discretion under s. 114(2)." (Footnotes omitted)
[11]
Counsel in the
Vidal
case raised an argument that the Governor-in-Council alone should hear applications for humanitarian and compassionate exemptions under s. 114(2). Mr. Justice Strayer wrote at pages 142-143:
"One of the surprising contentions of Ms. Jackman, on behalf of the applicants, was that the Governor-in-Council himself should hear all such applications for favourable treatment under s. 114(2). That this is completely impossible is well demonstrated by the evidence, which shows that in a period from the summer of 1989 to October 26, 1990 there were some 39,879 such reviews on humanitarian and compassionate grounds alone. Recognizing that a small percentage of those reviews were duplications after the
Yhap
decision, which arguably would not have been necessary had the Governor-in-Council been conducting all such reviews, it is inconceivable that Parliament intended the Governor-in-Council to focus on each application. An extensive delegation system must be implied.
"I believe that the role of the Minister and her guidelines is also consistent with the intention of Parliament in this respect. It is accepted practice that, when an Act contains a provision for the making of delegated legislation such as s. 114(2), the Minister designated as responsible for that Act is responsible for bringing forward any recommendations to the Governor-in-Council for the exercise of that power. The Minister of Employment and Immigration is designated as the Minister for the purposes of this Act. But the nature of the problem is such, given the vast number of applicants for special treatment under s. 114(2) and their geographic dispersal, that the Minister must rely on her immigration officers to study the applications, interview the applicants, and make recommendations to the Minister as to which case she should recommend to the Governor-in-Council for favourable treatment. As I have indicated earlier, it is not only permissible but highly desirable that the Minister try to assure that there is some consistency of treatment of these applications by those at the operating level, and this she has done by the issue of guidelines. It is accepted that those guidelines may not fetter the discretion of immigration officers to consider any factor which could arguably be embraced by the terms 'humanitarian and compassionate', but it is quite in order for the Minister on behalf of the Governor-in-Council to indicate definitively to immigration officers what elements of public policy she is prepared to recommend to the Governor-in-Council as a basis for favourable action. It is surely within the expectation of Parliament and of most Canadians that the Minister will try to ensure that the discretionary powers granted by s. 114(2) are exercised with some coherence and consistency and that in such matters of public policy Parliament can rightly look to the Governor-in-Council and the Minister to be responsible for the content of that policy."
[12]
With respect to the issue of the authority of a departmental official to make a decision on behalf of the responsible minister, John Willis, in a well known and basic article entitled "
Delegatus Non Potest Delegare
(1943), 21 Cdn. Bar Rev. 257, notes at page 260:
"... however, the courts will readily mould the literal words of a statute to such construction as will best achieve its object; because they will, recognizing the facts of modern government, readily imply in an authority such powers as it would normally be expected to possess; because of the presumption of deliberate selection, strong when applied to the case of a principal who appoints an agent or a testator who selects a trustee, wears thin when applied to a statute which authorizes some governmental authority, sometimes with a fictitious name such as 'Governor-in-Council' or 'Minister of Justice', to exercise a discretion which everyone, even the legislature, knows will in fact be exercised by an unknown underling in the employ of the authority, the prima facie rule of delegatus non potest delegare will readily give way, like the principles on which it rests, to slight indications of contrary intent."
And at page 264:
"As in all cases where the decision turns on a court's estimate of the comparative value of two conflicting policies it is not easy to predict what a court will do with the instant case, but it is worth remarking that in their application of the maxim delegatus non potest delegare to modern governmental agencies the courts have in most cases preferred to depart from the literal construction of the words of the statute which would require them to read in the word 'personally' and to adopt such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern government which, being carried on in theory by elected representatives but in practice by civil servants or local government officers, undoubtedly requires them to read in the words 'or any person authorized by it'."
[13]
Lord Greene, M.R., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  government in this country the functions which are given to Ministers ... are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them ... It cannot be supposed that the regulation meant that, in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case.
Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister
..." (Underlining added) <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> was approved in the Supreme Court of Canada by Mr. Justice Dickson in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 245.
[14]
The following is from de Smith's
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(4th Ed.), by J.M. Evans (Stevens & Sons, London, 1980) at page 307:
"Special considerations arise where a statutory power vested in a Minister or a department of State is exercised by a departmental official. The official is the alter ego of the Minister or the department, and since he is subject to the fullest control by his superior he is not usually spoken of as a delegate. (A different analysis must, of course, be adopted where powers are explicitly conferred upon or delegated to an official by a law-making instrument.) The courts have recognized that 'the duties imposed on Ministers and the powers given to Ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the Ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. In general, therefore, a Minister is not obliged to bring his own mind to bear upon a matter entrusted to him by statute but may act through a dutl authorized officer of his department."
[15]
I should also note that insofar as the role of the Governor-in-Council is concerned s. 35(1) of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 defines "Governor-in-Council" as follows:
"'Governor-in-Council' or 'Governor-in-Council' means the Governor General of Canada acting by and with the advice of, or by and with the advice and consent of, or in conjunction with the Queen's Privy Council for Canada."
And, the following is taken from J.R. Mallory's book
The Structure of Canadian Government
, Revised Edition (Gage Publishing Limited, Toronto, 1984), at pages 68-69:
"It is important to distinguish between the Privy Council and the Governor-in-Council. The Privy Council as such has no constitutional function to perform, since it is a body 'to aid and advise' the formal heal of the government, the Governor General. The powers of government are conferred, by law and practice, on the Governor-in-Council."
And at page 74:
"What is the relationship of the Governor-in-Council as a formal body to the actual process of government decision-making? In essence, formal actions which require to be actions of the Governor-in-Council are dealt with by ministers acting as committees of the Privy Council, and the draft minutes or orders are then transmitted to the Governor General for him to signify his approval in his office."
[16]
An example of a provision which required that the Governor-in-Council must itself make the decision (although on recommendation from the responsible minister) is s. 12(1) of the old
Foreign Investment Review Act
, S.C. 1973-74, c. 46 (repealed S.C. 1985, c. 20, s. 46). That section provided:
"12(1) On receipt by the Governor-in-Council of a recommendation or submission by the Minister with respect to an investment,
the Governor-in-Council shall consider
the recommendation and the summary submitted in connection therewith or the submission, as the case may be, and where, having regard to the factors enumerated in subs. 2(2), he concludes that the investment is or is likely to be of significant benefit to Canada, he shall, by order, allow the investment but where he does not reach that conclusion, he shall, by order, refuse to allow the investment." (Underlining added)
Section 114(2) of the
Immigration Act
is not of this nature. There can be no argument that any unauthorized subdelegation occurred.
Time For Filing Written
Representations
[17]
In the course of submitting this matter for consideration, counsel for the applicants raised an argument that the respondent's written representations should be struck out as having been filed beyond the time allowed pursuant to s. 17(2) of the
Federal Court Immigration Rules
. Section 17 of the
Immigration Rules
, SOR/91-698; 28 November 1991, reads as follows:
"17(1) A respondent who opposes an application for leave may file one or more affidavits and written representations.
"17(2) Where the respondent files affidavits and written representations, they shall be filed and served not later than 20 clear days after the day on which the applicant served the respondent with the application for leave, affidavits or written representations, whichever is the latest."
[18]
The applicants' written representations were filed and served on June 4, 1992. The respondent's written representations were filed and served on June 25, 1992.
[19]
Section 17(2) prescribes "20 clear days". According to s. 27(1) of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, this means that neither June 4 nor June 25 is to be counted in the calculation of the time period. Section 27(1) reads as follows:
"27(1) Where there is a reference to a number of 'clear' days or 'at least' a number of days between two events, in calculating that number of days the days on which the events happen are excluded."
Therefore, there being exactly 20 clear days between the filing of the parties' written submissions, the respondent's written representations were filed within the time allowed under s. 17(1) of the
Immigration Rules
.
Delay - Charter Rights
[20]
With respect to the applicants' argument that the delay in dealing with the applicants' claim for refugee status constitutes a breach of s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, this issue has been dealt with in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[21]
While the court in those cases, did not rule out the possibility that an argument based on undue delay might cause a breach of s. 7, it was stated that the applicant had to demonstrate both that prejudice had arisen to the applicant as a result of the delay and that the delay was unreasonable. In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, the applicant had waited between two and three years. In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, the applicant had waited two years between a first and second inquiry concerning the applicant's right to remain in the country. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Court of Appeal stated:
"Since in my view one cannot draw a proper analogy in law between the position of the applicants and persons charged with offenses, any claims to
Charter
breach based on delay must depend on a showing of prejudice by the claimant: that the delay was, for a person in his situation, unreasonable. This is the second obstacle faced by these applicants for it is my further view that there is nothing in the circumstances or in the evidence in the present cases to support their claims.
"To put the matter another way, a delayed hearing for the resolution of a claim to refugee status is not necessarily an unfair or an unjust one for the claimant. While it is the case that each of the present applicants would probably have passed the credible basis test had his hearing been held shortly after his arrival (and the Tribunal so indicated in each case) that has no impact on the justice of the matter. The purpose of the refugee system both in international and domestic law is not to provide an easy means for immigrants to find a new and more desirable country of residence; it is to furnish a safe heaven to those who rightly fear they will be persecuted in their country of origin. Thus, if as was found to be the case here, the situation in the applicants' country of origin has now returned to one where it is no longer reasonable to fear persecution, the applicants can have no complaints of unjust treatment if their claims to refugee status are denied. ..."
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the court stated:
"In the case at bar ... no attempt was made to explain the two year delay before making a second request for an inquiry. Clearly at first sight it would seem to be so long as to be unreasonable. However, the
Immigration Act, 1976
mentions no peremptory duty to act within a particular time. Section 27 imposes on an immigration officer the duty to submit such a report if he is in possession of information specified in the section. It would undoubtedly have been desirable for the government to have acted earlier, but there was no requirement for it to do so, and it is difficult to conclude that the delay was so unreasonable to constitute an injustice to the applicant who in any case suffered no prejudice in the meanwhile.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Hugessen, J., of the Federal Court of Appeal responded as follows (at pp. 1028-1029 F.C., at p. 243 N.R.) to an applicant complaining that the government had delayed for two years in acting on his application in an immigration matter:
'It may well be that the recently discovered administrative duty to act fairly encompasses a duty not unreasonably to delay to act; or, put positively, that the procedural duty to act fairly includes a duty to proceed within a reasonable time. It does not by any means follow, however, that the breach of such a duty would give rise to the setting aside of the tardy action when it is finally taken. The remedy surely is to compel timely action rather than to annul one that, though untimely, may otherwise be correct.'"
[22]
In the present case there is not a scintilla of evidence which suggests that the applicants were prejudiced by the delay. The applicant, Rishee Maraj, arrived in Canada from Trinidad on January 28, 1988. His wife, Dhanmattee Poyah, arrived on March 25, 1988. On May 8, 1988, they both made a claim for Convention refugee status. Both obtained work permits and commenced working here. A son was born to them on August 26, 1988. On May 9, 1990, the applicants were interviewed by an immigration officer to determine whether there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to justify allowing them to apply for landed immigrant status from within the country. A second son was born to the applicants on July 13, 1990, Rishee Maraj's affidavit states:
"We continued to work, settle down and make ourselves a comfortable home."
[23]
Thus, during the period of delay, the applicants worked in this country and made themselves a comfortable home. They were not confined during the period of delay, for example, in a detention facility and, if anything, the delay assisted them in that they were able to remain in Canada for an additional two years beyond that which might otherwise have been the case. One can appreciate their desire to stay in this country but if the doing so constitutes prejudice, it is one they could have alleviated at any time by returning home to Trinidad.
Delayed Notification - Bias - No
Notice Of What Constitutes
Humanitarian And Compassionate
Grounds
[24]
The applicants argue that the rules of natural justice were not met because (1) they did not receive notice of the immigration officers negative decision until almost two years after it had been made; (2) the immigration officer who made the decision was biased; (3) the applicants were not given notice of what constituted, in the Minister's view, humanitarian and compassionate grounds before being interviewed.
[25]
The affidavit of Rishee Maraj states:
"... The Officer asked us a lot of personal information pertaining to ourselves and family relatives. The Officer did not explain to us or inform us in any way as to the meaning of 'humanitarian and compassionate grounds' or by what principles or law she would be guided in making her determination, nor did she explain to us what facts or information would form the basis of or constitute 'humanitarian and compassionate grounds' for the purpose of the interview. In fact, the Officer was not interested in the reasons why we made the refugee claim, saying that they would be dealt with at another hearing. This gave me the impression and I verily believe that she had already made up her mind and that her decision was predetermined. In any case, she told us that she would let us know within three weeks of her decision. We did not get the decision as promised. ..."
[26]
On March 27, 1992, the applicants received a notice that they were to appear for an immigration inquiry on April 24, 1992. At that enquiry, Rishee Maraj asked about the outcome of the applicants' claim to stay in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. His affidavit reads:
"12. At the inquiry on April 24, 1992, I enquired about the decision in connection with the humanitarian and compassionate interview which took place on May 9, 1990. The Adjudicator told us that he was not concerned about that, but the Case Presenting Officer Linda Heathfield told us that it was decided that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds. When I informed her that we did not get a decision, she was astonished. The Adjudicator then adjourned the inquiry. I then asked the Case Presenting Officer about why we were not informed of the decision on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; she looked a bit irritable and angry and went into the office, asking us to wait. She returned a few minutes later and gave us a letter dated April 24, 1992, referring to the interview of May 9, 1990 and informing us that the decision on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was against us. The letter, a normal form letter, also informed us of the inquiry date of April 24, 1992. Case Presenting Officer Linda Heathfield told us that the person who made the decision was one Nimrut Vanier and when I informed her that Nimrut Vanier was not the one who interviewed us, she argumentatively insisted that all she knew was that Nimrut Vanier was the one who made the decision. A copy of the said letter is hereto attached as 'Exhibit A'.
"13. I am advised and verily believe that our interview of May 9, 1990 was conducted in a manner contrary to the principles of natural justice.
"14. I am advised and verily believe that the Immigration Officer who interviewed us did not apply her mind to the principles contemplated by the
Immigration Act
in determining what constitutes the sufficiency of humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
"15. I am advised and verily believe that the said Immigration Officer who interviewed me on May 9, 1990 improperly, arbitrarily and illegally exercised her discretion.
"16. I am advised and verily believe that the purported decision of Nimrut Vanier is null and void and of no effect.
"17. I make this affidavit on behalf of myself and on behalf of my wife, Dhanmattee Poyah."
[27]
With respect to the delay in being notified of the immigration officer's decision, this is a two-edged argument. While the delay was unfortunate, there is also no evidence that the applicants sought to ascertain the nature of that decision during the whole period of time in question. In those circumstances I do not think the applicants can rely on the delay as a factor demonstrating bias or a lack of fairness.
[28]
With respect to the allegation that the decision-maker was biased there is not a shred of evidence on the file to support this allegation. Counsel for the applicants refers to the fact that the immigration officer did not inform the applicants ahead of time as to what constituted in the Minister's view humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The description of the applicable law found in the respondent's memorandum is apposite. An immigration officer in making a humanitarian and compassionate assessment is an administrative decision-maker and required to comply with the duty of fairness. This imposes a number of obligations, such as giving the applicants an opportunity to make submissions and produce evidence. It does not encompass a requirement however that the immigration officer provide the applicants with a list of criteria which if met would permit them to be successful in their humanitarian and compassionate review. The decision being made is not of a judicial nature.
[29]
It is useful to quote from some of the jurisprudence to which counsel for the respondent referred in his memorandum as well as to additional cases.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) (F.C. T.D.), at pp. 405-406 D.L.R., pp. 85-86 F.T.R., the following was said:
"... Although s. 114(2) does not vest any rights in the applicant, it does create a duty of fairness in the Minister when exercising the discretionary power contained therein. The question to be determined here is what standard of fairness is to be applied in these circumstances.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 36 N.R. 91 (F.C.A.), the duty of fairness was determined to have been complied with, but only where it was clear that the appellant had been given ample opportunity to tell his side of the story. Therefore, while the requirements of the duty of fairness may vary in accordance with individual circumstances, it must include, as a minimum, that the applicant have some opportunity to state his case.
"The situation in the present case is strikingly similar to that in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applicant claimed status as a Convention refugee. The claim was rejected by the Immigration Commission, the Immigration Appeal Board and the Federal Court of Appeal. Mr. Sobrie then requested the Minister to reconsider his case, to which the Minister replied that his case had been reviewed, that he was not a Convention refugee and that no humanitarian and compassionate grounds had been identified to justify an exemption. The applicant never provided any detailed or substantive information concerning humanitarian or compassionate grounds, and sought appropriate relief under s. 18. See pp. 86 and 89:
'I am not satisfied that he has ever been given an opportunity to address the existence of humanitarian and compassionate grounds under s. 115(2) [now s. 114(2)]. The immigration officials have assumed, quite logically, that their extensive file on Mr. Sobrie provides all the information that could possibly be relevant to this determination. That assumption is not warranted and is not in accordance with the principles of fairness.
'Obviously, the purpose behind s. 115(2) of the
Act
is not merely to repeat the procedure of evaluating an immigrant on the usual grounds specific in the Act. The intention is to provide a fresh view of the immigrant's situation from a new perspective. It follows that for the Minister to fairly consider an application under this section, he must be able to direct his mind
to what the applicant feels are his humanitarian and compassionate circumstances
. These may have nothing to do with the facts contained in the file of his previous immigration proceedings.
. . . . .
'The section does not state that the Governor-in-Council is to consider only what the immigration officials think are humanitarian and compassionate grounds or only those grounds which are already contained in the applicant's file. If Parliament had intended to restrict the considerations under this section to such an extent, it could easily have done so.'
"I am not suggesting of course, that the applicant has a right to a full oral hearing. But the duty of fairness with which the respondent is charged in conducting its review of the discretionary criteria prescribed by c.IE 12.19 of the
Immigration Manual
, requires that the applicant be allowed to make submissions as to whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist, before such a determination is made by immigration officials.
"With respect to the failure to provide reasons, the applicant relies upon the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 14 C.R.R. 13 [and] ...
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ...
"I note that neither of these cases, however, suggests that the applicant's opportunity to know the case to be met can somehow imply a duty to provide written reasons. The decisions were made in one case by a visa officer and, in another, by a redetermination ..." (Underlining added)
[30]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  said:
"There is no doubt that we are faced in the case at bar with administrative procedures in which Parliament gave discretionary powers to the representatives of Canadian immigration.
"Since the decision of the Supreme Court in
Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it has been acknowledged that immigration officers are under a duty to consider the application of a person for exemption, for humanitarian or compassionate reasons, from the requirement of s. 9 of the
Immigration Act
, 1976
; the officers must also make a decision on such an application, on behalf of the Minister of Employment and Immigration, and advise the applicant of their decision. However, the court did not provide procedural guidelines for the performance of this duty; from all appearances, procedural fairness would have to be observed in this process.
"In the case at bar, the record indicates that the discretionary power was exercised by the immigration counsellor, but in a manner that was unfavourable to the applicant.
"In exercising its power of judicial review, the court must not enter into a consideration of the merits of the case or examine the reasons for the decision in a case in which, as in the case at bar, the immigration counsellor exercised the discretionary power provided in s. 115(2) of the Act; but it must examine the legal context in which the decision was made.
"Counsel for the applicant contended that the decision-making process followed by the respondents was contrary to the principles of fundamental justice. In support of this argument, he submitted that the applicant appeared before Pierre Vallée but that it was not he who made the decision, but rather Hélène Dormeau: and thus that the applicant did not have the opportunity to present her humanitarian reasons to the immigration officer's superiors. In the same vein, he contended that in the context of this investigation to determine the humanitarian reasons that would justify an application for exemption, the children should have been given the opportunity to be heard since their rights were also in jeopardy. Counsel also went so far as to argue that the rights of the children to liberty and security of the person, which are now guaranteed by the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, were in great danger if their mother were required to return to Greece to apply for permanent residence.
"Unfortunately, I do not share the reasoning of counsel for the applicant. First, there is nothing to suggest that in such a case the applicant was entitled to an oral hearing to set out her humanitarian reasons. It is true that on January 21, 1987, when she presented herself at the office of the immigration counsellor, the applicant submitted both an application for permanent residence and an application to vary her terms of admission. While the counsellor took the opportunity to take note of the applicant's humanitarian reasons, he was under no obligation to do so in the context of this hearing. On this point, it should be noted that on the two other occasions when the applicant was given the opportunity to set out her humanitarian reasons, in May and November 1987, she did so in writing and set out all the facts that she believed to be relevant, inter alia, the facts respecting her children; but there were no hearings. In short, while the immigration officer had an obligation to consider the application for exemption, he had no obligation to hold an inquiry on this point, or to give reasons for his decision."

The argument that the immigration officer must advise the applicants of what criteria must be met in order for them to be granted landing from within Canada, on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, misconceives the nature of that decision. The decision is a discretionary one. Officers are required to address their minds to the grounds put forward by the applicants, on which the applicants rely. There are post-
Yhap
guidelines which are made available to officers, as noted in
Vidal
, supra, but these are not exhaustive criteria. The decision-making process being a discretionary and open-ended one, designed to allow for a nonclosed catalogue of reasons on which a positive decision may be based, is not one with respect to which applicants can be given ahead of time a list of criteria describing the circumstances in which humanitarian and compassionate grounds are found to exist.

Lastly, with respect to the particular application in issue, there is not a scintilla of information on the record explaining why the applicants think humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist to justify the granting of landing from within Canada. There is no description of the factual basis which underpins their application for leave. The court, on judicial review, does not re-examine decisions on the merits, unless they have been made in a perverse manner and in way not supported by the evidence. At the same time, on a leave to appeal application, applicants are required to demonstrate that they have a reasonably arguable case. Such a determination involves at least some cursory glance at the substantive merits of the claim being asserted. When there is no information respecting the merits put forward, it is open to the court to conclude that granting leave would be in the end a futile gesture and a waste of both the court's time and resources as well as counsels. There is a public interest in the efficient use of such resources. As noted, there is
no explanation
in the material filed setting out on what basis the applicants are claiming that humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist.

There are the reasons why I did not grant leave.
Application dismissed.
