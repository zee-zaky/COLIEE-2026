I.
Introduction
[1]
Noël, J.
: This is an application by Jie Cao [the Applicant] for leave to commence an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] dated August 29, 2013, which held that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.
II.
Facts
[2]
The Applicant is a citizen of Tianjin City [Ti anjin], People's Republic of China [China].
[3]
The Applicant claimed to have been introduced to Christianity by a friend in October 2009 when he was invited to attend an underground Christian house. He was later baptised by a visiting pastor on June 20, 2010.
[4]
The Public Safety Bureau [PSB] is said to have raided the underground church service on November 21, 2010. The Applicant went into hiding at a cousin's house. The Applicant claimed that the PSB was looking for him and that they went to his home and his brother's home looking for him. The Applicant further stated that the PSB went to his house on November 25, 2010, and left a summons for him to surrender. The Applicant therefore decided to find an agent to leave China before being discovered.
[5]
He arrived in Canada on February 25, 2011, and made a refugee claim. The RPD determined, on August 29, 2013, that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This is the decision under review.
III.
Impugned Decision
[6]
The identity of the Applicant is not of issue.
[7]
The RPD first stated that the credibility of the Applicant is undermined because of a lack of credible evidence provided regarding his reasons for wanting to travel to Brazil in 2007. The RPD also found that the credibility of the Applicant is damaged because he came out from hiding in order to get married on February 21, 2011, where he had to use his Resident Identity Card [RIC] number. By referring to country documents, the RPD explained that the PSB uses a database called Operation Golden Shield to track criminal fugitive in China using RIC numbers. The Applicant would therefore have been tracked by the PSB at that time. The RPD also found it implausible that the Applicant got married by the civil authorities on February 21, 2011, when he had been a fugitive since November 23, 2010. The RPD stated that approaching the civil authorities would have placed him at risk of detention. The RPD also found it implausible that the Applicant's agent bribed the exit control officer at the airport in order to leave China since this agent can easily be traced by the authorities.
[8]
The RPD further determined that the Applicant's knowledge of his church group was deficient and that the Applicant's baptism in Canada was only for show in order to add to his refugee claim. The Applicant's evidence is also contrary to the documentary evidence of the situation in Tianjin. The RPD thus concluded that the Applicant's testimony that the PSB raided his underground church, that the PSB detained several members of his church and that he is being pursued by the PSB not credible. The RPD also did not find the Applicant to be a genuine Christian. The RPD further concluded that the Applicant joined a Christian church in Canada to support his fraudulent refugee claim.
[9]
As for the situation of Christians in Tianjin, the RPD concluded, based on documentary evidence, that the authorities' response to underground church activities in this city is different than in other provinces within China, where, in other provinces, proselytizing is suppressed and arrests and incidents of persecution of ordinary Christians do happen. Tianjin, on the other hand, has one of the more liberal policies on religion in China. The RPD further wrote that the documentary evidence presented does not contain any mentions of recent arrests of lay Christians in Tianjin.
[10]
The RPD therefore determined that the Applicant was not a credible witness and was not sought after by the PSB based on his underground church activities in China. The RPD further stated that there is no serious possibility that the Applicant would be persecuted for practicing Christianity in China if he wished to do so.
IV.
Parties' Submissions
[11]
The Applicant submits that the RPD made unreasonable credibility findings based on speculation and a misapprehension of the documentary evidence, specifically with regards to the Applicant's travel plans to Brazil four years prior to his refugee claim and with regards to the use of his passport to leave China by bribing the exit control officer. The Applicant further argues that the RPD erred in its reliance on the Operation Golden Shield nation-wide system in China used to track individuals. The Respondent retorts by arguing that the RPD's finding regarding the Applicant's lack of credibility based on his attempt to leave China to be grounded in the evidence. The Respondent further submits that the Applicant misapprehended the evidence regarding Operation Golden Shield and that such a system exists nation-wide in China.
[12]
The Applicant also argues that the RPD made an unreasonable finding with regards to his documentary evidence, namely by not assessing the arrest summons left for him at his parents' home and simply declaring it fraudulent. The Respondent states, however, that the documentary evidence before the RPD explains that fraudulent documents are widely available in China. In light of this evidence and based on other credibility findings, the RPD's conclusion on this point is reasonable.
[13]
The Applicant further submits that the RPD failed to determine that the Applicant was a genuine Christian in Canada and at the time of the hearing. The RPD further failed to recognize that a prohibition against carrying out religious activities in public can constitute religious persecution. The Respondent is however of the opinion that it was reasonable for the RPD to evaluate the Applicant's religious practice in Canada in light of the finding that he was not a genuine Christian in China. Also, the RPD's conclusion that the evidence did not demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution of lay members of Christian house churches in Tianjin is reasonable.
V.
Issues
[14]
I have reviewed the parties' submissions and respective records and formulate the issues as follows:
1. Are the RPD's credibility findings reasonable?
2. Did the RPD make an unreasonable finding with respect to the Applicant's arrest summons?
3. Is the RPD's conclusion of the Applicant's religious identity reasonable?
4. Is the RPD's conclusion of the risk of religious persecution in Tianjin reasonable?
VI.
Standard of Review
[15]
The RPD's assessment of the Applicant's credibility is highly factual in nature (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Chen
]). This Court will therefore apply the reasonableness standard to the RPD's credibility determinations (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;
Chen
, above at para 14). The other three issues raised above are questions where the legal issues cannot be easily separated from the factual issues, the reasonableness standard therefore also applies (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Jing
]). This Court shall only intervene if it concludes that the decision is unreasonable and falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] SCJ No 9 at para 47).
VII.
Analysis
A.
Are the RPD's credibility findings reasonable?
[16]
The determination of the credibility of the Applicant is at the heart of the RPD's jurisdiction (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Credibility determinations by the RPD are therefore afforded deference (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). This Court will only intervene if the RPD "based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  116 FTR 310 at para 6 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 35; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 8).
[17]
In the case at bar, the Applicant's first argument concerns the RPD's negative credibility inference from his testimony regarding the visitor visa he obtained for Brazil in September 2007, about four years prior to his refugee claim. The Applicant argues that the RPD's reliance on this point was erroneous as this matter is peripheral to his refugee claim. I agree. It was improper for the RPD to derive a negative credibility inference on this matter, which was irrelevant and peripheral to his refugee claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 11). The RPD's conclusion of this point is thus unreasonable. That being said, this does not, on its own, render the entire decision unreasonable as it will be seen.
[18]
The Applicant, at the hearing, testified that one person had been arrested after the church raid. He claims that it is his wife who informed him of the arrest. He also testified that the arrested person was in fact his "introducer" to the underground church (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] pages 709-711). However, his Personal Information Form [PIF] states that "Till now, I still don't know who have been arrested" (Applicant's Record [AR] page 46 at para 12). It was reasonable for the RPD to draw a negative credibility inference from this contradiction.
[19]
Also, the Applicant's submission that the RPD based its decision on "speculation, impermissible inferences and a misappropriation of the documentary evidence before" is not persuasive. The RPD is indeed entitled to make determinations on common sense and rationality (
Jing
, above at para 15). The RPD's assessment of the Applicant's credibility, based on the use of his passport at the airport when leaving the country, his decision to come out of hiding to get married before the civil authorities using his RIC and the precautions (to have in order to ensure church activities) that the Applicant forgot to mention to the RPD but remembered when the RPD proposed them to him, is reasonable and supported by the documentary evidence contained in the Certified Tribunal Record. For example, the documentary evidence demonstrates that RICs are used to obtain a marriage license and contain information such as the card holder's name, date of birth, residential address, photo, gender, nationality, and more (CTR page 121). Moreover, the documentary evidence also demonstrates that the national computer network, referred to as Operation Golden Shield, used by the PSB is used to track, among other things, passport exit and entry (CTR page 140) (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [
Hao
]). The RPD's credibility determinations on these questions are thus reasonable.
B.
Did the RPD make an unreasonable finding with respect to the Applicant's arrest summons?
[20]
Contrary to the Applicant's argument, the RPD's decision that the arrest summons submitted by the Applicant is fraudulent and to afford it no weight is reasonable (
Jing
, above at para 17). The RPD considered the document and concluded that it is fraudulent based on the lack of credibility of the Applicant and on the evidence of the abundance of fraudulent documents in China (AR page 18 at paras 49-50). I further agree with the Respondent that the case law cited by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  does not help the Applicant's case. Indeed, in this decision, this Court determined that the RPD had not evaluated the evidence put forward by the Applicant and discounted other evidence submitted by the Applicant. This is not the case here. In the case at bar, the RPD assessed the documents presented by the Applicant, such as the arrest summons, and other documents, such as his baptismal certificate, church letter and photos (AR page 19 at paras 48-52). The RPD did not disregard the arrest summons, or any other document, but rather analysed them in the context of the Applicant's refugee claim. The intervention of this Court on this matter is not warranted.
C.
Is the RPD's conclusion of the Applicant's religious identity reasonable?
[21]
Again, I cannot agree with the Applicant that the RPD failed to perform an analysis of the Applicant's evidence regarding the genuineness of his faith and religious convictions. Contrary to the Applicant's position, the RPD did assess the letter from his pastor, his baptismal certificate and the photos submitted by the Applicant, as discussed above, in its decision (AR page 19 at paras 48-52). The RPD assessed the Applicant's religious identity based on the evidence and in light of its credibility determinations (
Jing
, above at paras 22-23;
Hao
, above at paras 17-18;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The RPD's analysis on this point is thus reasonable. The Applicant is simply asking this Court to reweigh the evidence, which is not its role.
D.
Is the RPD's conclusion of the risk of religious persecution in Tianjin reasonable?
[22]
I find that the RPD conducted a thorough analysis of the documentary evidence with regards to the situation of Christians in Tianjin, and did so in a forward-looking manner. The Applicant mainly takes issue with the RPD's conclusion on the situation of Christians in Tianjin. This, in and of itself, cannot render the RPD's decision unreasonable (
Jing
, above at para 27). The Applicant simply offers a different interpretation than the RPD did. Moreover, the RPD's analysis is based on its evaluation of various documentary evidence contained in the record; it did not ignore evidence nor did it misapprehended the evidence. Indeed, the RPD assessed the evidence by asking itself if there was a serious possibility that the Applicant would be persecuted for practicing Christianity in an unregistered church in Tianjin. The RPD completed this analysis independently of its previous findings regarding the Applicant (AR pages 20-26 at paras 59-76).
[23]
The Applicant also points to a 2010 China Aid Association's Annual Report [the Report] in its submissions to suggest that it is a reliable source of information on the persecution of house churches in China (AR page 155 at paras 42-44). This report specifically mentions Tianjin and that municipal authorities attempted to tear down Immanuel Church. The Applicant argues that the RPD attempted to disregard this incident, which renders the RPD's decision unreasonable. It so happens that the exact same argument, based on the exact same document was argued in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, Justice Russell explained, in its analysis of the document and the said event that:
[I]n the end, the Applicant can only point to the 2010 China Aid Report which mentions that in Tianjin some Korean Christians have been expelled, and that, in Jinghai County, authorities had attempted to tear down the meeting building of the Immanuel church. The full context of these events is not given, so that we have no explanation for why the authorities may have acted as they did and the significance of such action for general Christian practice in Tianjin. We also do not know whether these actions would amount to persecution in terms of Convention and Canadian refugee law. [...]
[24]
The same can be said here: the Applicant did not provide more information with regards to this event. After the evaluation of the above Report and other documentary evidence presented, the RPD wrote:
[T]he panel considered the documentary evidence about conditions in Tianjin and the claimant's personal circumstances. The panel finds, on balance of probabilities, that the claimant would be able to practice his alleged religion, worshipping in the Christian congregation of his choosing, if he were to return to his home in Tianjin in China, and that there is no serious possibility that he would be persecuted for doing so (AR page 29 at para 86).
The RPD also evaluated the situation of Christians in China in general and noted that the religious practice and tolerance varies widely within the country (AR pages 21-22 at paras 62-64).
[25]
Therefore, contrary to the Applicant's argument, the RPD did not unreasonably disregard this evidence. I cannot find any reviewable error with regards of the RPD's assessment of the situation of Christians in Tianjin. The RPD's conclusion on this point is reasonable, even more so in light of the reasonable conclusion that it did find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant did not attend the underground church in China and was not a practicing Christian (AR page 17 at para 44). The RPD thus considered the documentary evidence provided and reached reasonable conclusions on the situation of Christians in Tianjin.
VIII.
Conclusion
[26]
Except for the findings made as the result of the Applicant's Brazil visitor's visa of 2007, I find that all the other determinations made (such as the credibility findings made, the comments on the summons, the evaluation on the Applicant's religious identity and his risk of religious prosecution in Tianjin, etc.) render this decision reasonable.
[27]
Counsels were invited to submit questions but none were proposed.
JUDGMENT
[28]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. There is no serious question of general importance to be certified.

[Traduction]: M. Jie Cao [le demandeur] sollicite, sous le régime du paragraphe 72(1) de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], l'autorisation d'introduire une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision en date du 29 août 2013 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] a statué qu'il n'avait qualité ni de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni de personne à protéger aux termes respectifs des articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.
II.
Les faits
[2]
Le demandeur est citoyen de Tianjin, en République populaire de Chine [la Chine].
[3]
Le demandeur affirme avoir été initié au christianisme en octobre 2009 par un ami qui l'a invité dans une maison-église clandestine. Il a ensuite été baptisé le 20 juin 2010 par un pasteur invité.
[4]
Le Bureau de la sécurité publique [BSP] aurait fait une descente dans cette maison-église pendant le culte le 21 novembre 2010. Le demandeur est alors allé se cacher chez un cousin. Il affirme que les agents du BSP le poursuivaient, et qu'ils se sont présentés chez lui et chez son frère à sa recherche. Il déclare en outre que le BSP a laissé chez lui le 25 novembre 2010 une assignation à comparaître. Il a en conséquence décidé de trouver un passeur pour le faire sortir de Chine avant que le BSP ne le rattrapât.
[5]
Le demandeur est arrivé au Canada le 25 février 2011 et y a demandé l'asile. La SPR a rendu le 29 août 2013 une décision portant qu'il n'avait qualité ni de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni de personne à protéger. C'est cette décision qui fait l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire.
III.
La décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[6]
L'identité du demandeur n'est pas mise en doute.
[7]
La SPR fait d'abord remarquer dans sa décision que la crédibilité du demandeur est entamée par son défaut de produire des éléments crédibles expliquant pourquoi il avait voulu se rendre au Brésil en 2007. La SPR voit un autre motif de douter de la crédibilité du demandeur dans le fait qu'il soit sorti de la clandestinité pour se marier le 21 février 2011, ce qu'il ne pouvait faire sans utiliser son numéro de carte d'identité de résident [CIR]. Se reportant aux documents sur le pays, la SPR explique que le BSP se sert d'une base de données appelée [traduction] « Bouclier doré » pour dépister les criminels fugitifs en Chine à l'aide des numéros de CIR. Le demandeur aurait donc été repéré par le BSP au moment de son mariage. La SPR juge également peu plausible que le demandeur se soit marié devant les autorités civiles le 21 février 2011 alors qu'il était en fuite depuis le 23 novembre 2010: l'entrée en rapport avec les autorités civiles, raisonne-t-elle, l'aurait exposé au danger d'être arrêté et détenu. Elle ne juge pas plus vraisemblable que le passeur du demandeur ait soudoyé l'agent de contrôle des sorties à l'aéroport afin de lui permettre de sortir de Chine, puisque les autorités peuvent facilement dépister ce passeur.
[8]
La SPR se dit en outre d'avis que le demandeur fait preuve d'une connaissance insuffisante de son groupe confessionnel et que son baptême au Canada n'était qu'un simulacre destiné à accroître les chances de sa demande d'asile. Qui plus est, les déclarations du demandeur sont contredites par la preuve documentaire sur la situation à Tianjin. La SPR conclut en conséquence à la non-crédibilité des déclarations du demandeur selon lesquelles le BSP aurait fait une descente dans la maison-église où son groupe se réunissait clandestinement, aurait arrêté et détenu plusieurs membres de ce groupe, et le rechercherait lui-même. La SPR ne reconnaît pas non plus au demandeur la qualité de chrétien authentique. Selon elle, il n'a adhéré à une église chrétienne au Canada que pour étayer sa demande d'asile frauduleuse.
[9]
Pour ce qui concerne la situation des chrétiens à Tianjin, la SPR constate, sur le fondement de la preuve documentaire, que les autorités ne réagissent pas dans cette ville aux activités religieuses clandestines de la même manière que dans d'autres provinces chinoises, où le prosélytisme est réprimé et où il arrive effectivement que des chrétiens ordinaires soient arrêtés ou d'autre manière persécutés. La politique religieuse appliquée à Tianjin compte en effet parmi les plus libérales de Chine. La SPR ajoute dans sa décision que la preuve documentaire produite ne porte aucune mention d'arrestations récentes de chrétiens laïques à Tianjin.
[10]
La SPR arrive donc à la conclusion que le demandeur n'est pas un témoin crédible et que le BSP ne le recherche pas en raison d'activités religieuses clandestines qu'il aurait exercées en Chine. Elle conclut enfin à l'absence de possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté en Chine pour motif de religion s'il souhaitait y pratiquer le christianisme.
IV.
Les conclusions des parties
[11]
Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a tiré des conclusions déraisonnables sur sa crédibilité en se fondant sur des conjectures et une interprétation erronée de la preuve documentaire, plus précisément pour ce qui concerne les projets de voyage au Brésil qu'il nourrissait quatre ans avant sa demande d'asile et l'utilisation de son passeport pour sortir de Chine en soudoyant l'agent de contrôle des sorties. Le demandeur affirme de plus que la SPR s'est trompée en se fondant sur les possibilités supposées du système panchinois dit [traduction] « Bouclier doré » dont les autorités se servent pour dépister les personnes. Le défendeur répond en faisant valoir que la preuve justifie la conclusion de non-crédibilité que la SPR tire de la manière dont le demandeur déclare être sorti de Chine. Le défendeur ajoute que le demandeur a mal interprété la preuve concernant le [traduction] « Bouclier doré » et que ce système couvre tout le territoire chinois.
[12]
Le demandeur soutient aussi que la SPR a tiré une conclusion déraisonnable touchant sa preuve documentaire, en omettant d'évaluer l'assignation assortie d'un mandat d'arrestation que le BSP a laissée à son intention chez ses parents, pour se contenter de déclarer cette pièce contrefaite. Le défendeur fait valoir de son côté que la preuve documentaire produite devant la SPR explique qu'il est très facile de se procurer de faux documents en Chine; étant donné cette preuve et les autres conclusions touchant la crédibilité, la conclusion de la SPR sur ce point est selon lui raisonnable.
[13]
Le demandeur avance en outre que la SPR a eu tort de nier qu'il fût un chrétien authentique au Canada et au moment de l'audience, comme elle s'est trompée en ne reconnaissant pas que l'interdiction de la pratique religieuse publique peut être assimilable à de la persécution pour motif de religion. Le défendeur exprime quant à lui l'avis qu'il était raisonnable de la part de la SPR d'évaluer la pratique religieuse du demandeur au Canada à la lumière de sa conclusion qu'il n'était pas un chrétien authentique en Chine; il estime également raisonnable la conclusion de la SPR selon laquelle la preuve n'établissait pas un risque sérieux de persécution pour les membres laïques des groupes chrétiens se réunissant dans des maisons-églises à Tianjin.
V.
Les questions en litige
[14]
Vu les conclusions et les dossiers respectifs des parties, je formulerai les questions en litige comme suit:
1. Les conclusions de la SPR sur la crédibilité sont-elles raisonnables?
2. La SPR a-t-elle tiré une conclusion déraisonnable à propos de l'assignation assortie d'un mandat d'arrestation décernée contre le demandeur?
3. La conclusion de la SPR sur l'identité religieuse du demandeur est-elle raisonnable?
4. La conclusion de la SPR sur le risque de persécution religieuse à Tianjin est-elle raisonnable?
VI.
La norme de contrôle judiciaire
[15]
L'appréciation par la SPR de la crédibilité des demandeurs d'asile relève au plus haut point des faits; voir
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [
Chen
]. La Cour appliquera donc la norme de la raisonnabilité au contrôle des conclusions de la SPR sur la crédibilité du demandeur (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 13, et
Chen
, précitée, paragraphe 14). Les trois autres questions formulées ci-dessus soulèvent des questions de droit qu'on ne peut aisément séparer des questions de fait, de sorte qu'elles ressortissent aussi à la norme de la raisonnabilité (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 9 [
Jing
]). La Cour n'interviendra donc que si elle conclut que la décision est déraisonnable et n'appartient pas « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACS no 9, paragraphe 47).
VII.
Analyse
A.
Les conclusions de la SPR sur la crédibilité sont-elles raisonnables?
[16]
L'évaluation de la crédibilité des demandeurs d'asile est au cœur de la compétence de la SPR (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 7 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Les conclusions de la SPR sur la crédibilité commandent donc la retenue judiciaire (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphes 27 et 31 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). La Cour n'interviendra que si la SPR « a rendu une décision ou une ordonnance fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont [elle] dispos[ait] » (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  116 FTR 310, paragraphe 6 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 35; et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 8).
[17]
En l'espèce, le premier argument du demandeur vise l'inférence défavorable tirée par la SPR de ses déclarations touchant le visa de visiteur pour le Brésil qu'il a obtenu en septembre 2007, soit environ quatre ans avant sa demande d'asile. Il soutient que la SPR a commis une erreur en prenant ce fait en compte, au motif de son caractère accessoire dans le contexte de la demande d'asile. J'en conviens avec le demandeur: il n'était pas légitime de tirer une inférence défavorable de ce fait, qui était dénué de pertinence et périphérique en regard de sa revendication ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, paragraphe 11). La conclusion de la SPR sur ce point est donc déraisonnable. Cependant, cela ne suffit pas en soi à rendre déraisonnable l'ensemble de sa décision, comme on verra plus loin.
[18]
Le demandeur a déclaré dans son témoignage à l'audience qu'une personne avait été arrêtée après la descente dans la maison-église. Il affirme que c'est sa femme qui l'a informé de cette arrestation. Il a aussi déclaré dans son témoignage que la personne arrêtée était en fait [traduction] « l'homme qui [lui] avait fait connaître » le groupe chrétien clandestin (dossier certifié du tribunal [DCT], pages 709 à 711). Cependant, on lit dans son Formulaire de renseignements personnels [FRP]: [traduction] « Jusqu'ici, je ne sais toujours pas qui a été arrêté » (dossier du demandeur [DD], page 46, paragraphe 12). La SPR a agi raisonnablement en tirant de cette contradiction une inférence défavorable sur la crédibilité du demandeur.
[19]
En outre, l'argument du demandeur selon lequel la SPR a fondé sa décision sur [traduction] « des conjectures, des inférences illégitimes et une interprétation erronée de la preuve documentaire produite devant elle » ne me paraît pas convaincant. La SPR a en effet le droit de fonder ses conclusions en matière de crédibilité sur le bon sens et la rationalité (
Jing
, précitée, paragraphe 15). L'appréciation par la SPR de la crédibilité du demandeur, basée sur le fait qu'il ait utilisé son passeport à l'aéroport au moment de quitter la Chine, sur sa décision de sortir de la clandestinité pour se marier devant les autorités civiles en utilisant sa CIR, et sur le fait qu'il ait oublié de signaler à la SPR les précautions qui devaient entourer les activités de son groupe religieux, mais se les soit rappelées lorsque celle-ci en a évoqué l'hypothèse - cette appréciation est raisonnable et étayée par la preuve documentaire que contient le dossier certifié du tribunal. Par exemple, cette preuve documentaire établit que la CIR doit être produite pour obtenir une licence de mariage, et qu'elle porte, en plus de la photographie de son détenteur, des renseignements tels que son nom, sa date de naissance, son adresse domiciliaire, son sexe, sa nationalité et ainsi de suite (DCT, page 121). Ladite preuve documentaire établit en outre que le réseau informatique national connu sous le nom de [traduction] « Bouclier doré » qu'utilise le BSP lui sert à suivre, entre autres, les entrées et sorties de passeports (DCT, page 140) (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 15 [
Hao
]). Les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité que la SPR a tirées sur ces points sont par conséquent raisonnables.
B.
La SPR a-t-elle tiré une conclusion déraisonnable à propos de l'assignation assortie d'un mandat d'arrestation décernée contre le demandeur?
[20]
Contrairement à la thèse du demandeur, la décision de la SPR de considérer comme un faux l'assignation assortie d'un mandat d'arrestation qu'il a produite et de ne lui accorder aucun poids est raisonnable (
Jing
, précitée, paragraphe 17). La SPR a examiné ce document, et conclu qu'il était un faux en se fondant sur le peu de crédibilité du demandeur et sur la preuve établissant l'abondante circulation de documents contrefaits en Chine (DD, page 18, paragraphes 49 et 50). Je pense en outre comme le défendeur que la jurisprudence citée à ce propos par le demandeur, soit
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  n'aide pas ce dernier à établir le bien-fondé de sa thèse. En effet, la Cour a conclu dans cette décision que la SPR n'avait pas évalué la preuve invoquée par le demandeur ni tenu compte d'autres éléments produits par lui. Or tel n'est pas le cas ici. Dans la présente espèce, en effet, la SPR a bel et bien évalué les documents produits par le demandeur, tels que l'assignation assortie d'un mandat d'arrestation, son certificat de baptême, la lettre de son pasteur et les photographies (DD, page 19, paragraphes 48 à 52). Elle n'a pas omis de tenir compte de l'assignation ni d'aucun autre document, mais les a analysés dans le contexte de la demande d'asile du demandeur. L'intervention de la Cour à cet égard ne se justifierait donc pas.
C.
La conclusion de la SPR sur l'identité religieuse du demandeur est-elle raisonnable?
[21]
Je ne puis non plus convenir avec le demandeur que la SPR ait omis d'analyser les éléments de preuve qu'il a produits afin d'établir l'authenticité de sa foi et de ses convictions religieuses. Contrairement à la thèse du demandeur, la SPR a sans conteste évalué dans sa décision la lettre du pasteur, le certificat de baptême et les photographies qu'il a produits, comme nous l'avons vu plus haut (DD, page 19, paragraphe 48 à 52). La SPR a examiné la question de l'identité religieuse du demandeur en se fondant sur la preuve et à la lumière de ses conclusions sur la crédibilité (
Jing
, précitée, paragraphes 22 et 23;
Hao
, précitée, paragraphes 17 et 18; et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 27). L'analyse de ce point effectuée par la SPR est donc raisonnable. Le demandeur demande en fait à la Cour d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve, ce qui n'est pas son rôle.
D.
La conclusion de la SPR sur le risque de persécution religieuse à Tianjin est-elle raisonnable?
[22]
Je conclus que la SPR a effectué une analyse approfondie de la preuve documentaire concernant la situation des chrétiens à Tianjin et qu'elle l'a effectuée de manière prospective. Le demandeur conteste principalement la conclusion de la SPR sur ladite situation. Or cette conclusion, prise en soi, ne peut rendre la décision de la SPR déraisonnable (
Jing
, précitée, paragraphe 27). Le demandeur propose simplement une interprétation différente de celle de la SPR. En outre, l'analyse de la SPR se fonde sur son évaluation de divers éléments de preuve documentaire contenus dans le dossier: elle n'a pas omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve ni n'a interprété la preuve de manière erronée. En effet, elle a apprécié la preuve en se posant la question de savoir s'il y avait une possibilité sérieuse que le demandeur soit persécuté pour motif de pratique de la religion chrétienne dans une Église non enregistrée à Tianjin, et elle a effectué cette analyse indépendamment de ses conclusions antérieures concernant le demandeur (DD, pages 20 à 26, paragraphes 59 à 76).
[23]
Le demandeur attire aussi l'attention sur le rapport annuel de 2010 de China Aid [le rapport de China Aid], qu'il présente comme une source d'information fiable sur la persécution des chrétiens pratiquant dans des maisons-églises en Chine (DD, page 155, paragraphes 42 à 44). Ce rapport fait expressément état des mesures prises par les autorités municipales de Tianjin pour démolir le temple de l'Église Immanuel. Le demandeur fait valoir que la SPR a refusé de prendre ce fait en considération, ce qui rend sa décision déraisonnable. Or il se trouve que le même argument, fondé sur le même document, a été mis en avant dans
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Le juge Russell formule au paragraphe 71 de cette décision les observations suivantes sur le document et l'événement en question:
En fin de compte, la demanderesse peut invoquer uniquement le rapport de 2010 de China Aid selon lequel des chrétiens coréens ont été expulsés de Tianjin et selon lequel, dans le comté de Jinghai, les autorités ont tenté de détruire l'immeuble de l'église Immanuel, qui servait aux réunions. Le contexte détaillé de ces événements n'est pas expliqué, de sorte que nous ne connaissons pas les raisons pour lesquelles les autorités auraient agi de cette façon ni l'importance de ces mesures pour la pratique générale du christianisme à Tianjin. Nous ne savons pas non plus si ces mesures constitueraient une forme de persécution selon la Convention et le droit canadien des réfugiés [...]
[24]
Les mêmes remarques s'appliquent à la présente espèce: le demandeur n'a pas produit plus de renseignements sur l'événement en question. Après avoir évalué le rapport de China Aid et les autres éléments de preuve documentaire produits, la SPR écrit ce qui suit:
Le tribunal a pris en considération la preuve documentaire traitant des conditions à Tianjin ainsi que les circonstances propres au demandeur d'asile. Le tribunal conclut, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le demandeur d'asile serait en mesure de pratiquer sa religion présumée au sein de la congrégation chrétienne de son choix s'il retournait chez lui à Tianjin, en Chine, et qu'il n'existe pas de possibilité sérieuse qu'il soit persécuté pour cette raison. (DD, page 29, paragraphe 86.)
La SPR a aussi évalué la situation générale des chrétiens en Chine, pour constater que la pratique religieuse et les niveaux de tolérance y varient considérablement d'une région à l'autre (DD, pages 21 et 22, paragraphes 62 à 64).
[25]
Par conséquent, contrairement aux dires du demandeur, la SPR n'a pas déraisonnablement omis de tenir compte des éléments de preuve en question. Je ne vois aucune erreur justifiant l'intervention de la Cour dans l'évaluation qu'a donnée la SPR de la situation des chrétiens à Tianjin. Sa conclusion sur ce point est raisonnable, et s'avère l'être encore plus à la lumière de cette autre conclusion raisonnable qu'il faut rappeler, selon laquelle le demandeur n'a pas participé au culte de la maison-église clandestine en Chine et n'était pas un chrétien pratiquant (DD, page 17, paragraphe 44). On voit donc que la SPR a pris en considération la preuve documentaire produite et en a tiré des conclusions raisonnables sur la situation des chrétiens à Tianjin.
VIII.
Dispositif
[26]
Exception faite des conclusions qu'elle a tirées de l'obtention par le demandeur d'un visa de visiteur pour le Brésil en 2007, je conclus que toutes les conclusions de la SPR - sur la crédibilité, sur l'assignation assortie d'un mandat d'arrestation, sur l'identité religieuse du demandeur et le risque de poursuites auquel cette identité l'exposerait à Tianjin, etc. - confèrent à sa décision un caractère raisonnable.
[27]
Les avocats des parties n'ont proposé aucune question pour la certification.

LA COUR STATUE que:
1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.
2. Il n'y a pas de question grave de portée générale à certifier.
