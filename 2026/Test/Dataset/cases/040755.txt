Muldoon, J.
: The applicant was examined by an adjudicator and a member of the Immigration Refugee Board in a "credible basis" hearing on March 2, 1992. The tribunal formally notified the applicant on June 10, 1992 that he did not have a credible basis for a Convention refugee claim. Also, on June 10, 1992, the adjudicator issued a deportation order pursuant to a s. 27 report. The applicant sought judicial review of the credible basis hearing decision on December 23, 1992. This matter was subject to the transitional provisions of Direction no. 19 and did not require leave.
[2]
The applicant, a citizen of Pakistan, arrived in Canada on October 6, 1990 on a valid visitor's visa issued in Jamaica. A second passport was issued to the applicant by the Pakistan Consulate on October 9, 1990 in Toronto. On October 10, 1990, the applicant made his Convention refugee claim to immigration officials. During his interview with an immigration officer he admitted that he had left Canada for the United States sometime after arriving on October 6th and returned to Canada hidden in the back of a truck on October 8th. The applicant became the subject of a s. 27 report with the possibility of a departure or deportation notice.
[3]
The applicant states that he is or was a high-ranking member of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). When the Bhutto government in Pakistan collapsed, hostility grew towards members of the PPP and because the applicant was a highly visible member of the PPP, General Secretary of the Lahore Unit, he and his extended family were endangered. The applicant states that his family's compound was fire-bombed by militants of the Muslim League and that his brother-in-law was killed as a result. The applicant was advised by other party members that Pakistan was far too dangerous for someone of his political stature and that he should quit the country. The applicant arrived in Canada via, Dubai, England, Jamaica, Antigua, Tartola, Antigua and Jamaica.
[4]
The applicant's submissions are that:
"1. The tribunal erred in law in determining that the applicant did not have a credible basis to his claim to be a Convention refugee because no evidence had been presented to the panel beyond that given in the Personal Information Form and oral testimony that the applicant is a member of the Pakistan People's Party.
2. The tribunal erred in law and made erroneous findings of fact made in a capricious manner and without regard to the material before it in determining that the applicant's evidence that he fears the authoirities [sic] in Pakistan is not credible in view of the evidence that he approached or caused those authorities to be approached in order to obtain a passport.
3. The tribunal erred in law and made erroneous findings of fact made in a capricious manner without regard to the material before it in determining that the applicant had not been a truthful witness during the inquiry.
4. The tribunal erred in law and failed to observe the principles of natural justice in that the Adjudicator's particapation [sic] in the credible basis hearing after his eralier [sic] participation in the inquiry for the same applicant gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. (This was not argued in the memorandum of argument.)"
[5]
The applicant cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), for the proposition that when a claimant swears to the truth it is presumed that he is telling the truth unless there are reasons to doubt the truthfulness. The applicant submits that the tribunal should accept as truth his involvement with the PPP. Second, the applicant submits that there is a difference between reasonable inference and pure conjecture,
Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), and that the tribunal's conclusions regarding the manner in which the applicant obtained his passports was pure conjecture and not a reasonable inference based on the testimony of the applicant. Thirdly, the applicant submits that when basing a negative decision on a person's credibility the board is required to do so in clear and unmistakeable terms,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.L.R.(2d) 199 (F.C.A.). It is the applicant's position that the tribunal did not clearly explain why it found the applicant lacking in credibility. Finally, the applicant submits that the tribunal erred in that it concentrated on other matters not related to the persecution of the applicant.
[6]
The respondent relies upon the factual findings and determinations made by the credible basis tribunal on June 10, 1992. In particular, the respondent relies upon fifteen determinations, recorded in the transcript of the tribunal's oral decision rendered on that day. They extend over four foolscap typed pages and they are of convincing quality. One example contrasts the applicant's assertion that he was a longstanding and important official of the Pakistan People's Party (now again in power under the leadership of Ms. Benazir Bhutto) with his lack of production of even a membership card or a newspaper account in which such an important personage as he, is mentioned. There was nothing but the word of a silly boaster who stated that in approaching authorities he sometimes tells the truth, but sometimes, also, evades it by concealment. The record is full of examples upon which the tribunal was entitled to find that the applicant had no credible basis for claiming reliably to be a refugee.
[7]
In the respondent's well argued submissions found at pp. 6-13 of tab 1 of the respondent's record, there is ample evidence adduced in the transcript and respondent's memorandum of argument which shows that the applicant's testimony was evasive, implausible, contradictory and, at times, flew in the face of proved documentary evidence. The tribunal is supported by the record in gravely doubting the veracity of the applicant's statements.
[8]
It is perfectly acceptable for a tribunal to find an applicant lacking in credibility according to implausibilities in the applicant's testimony. For example:
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). However, where the tribunal finds a lack of credibility based on inferences, there must be a basis in the evidence to support the inferences. Such inferences must be reasonably open to the tribunal based on the evidence of the applicant.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.L.R.(2d) 39 (T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). Where the tribunal's inferences are based on what seemed to be "common sense" or rational perceptions about how a government regime in another country might be expected to act or react in a given set of circumstances, there is an obligation, out of fairness, to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address those inferences on which the tribunal relies.
Nkrumah and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.L.R.(2d) 246 (T.D.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). The tribunal must have regard for the totality of the evidence before it when assessing credibility. The tribunal cannot make an adverse credibility finding while ignoring evidence by the claimant explaining apparent inconsistencies. If the tribunal when making findings of fact misconstrues or ignores the evidence before it, and relies upon these findings when making an adverse determination as to credibility, the decision will be quashed.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.L.R.(2d) 294 (T.D.). Such is not the case here.
[9]
The construction of the applicant's rendition of how he obtained two passports is rather appropriately described as conjecture. The tribunal is allowed to base findings of lack of credibility on implausibilities in the applicant's testimony. In this instance, the applicant's testimony and the record support the tribunal's finding more than do the assertions of the applicant.
[10]
The respondent has invoked the decision of Nöel, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), for the proposition that the Court should defer to the tribunal on questions of credibility, even if the court could have decided differently, and this judge decided similarly in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  one: it is one upon which reasonable people might even disagree. The conclusions of the CRDD, here, were reasonably open to it, based on the totality of the evidence adduced. It, therefore, did not err in law. Any lack of specific mention of some of the oral or documentary evidence, here, was not fatal to the CRDD's disposition. The tribunal is seen to have weighed the evidence, regarding its reliability and co-gency, in proper manner. Surely there was evidence upon which the decision can be based."
[11]
The respondent, in his submissions, cites
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm.L.R.(2d) 241 (F.C.A.), for the proposition that the tribunal is not required to refer an applicant's matter to Convention refugee determination if
any
credible evidence exists. It runs:
"The test to be employed on a credible basis hearing is first whether there is any credible evidence and second, given the presence of some credible evidence, might the Refugee Division, after a full hearing, determine the applicant to be a Convention refugee."
[12]
Further, the court in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), goes beyond this and states that the tribunal can make a "credible evidence" assessment solely on the basis of the applicant's credibility. The tribunal specifically referred to instances and particular passages in the applicant's testimony which bring his credibility into question. It is submitted that the tribunal has given reasons in clear and unmistaken terms for which it found the applicant to be lacking in credibility. Finally, the court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, recognized the specialized nature of the tribunal and accorded it deference with respect to assessments based on plausibility and credibility.
[13]
The tribunal assessed the applicant fairly and in accordance with the law. The tribunal did not commit a reviewable error and it correctly found that the applicant lacked a credible basis for a Convention claim. This application ought to be dismissed.
Application dismissed.
