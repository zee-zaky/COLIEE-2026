I. INTRODUCTION
[1]
Heneghan, J.
: Air Spray (1967) Ltd. (the "Applicant") seeks judicial review of the decision of Mr. Richard Bourassa (the "Adjudicator"), dated April 24, 2012. The Adjudicator found that Mr. Mark Paulsen (the "Respondent") had been unjustly dismissed by his employer, the Applicant. He awarded damages to the Respondent in the amount of $17,556.00 less the proper statutory deductions and costs of $500.00, pursuant to the
Canada Labour Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2 (the "Canada Labour Code").
II. PRELIMINARY MATTERS
[2]
The Respondent was served with the Notice of Application on May 21, 2012, according to the affidavit of Bill R. Vanson, Process Server. The Respondent filed a Notice of Appearance on May 28, 2012, indicating that he intended to oppose the application but he did not file a responding application record.
[3]
According to a log of phone calls maintained by the Office of the Chief Justice in Ottawa, a voicemail had been left for the Respondent on October 5, 2012, advising that the matter would be heard in Edmonton, Alberta, for one day.
[4]
By letter dated October 25, 2012, a certified copy of the Order setting the hearing date of January 17, 2013, was sent to the Respondent by registered mail. The letter was returned to the Registry of the Court at 90 Sparks Street as unclaimed.
[5]
The January 17, 2013 hearing was adjourned by Order of Justice Kane made on January 15, 2013. A letter dated January 15, 2013, forwarding that Order was sent to the Respondent by registered mail on January 15, 2013; that letter was returned to the Registry of the Court in Ottawa because it had been sent to a non-existent address. The Respondent's address had been incorrectly entered on the envelope.
[6]
By letter dated January 21, 2013, an Order setting a new hearing date of April 11, 2013, was sent to the Respondent by registered mail. This letter was sent to the address on file for the Respondent but was returned to the Registry of the Court at 90 Sparks Street, Ottawa.
[7]
I am satisfied that reasonable steps were taken by the Court administration to advise the Respondent of the hearing dates. The fact that one communication was sent to the wrong address is not determinative since the subsequent letter of January 21, 2013, advising of the hearing date of April 11, 2013, was sent to the correct address provided by the Respondent. He did not take delivery of that letter.
[8]
There is another procedural matter to be addressed. Upon review of the file prior to the hearing in April, I observed that no Tribunal Record had been filed, pursuant to the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106 (the "Rules"). A Direction was issued on April 4, 2013, directing the Applicant to file the Tribunal Record on or before April 11, 2013.
[9]
Counsel for the Applicant responded to the Direction by letter dated April 5, 2013. In part that letter advised as follows:
The Affidavit in the Applicant's Record includes all of the Applicant's documents that were put before the Adjudicator; no new or additional documents were included. We also included the documents of the Respondent that were referenced at the hearing. As the Adjudicator has not provided the Court with a Record, we enclose a complete package of all Exhibits and documents entered.
[10]
I was not satisfied that the affidavit of Kirk Carleton, included in the Applicant's Record, included all the documents, nor was I satisfied that the further materials submitted by Counsel for the Applicant included all the materials that were before the Adjudicator. Specifically, a comparison of the Applicant's Record with the Exhibit Book showed that Exhibit A to the affidavit of Kirk Carleton was not contained in the Exhibit Book and that Exhibit U to the affidavit of Mr. Carleton was not contained in the Exhibit Book.
[11]
At the hearing on April 11, 2013, the Applicant provided a copy of the materials maintained by the Adjudicator. It subsequently became known that this material did not include a handwritten document submitted by the Respondent at the hearing before the Adjudicator. By further Direction of the Court issued on October 8, 2013, leave was given to file a Supplementary Certified Tribunal Record,
nunc pro tunc
, to include that document.
III. FACTS
[12]
The Respondent was employed by the Applicant from October 2006 to February 17, 2011. He was hired as a Crew Chief but was demoted to the position of "Structures Mechanic 4" in October 2007. Between June 2008 and December 2009, he was disciplined five times, twice for using his cell phone in the hangar, once for failing to report his absence, once for falling behind schedule, and once for allowing someone else to do work assigned to him.
[13]
On January 19, 2011, the Respondent and a co-worker, John Rowe, were working on a plane. Mr. Rowe asked the Respondent to hold onto a drill while he drilled holes into an airplane spar. Mr. Rowe did not follow the standard procedure of drilling the holes using the aircraft skin as a template. Full-size rather than pilot holes were also drilled. As a result, the holes in the spar were misaligned with the aircraft skin.
[14]
The Respondent was more experienced than Mr. Rowe but neither corrected him or reported the incident. Co-workers were in the hangar at the time but did not hear or see what happened.
[15]
On February 9, 2011, Mr. Bob Strain, the Structural Supervisor, noticed the defective work. On February 10, 2011, Mr. Rowe, the Respondent, and three other co-workers submitted incident/hazard reporting forms, as part of the Applicant's anonymous safety reporting system. Another co-worker submitted an incident/hazard reporting form on February 17, 2011.
[16]
On February 17, 2011, the Applicant dismissed the Respondent. The dismissal letter states that on January 19, 2011, the Respondent drilled misaligned holes in an aircraft spar, in serious breach of the safety management system. The letter further said that the incident was exacerbated by the Respondent's considerable experience and his failure to recognize the seriousness of the error. The letter also stated that the incident followed previous written and oral warnings relating to the Respondent's job performance.
[17]
On May 6, 2011, the Respondent submitted an unjust dismissal complaint to Human Resources and Development Canada, pursuant to Part III of the Canada Labour Code.
[18]
A draft invoice dated March 21, 2012, indicates that the Applicant paid $10,666.73 to correct the damage to the aircraft (Exhibit 1, Tab 16).
[19]
On March 22, 2012, a hearing was held before the Adjudicator.
IV. DECISION UNDER REVIEW
[20]
In the decision of April 24, 2012, the Adjudicator found that the Respondent had been unjustly dismissed. The Adjudicator noted that the onus of proving the existence of just cause lay with the Applicant, and that just cause requires serious misconduct which is clearly inconsistent with an employee's express or implied service, and risks injury to the employer's interest through continued employment.
[21]
The Adjudicator found that the Applicant had not met the burden of proving that the dismissal was just. He acknowledged the Applicant's argument that the error constituted serious misconduct with potentially catastrophic consequences, and that the Respondent was responsible for the error because he was the more experienced employee. He noted that the Respondent had not been the Crew Chief, and had similar experience to the employees other than Mr. Rowe. He also observed that Mr. Strain's incident report indicated that only two holes were misaligned on the wing on which the Respondent assisted Mr. Rowe, and that almost all the reports described the damage as "minor". The Adjudicator concluded that the Applicant was attempting to blame the Respondent rather than accepting responsibility for failing to have appropriate supervision for Mr. Rowe.
[22]
With respect to damages, the Adjudicator stated that adjudicators are not limited to awarding compensation to what could be claimed under the common law, relying on the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Adjudicator noted the dates when the Respondent found contract work and how much leave he took during that employment period. He noted that the Respondent followed an apprenticeship program to retrain as a welder. He also noted that the Respondent supplemented his income by working overtime, so that his annual income was almost equal to what he would have made with the Applicant. The Adjudicator noted that the Respondent was out of work for approximately 21 days and that there was a difference in his hourly wage. He awarded the Respondent three months salary, that being $17,556.00 less statutory deductions, as well as $500.00 in costs.
V. APPLICANT'S SUBMISSIONS
[23]
The Applicant argues that the Adjudicator erred by failing to analyze the Respondent's conduct in a contextual and proportionate manner as discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that is considering the nature and circumstances of the misconduct and the extent to which such misconduct is reconcilable with the employment relationship.
[24]
Next, the Applicant argues that the Adjudicator failed to assess the Respondent's misconduct in relation to the history of discipline taken against the Respondent. The Adjudicator only referred to the two incidents where the Respondent had used his cell phone in the hangar, although the Respondent had been disciplined for other incidents, including the failure to complete his work in a timely manner, in June 2008.
[25]
Third, the Applicant submits that the adjudicator erred by failing to consider the airline industry context and the strict guidelines that govern it. It relies on the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 131 and 143, where an employee who damaged a floor panel and attempted to hide the damage was found to have been dismissed with cause.
[26]
The Applicant argues that in the present case, the Adjudicator did not discuss the aviation industry but stated that only two holes were misaligned and that nearly all the incident reporting forms referred to the damage as minor.
[27]
Finally, the Applicant submits that the Adjudicator failed to consider the Respondent's dishonesty. It argues that according to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Courts require that the nature and degree of dishonesty be considered to determine whether it is reconcilable with maintaining the employment relationship. The Adjudicator accepted that the Respondent drilled the holes in the spar and that he assisted Mr. Rowe in drilling holes.
[28]
As for the award of damages, the Applicant argues that the Adjudicator erred by failing to properly deduct the amount earned by the Respondent in mitigation from the award. It submits that the Adjudicator apparently based his award on the fact that the Respondent's hourly wage as a welder was less than his hourly wage while employed by the Applicant, together with the fact that the Respondent mitigated his losses by working overtime.
[29]
The Applicant claims that this is an error since the case law provides that an employee should be compensated for actual losses and the Respondent did not suffer such loss. It argues that the failure to deduct income earned after his dismissal is inconsistent with the Canada Labour Code which is not intended to grant a windfall to an employee who has obtained employment of greater value, relying in this regard in the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 52.
VI. DISCUSSION AND DISPOSITION
[30]
The Applicant challenged both the Adjudicator's finding of unjust dismissal and the remedy that was granted, that is three months salary and costs in the amount of $500.00. The finding of unjust dismissal is a question of mixed fact and law reviewable on the standard of reasonableness; see the decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 32. The issue of remedy is also reviewable on the standard of reasonableness; see the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 34.
[31]
In my opinion, the Adjudicator's conclusion as to the unjust dismissal of the Respondent is reasonable having regard to the evidence submitted. Essentially, the Applicant is arguing that the Adjudicator ignored the context of the Respondent's dismissal, in particular his disciplinary history, his experience relative to Mr. Rowe and the safety standards for the airline industry.
[32]
In my opinion, the decision and the contents of the Exhibit Book show that the Adjudicator did not ignore this evidence. He, the Adjudicator, specifically referred to the Applicant's argument about the potentially serious consequences of the error and the argument that the Respondent should have acted differently in light of his greater experience. He also referred to the Respondent's disciplinary history even if he did not mention the incident of December 2009.
[33]
The Adjudicator also undertook a reasonable, contextual analysis of the alleged misconduct. The evidence before the Adjudicator was that the Respondent had been dismissed for having drilled the holes. From my reading of the decision, the Adjudicator accepted that Mr. Rowe had acknowledged drilling the holes and that the Respondent had only held the drill straight. The Adjudicator rightly and reasonably noted that all but one of the incident reports characterized the damage as "minor". The reports also said that the work was done under a tight deadline.
[34]
The Applicant also argues that the Adjudicator failed to take into account the Respondent's dishonesty. However, in my view, the argument had no basis. There is nothing in the exhibit book to show that the Respondent did not acknowledge the mistake. The Adjudicator seems to have acknowledged the fact that the alleged misconduct occurred in the context of the airline industry. That he did not elaborate on this fact does not make his decision unreasonable. The decision meets the standard of "reasonableness" in that it is transparent and justifiable on the basis of the evidence; see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47.
[35]
The Adjudicator reasonably found that the Applicant had failed to discharge its burden of showing that the Respondent had been dismissed for cause.
[36]
Turning now to the questions of remedy, this issue is also reviewable on the standard of reasonableness, in the context of the Code.
[37]
The Adjudicator's remedial powers in this case are governed by subsection 242(4) of the Canada Labour Code. Paragraph 242(4)(a) allows an adjudicator to make an order requiring the employer to pay the person compensation equivalent to the remuneration that would have been paid during the notice period. Paragraph 242(4)(c) allows the adjudicator to require the employer to do "any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal". The jurisprudence of the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal emphasizes that adjudicators have broad remedial powers to "make whole" an employee who was unjustly dismissed; see the decisions in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[38]
The Federal Court has also held that there is a distinction between damages for unjust dismissal and compensation for the time that an employee would have been working. "Just cause protection" relates to the principle that the Code mandates compensation for those who are unjustly dismissed, even if they received severance pay.
[39]
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice O'Keefe distinguished between severance pay and damages, adopting the reasoning of Adjudicator J.M. Gordon in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):
38 It is clear that the applicant is equating the award of damages with a severance payment. I do not agree with the applicant. By way of explanation, I would adapt the reasoning of Adjudicator J.M. Gordon in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), as to the interplay between the termination and unjust dismissal provisions of the Code, and apply it to this case:
...
31. [...] As I have already observed, I find the reasoning of the Federal Court and the Adjudicators cited by the Complainant to be consistent with the purpose of this part of the Code and the intention of Parliament as expressed in the language of the Code. In MacDonald -and-Northern Thunderbird Air Ltd., [1995] C.L.A.D. No. 551, the Adjudicator rejected the employer's argument that it could terminate an employee without alleging cause by simply paying severance pay such that the employee's only recourse was to bring a civil action. The Adjudicator rejected that argument in the following terms:
If an employer terminates the employee and pays severance without alleging any cause, that does not in itself disentitle the employee from claiming that he/she has been unjustly dismissed. If that were so, then the intention of Parliament expressed in Section 240 of the Code to provide a remedy for employees who have been unjustly dismissed would be thwarted by employers simply paying the severance pay required under Section 235... .
If Parliament intended to limit unjust dismissal complaints to those persons who were terminated and were provided with reasons for the dismissal, it would have clearly stated that to be the case in Section 240 and made Section 240 subject to Section 235. (at page 2).
[40]
Similar reasoning was recently followed by Justice O'Reilly in his decision in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The remedial scope of the Canada Labour Code was addressed by Justice Nadon in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 53 where he stated:
An adjudicator awarding damages for unjust dismissal is entitled to set the amount of the award. The award is intended to compensate the employee for damages actually suffered as a result of the dismissal. While there is discretion in the amount of damages that may be awarded, an adjudicator commits an error when he or she limits the amount of the award to the amount of severance to which the employee would be entitled if the dismissal had been a justified one based on s. 235 or the common law.
[41]
Justice Nadon relied on
Alberta Wheat Pool
in support of the above statement. Howard Levitt, in his text
The Law of Dismissal in Canada
, 3d ed. loose-leaf (consulted on July 26th, 2013), (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2003) ch. 2 at 125-126, notes that in the Canada Labour Code context, "in most cases of unjust dismissal, damages in lieu of reasonable notice is a sufficient remedy where reinstatement is not requested or is inappropriate". He also observes that the objective of an award of damages is to place the aggrieved party in a position as near as possible to what he or she would have been in had the contract been performed.
[42]
The Adjudicator addressed the issue of damages and the decision in
Alberta Wheat Pool
at paragraph 20 of his decision:
With respect to the matter of damages in lieu of proper notice Chief Justice [Iacobucci] as he was then of the Federal Appeal Court found in [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the court stated "We are also of the view that interpretation of paragraphs 61.5(9)(a) of the Canadian Labour Code ...cannot be read [down] so as to limit the compensation that [a] adjudicator is empowered to award to an employee to the amount that could be claimed under the common law".
[43]
He went on to refer to the details of the Respondent's job search after his dismissal, including his lower wages and overtime pay. He further stated that the Respondent had been out of work for approximately 21 days and concluded by awarding him three months salary in the sum of $17,556.00 in lieu of proper notice. Reading the Adjudicator's reasons as a whole, it is clear that he relied on the decision in
Alberta Wheat Pool
to support the award.
[44]
The Respondent had worked with the Applicant for over four years. Although his earnings in the new position at face value matched those that he would have earned if not unjustly dismissed by the Applicant, the Respondent was required to work longer hours, including overtime, in order to generate the same income. Having regard to all the circumstances and the relevant legal principles, the Adjudicator's award was reasonable.
[45]
In the result, there is no basis for judicial intervention and this application will be dismissed.
[46]
There remains the question of costs. The Respondent did not participate in this proceeding, apart from filing a Notice of Appearance. Rule 400(1) confers full discretion on the Court relative to the award of costs and provides as follows:
400. (1) The Court shall have full discretionary power over the amount and allocation of costs and the determination of by whom they are to be paid.
400. (1) La Cour a le pouvoir discrétionnaire de déterminer le montant des dépens, de les répartir et de désigner les personnes qui doivent les payer.
[47]
Having regard to the circumstances and the fact that the Respondent did not actively respond to this application, having only filed a Notice of Appearance, in the exercise of my discretion, I make no order as to costs.
JUDGMENT
[48]
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
the application for judicial review is dismissed, in the exercise of my discretion no order as to costs.
.........................
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demanderesse) sollicite le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 24 avril 2012 par M. Richard Bourassa (l'arbitre). Selon l'arbitre, M. Mark Paulsen (le défendeur) a été injustement congédié par son employeur, la société demanderesse en l'espèce. En application du
Code canadien du travail
, L.R.C. 1985, ch. L-2 (le
Code canadien du travail
), l'arbitre a accordé au défendeur une indemnité de 17 556 $, moins les retenues légales, plus 500 $ au titre des dépens.
II. QUESTIONS PRÉLIMINAIRES
[2]
Selon l'affidavit de Bill R. Vanson, huissier, l'avis de demande a été signifié au défendeur le 21 mai 2012. Le 28 mai 2012, le défendeur a déposé un avis de comparution dans lequel il indiquait son attention de contester la demande, mais il n'a pas déposé de dossier de réponse.
[3]
D'après le registre des appels téléphoniques tenu à Ottawa par le Bureau du juge en chef, un message vocal a été envoyé au défendeur le 5 octobre 2012, lui laissant savoir que l'affaire serait instruite à Edmonton (Alberta), lors d'une audience d'une journée.
[4]
Par lettre en date du 25 octobre 2012, une copie vidimée de l'ordonnance fixant au 17 janvier 2013 la date de l'audience a été envoyée au défendeur par courrier recommandé. La lettre, qui n'avait pas été remise à son destinataire, fut renvoyée au greffe de la Cour, au 90, rue Sparks.
[5]
Le 17 janvier 2013, l'audience fut reportée en vertu d'une ordonnance prononcée par la juge Kane le 15 janvier 2013. Une lettre en date du 15 janvier 2013 a été le même jour envoyée au défendeur par courrier recommandé pour lui communiquer l'ordonnance. Cette lettre fut renvoyée au greffe de la Cour, à Ottawa, l'adresse figurant sur l'enveloppe étant inexistante. L'adresse du défendeur avait été inscrite incorrectement sur l'enveloppe.
[6]
Par lettre en date du 21 janvier 2013, une ordonnance fixant au 11 avril 2013 la nouvelle date d'audience fut envoyée au défendeur par courrier recommandé. Cette lettre, envoyée à l'adresse figurant au dossier du défendeur, fut renvoyée au greffe de la Cour, au 90, rue Sparks, Ottawa (Ontario).
[7]
J'estime que les services administratifs de la Cour ont fait des efforts raisonnables pour informer le défendeur des dates d'audience. Le fait qu'un des courriers ait été envoyé à la mauvaise adresse n'est pas déterminant, car une lettre subséquente, en date du 21 janvier 2013, l'informant de l'audience du 11 avril 2013, a été envoyée à la bonne adresse, celle qu'avait fournie le défendeur. Il n'a pas cependant pris réception de cette lettre.
[8]
Une autre question de procédure appelle notre attention. J'ai constaté, après examen du dossier avant l'audience du mois d'avril, que le dossier de la Cour prévu par les
Règles des Cours fédérales
, DORS/98-106 (les Règles) n'avait pas été déposé. Le 4 avril 2013, une directive fut envoyée à la demanderesse, la priant de déposer le dossier de la Cour le 11 avril 2013 au plus tard.
[9]
L'avocat de la demanderesse a répondu à la directive par lettre en date du 5 avril 2013. Cette lettre faisait notamment savoir ce qui suit:
[traduction]
L'affidavit versé au dossier de la demanderesse comprend tous les documents que la demanderesse avait produits devant l'arbitre; ce dossier ne comprend aucun document nouveau ou supplémentaire. Nous y avons également inséré les documents du défendeur auxquels il avait renvoyé à l'audience. L'arbitre n'ayant pas transmis de dossier à la Cour, nous joignons un jeu complet des pièces et documents qui avaient été déposés.
[10]
Je ne crois pas que l'affidavit de Kirk Carleton, qui figurait au dossier de la demanderesse, comprenait l'intégralité des documents, et je ne crois pas non plus que les autres documents versés au dossier par l'avocat de la demanderesse comprenaient l'intégralité des documents produits devant l'arbitre. Plus précisément, la comparaison entre le dossier de la demanderesse et le recueil des pièces fait ressortir que la pièce A jointe à l'affidavit de Kirk Carleton ne figurait pas au recueil des pièces et que la pièce U, jointe à l'affidavit de M. Carleton, n'y figurait pas non plus.
[11]
À l'audience du 11 avril 2013, la demanderesse a remis une copie de la documentation qu'avait réunie l'arbitre. On s'est aperçu par la suite que cette documentation ne comprenait pas un document manuscrit que le défendeur avait produit devant l'arbitre. Une nouvelle directive de la Cour, en date du 8 octobre 2013, autorisa le dépôt
nunc pro tunc
, d'un dossier certifié supplémentaire du tribunal comprenant le document en question.
III. LES FAITS
[12]
Le défendeur a été employé par la demanderesse du mois d'octobre 2006 au 17 février 2011. Il avait été engagé comme chef d'équipe, mais en octobre 2007, fut rétrogradé au poste de « Mécanicien de structures de niveau 4 ». Entre juin 2008 et décembre 2009, il a fait l'objet de sanctions disciplinaires à cinq reprises, deux fois pour s'être servi de son téléphone portable dans le hangar, une fois pour ne pas avoir signalé une absence, une fois pour avoir pris du retard et une fois pour avoir permis à un autre d'effectuer le travail dont il était lui-même chargé.
[13]
Le 19 janvier 2011, le défendeur et John Rowe, un collègue, réparaient un avion. Monsieur Rowe demanda au défendeur de tenir la perceuse pendant qu'il perçait des trous dans un longeron. Monsieur Rowe n'a pas, pour percer les trous en question, suivi la procédure habituelle en utilisant comme gabarit le revêtement de l'aéronef. Au lieu de percer des avant-trous, il perça des trous pleine grandeur. Les trous percés dans le longeron n'étaient en conséquence pas alignés sur le revêtement.
[14]
Le défendeur avait plus d'expérience que M. Rowe, mais il ne l'a pas corrigé et n'a pas non plus signalé l'incident. D'autres collègues se trouvaient au même moment dans le hangar, mais ils n'ont ni entendu ni vu ce qui s'est passé.
[15]
Le 9 février 2011, M. Bob Strain, chef d'équipe (Structures), remarqua la malfaçon. Le 10 février 2011, M. Rowe, le défendeur, et trois collègues remirent des déclarations d'incident/danger, comme le prévoyait le système de déclarations anonymes des risques mis en place par la demanderesse. Le 17 février 2011, un autre collègue de travail remit lui aussi une déclaration d'incident/danger.
[16]
Le 17 février 2011, la demanderesse congédia le défendeur. La lettre de licenciement reproche au défendeur d'avoir, le 19 janvier 2011, percé dans le longeron d'un aéronef, des trous désalignés, une violation grave des règles de gestion de la sécurité. La lettre précise que l'incident était d'autant plus grave que le défendeur avait une expérience considérable du travail en question, et qu'il n'avait pas reconnu la gravité de son erreur. D'après la lettre, le défendeur avait déjà fait l'objet de plusieurs avertissements, tant par écrit que verbalement, concernant la qualité de son travail.
[17]
Le 6 mai 2011, le défendeur a déposé auprès de Développement des ressources humaines Canada une plainte pour congédiement injuste, en application de la partie III du
Code canadien du travail
.
[18]
Selon une ébauche de facture en date du 21 mars 2012, la demanderesse dut payer 10 666,73 $ pour corriger les dommages causés à l'aéronef (pièce 1, onglet 16).
[19]
L'audience devant l'arbitre a eu lieu le 22 mars 2012.
IV. DÉCISION VISÉE PAR LE CONTRÔLE JUDICIAIRE
[20]
Dans sa décision en date du 24 avril 2012, l'arbitre a conclu que le défendeur avait effectivement fait l'objet d'un congédiement injuste. L'arbitre a rappelé que c'est à la demanderesse qu'il appartenait de démontrer que le congédiement avait eu lieu pour un motif valable, précisant qu'il faut entendre par motif valable une inconduite grave nettement incompatible avec les fonctions dont l'employé était expressément ou implicitement chargé, ainsi que le risque que le maintien de l'employé dans ses fonctions cause un préjudice à l'employeur.
[21]
L'arbitre a estimé que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée de son fardeau de prouver que le congédiement du défendeur était justifié. Il a admis l'argument de la demanderesse voulant que l'erreur en question ait été constitutive d'une inconduite grave pouvant éventuellement entraîner des conséquences catastrophiques, et que la responsabilité de cette erreur incombait au défendeur, car c'est lui qui avait le plus d'expérience. Il a précisé que le défendeur n'était pas chef d'équipe, et que, M. Rowe mis à part, son expérience était comparable à celle des autres employés. Il a également observé que, selon le rapport d'incident remis par M. Strain, deux trous seulement étaient mal alignés sur l'aile que le défendeur avait aidé M. Rowe à réparer, précisant que, selon presque tous les rapports, les dommages en question étaient « mineurs ». L'arbitre a conclu que la demanderesse tentait de rejeter la faute sur le défendeur au lieu d'assumer ses responsabilités puisqu'elle n'avait pas surveillé comme elle aurait dû le travail de M. Rowe.
[22]
S'agissant des dommages-intérêts, l'arbitre a rappelé que l'indemnité que peut accorder un arbitre ne se limite pas à celle qui peut être réclamée en vertu de la common law, se basant pour cela sur l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . L'arbitre a relevé les dates auxquelles le défendeur a réussi à obtenir du travail à forfait, et les congés qu'il a dû demander au cours de cette période de travail. Il a souligné également que le défendeur avait suivi un programme d'apprentissage pour se recycler dans le métier de soudeur. Il a également précisé que le défendeur avait, pour augmenter son revenu, effectué des heures supplémentaires, son revenu annuel devenant alors presque égal à celui qu'il aurait touché en travaillant pour la demanderesse. L'arbitre a constaté que le défendeur était resté environ 21 jours sans travail, notant également une différence au niveau de sa rémunération horaire. Il a accordé au défendeur trois mois de salaire, soit 17 556 $ moins les retenues légales, ainsi que 500 $ au titre des dépens.
V. LES ARGUMENTS DE LA DEMANDERESSE
[23]
Selon la demanderesse, c'est à tort que l'arbitre n'a pas analysé le comportement du défendeur en tenant compte du contexte et du principe de la proportionnalité conformément à l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , de la Cour suprême du Canada, c'est-à-dire en tenant compte de la nature et des circonstances de l'inconduite, et de la mesure dans laquelle cette inconduite pourrait se concilier avec la relation employeur-employé.
[24]
La demanderesse reproche ensuite à l'arbitre de ne pas avoir examiné l'inconduite du défendeur eu égard aux diverses mesures disciplinaires dont il avait auparavant fait l'objet. L'arbitre n'a fait référence qu'aux deux incidents où le défendeur s'était servi de son téléphone portable dans le hangar. Or, le défendeur avait fait l'objet d'autres mesures disciplinaires, y compris, en juin 2008, pour ne pas avoir terminé son travail à temps.
[25]
Troisièmement, la demanderesse affirme que c'est à tort que l'arbitre n'a pas tenu compte du contexte que forment l'industrie du transport aérien et les directives strictes qui la régissent. Il invoque la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 131 et 143, affaire dans laquelle a été jugé injustifié le congédiement d'un employé qui avait endommagé un panneau de plancher et tenté de dissimuler les dommages.
[26]
La demanderesse fait valoir en l'espèce que l'arbitre n'a pas traité de l'industrie du transport aérien, rappelant simplement que deux trous seulement étaient mal alignés et que presque toutes les formules de déclaration d'incident tenaient pour mineurs les dommages en question.
[27]
Enfin, la demanderesse fait valoir que l'arbitre n'a pas pris en compte la malhonnêteté du défendeur. Selon elle, s'en tenant à l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , les tribunaux exigent qu'il soit tenu compte de la nature et du degré de malhonnêteté lorsqu'il s'agit de décider si celle-ci peut se concilier avec le maintien de la relation employeur-employé. L'arbitre a admis que c'est le défendeur qui avait percé les trous dans le longeron et qu'il avait aidé M. Rowe à percer des trous.
[28]
La demanderesse soutient par ailleurs que c'est à tort que l'arbitre n'a pas déduit de l'indemnité accordée les sommes qu'a gagnées le défendeur, sommes qui ont atténué l'ampleur du préjudice subi. Selon elle, l'arbitre semble avoir fondé le montant de l'indemnité sur le fait que le salaire horaire touché par le défendeur comme soudeur était inférieur au salaire horaire qu'il touchait lorsqu'il travaillait pour la demanderesse, et sur le fait que le défendeur a atténué l'ampleur de ses pertes en effectuant des heures supplémentaires.
[29]
La demanderesse soutient qu'il s'agit d'une erreur, car selon la jurisprudence, un employé doit être indemnisé des pertes effectivement subies, alors que le défendeur n'a en l'occurrence pas subi de pertes. D'après elle, le fait de ne pas avoir déduit le revenu perçu après le congédiement va à l'encontre des dispositions du
Code canadien du travail
, dont l'objet n'est pas de faire réaliser un gain inattendu à un employé qui s'est trouvé un travail mieux rémunéré. Elle invoque, à l'appui de son argument, la décision
Première nation de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 52.
VI. DISCUSSION ET DÉCISION
[30]
La demanderesse conteste à la fois le fait que l'arbitre ait conclu à un congédiement injuste et l'indemnité accordée au défendeur, en l'occurrence trois mois de salaire et la somme de 500 $ au titre des dépens. La conclusion de congédiement injuste est une question mixte de fait et de droit susceptible de contrôle judiciaire selon la norme du caractère raisonnable de la décision: voir l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 32. La question de la réparation accordée est elle aussi susceptible de contrôle judiciaire selon la norme du caractère raisonnable de la décision; voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 34.
[31]
À mon avis, la conclusion de l'arbitre quant au congédiement injuste du défendeur est raisonnable compte tenu des preuves produites. La demanderesse fait essentiellement valoir que l'arbitre n'a tenu aucun compte du contexte dans lequel est survenu le congédiement du défendeur, et notamment de ses antécédents disciplinaires, de l'expérience qu'il avait par rapport à celle de M. Rowe, et des normes de sécurité en vigueur dans l'industrie du transport aérien.
[32]
J'estime que la décision en question et le contenu du recueil des pièces montrent bien que l'arbitre n'a pas ignoré ces éléments de preuve. L'arbitre s'est, de manière précise, référé à l'argument de la demanderesse concernant les conséquences graves qu'aurait éventuellement pu avoir l'erreur en question, ainsi qu'à l'argument selon lequel, compte tenu de sa plus longue expérience, le défendeur aurait dû agir différemment. Il a également évoqué les antécédents disciplinaires du défendeur, même s'il n'a pas parlé de l'incident de décembre 2009.
[33]
L'arbitre s'est également livré à une analyse raisonnable et contextuelle de l'inconduite alléguée. D'après les éléments de preuve dont disposait l'arbitre, le défendeur a été congédié pour avoir percé les trous en question. Je constate à la lecture de la décision de l'arbitre, que celui-ci a admis que M. Rowe avait reconnu avoir lui-même percé les trous et que le défendeur n'avait fait que tenir la perceuse en place. L'arbitre a, raisonnablement et à juste titre, souligné que tous les rapports d'incident, sauf un, tenaient les dommages en question pour « mineurs ». Ces rapports précisaient par ailleurs que le travail avait été effectué dans un délai serré.
[34]
La demanderesse affirme par ailleurs que l'arbitre n'a pas pris en compte la malhonnêteté du défendeur. J'estime, cependant, que l'argument n'est pas fondé. Le recueil des pièces ne contient rien qui tende à démontrer que le défendeur n'aurait pas admis sa faute. L'arbitre semble avoir reconnu que l'inconduite alléguée avait bien eu lieu dans le contexte de l'industrie du transport aérien. Le fait qu'il n'ait pas donné davantage d'explications concernant ce fait n'a pas pour effet de rendre sa décision déraisonnable. La décision en question répond au critère du « caractère raisonnable », car elle est transparente et se justifie au regard des preuves produites; voir l'arrêt
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47.
[35]
L'arbitre a raisonnablement conclu que la demanderesse ne s'était pas acquittée de son fardeau de démontrer que le renvoi du défendeur était justifié.
[36]
Quant à la question de la réparation, elle est aussi susceptible de contrôle judiciaire selon la norme du caractère raisonnable au regard des dispositions du Code.
[37]
Les pouvoirs de réparation de l'arbitre sont en l'espèce régis par le paragraphe 242(4) du
Code canadien du travail
. L'alinéa 242(4)
a
) autorise un arbitre à rendre une ordonnance enjoignant à l'employeur de payer au plaignant une indemnité équivalant au salaire qu'il aurait normalement gagné au cours de la période visée par le préavis. Selon l'alinéa 242(4)
c
), l'arbitre peut « prendre toute autre mesure qu'il juge équitable de lui [l'employeur] imposer et de nature à contrebalancer les effets du congédiement ou à y remédier ». La jurisprudence de la Cour fédérale et de la Cour d'appel fédérale insiste sur le fait que les arbitres possèdent de larges pouvoirs réparateurs qui leur permettent de « dédommager pleinement » l'employé injustement congédié; voir les arrêts
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[38]
La Cour fédérale a également jugé qu'il convient de distinguer entre les dommages-intérêts pour congédiement injuste et l'indemnité pour le temps que l'employé aurait normalement travaillé. La protection contre les congédiements sans motif valable repose sur le principe voulant que, d'après le Code, toute personne injustement licenciée doive être indemnisée, même si elle a reçu une indemnité de départ.
[39]
Dans le jugement
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge O'Keefe fait une distinction entre l'attribution de dommages-intérêts et le versement d'une indemnité de départ, adoptant en cela le raisonnement de l'arbitre J.M. Gordon dans la décision
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):
38 Il est clair que la demanderesse place sur le même pied l'attribution de dommages-intérêts et le versement d'une indemnité de départ. Je ne suis pas d'accord avec la demanderesse. Pour expliquer ma position, j'adopterai et j'appliquerai à l'instance le raisonnement de l'arbitre  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), en ce qui concerne les relations entre les dispositions du Code sur le congédiement et le congédiement injuste:
[...]
31. [...] Comme je l'ai déjà souligné, j'estime que le raisonnement de la Cour fédérale et des arbitres cités par le plaignant sont conformes à l'objet de cette partie du Code et à l'intention du Parlement exprimés dans la formulation du Code. Dans
MacDonald -and- Northern Thunderbird Air Ltd.
, [1995] C.L.A.D. Nº 551, l'arbitre a rejeté l'argument de l'employeur selon lequel il pouvait congédier un employé sans donner de motifs simplement en versant une indemnité de départ suffisante pour que le seul recours de l'employé soit d'intenter une action au civil. L'arbitre a rejeté cet argument dans les termes suivants:
Si un employeur congédie un employé et lui verse une indemnité de départ sans motiver le congédiement, l'employé ne perd pas pour autant le droit de soutenir qu'il a été congédié injustement. Si c'était le cas, alors l'intention du Parlement exprimée à l'article 240 du Code, soit offrir un recours aux employés qui ont été congédiés injustement, serait contournée par les employeurs qui n'auraient qu'à verser l'indemnité de départ prévue par l'article 235:
Si le Parlement avait voulu limiter les plaintes de congédiement injuste aux personnes congédiées auxquelles on justifie le congédiement, il l'aurait énoncé clairement à l'article 240 et aurait soumis l'application de l'article 240 à celle de l'article 235 (page 2).
[40]
Un raisonnement analogue a récemment été suivi par le juge O'Reilly dans le jugement
Énergie atomique du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Les réparations pouvant être accordées en vertu des dispositions du
Code canadien du travail
a été évoquée ainsi par le juge Nadon dans
Première nation de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53:
L'arbitre qui accorde des dommages-intérêts pour congédiement injuste peut en fixer le montant. Ces dommages-intérêts visent à indemniser l'employé des dommages que lui a effectivement causés son congédiement. Bien qu'il puisse exercer un certain pouvoir discrétionnaire en fixant le montant des dommages-intérêts, l'arbitre commet une erreur lorsqu'il en limite le montant au montant de l'indemnité de départ à laquelle l'employé aurait droit en vertu de l'article 235 ou de la common law, si son congédiement avait été justifié.
[41]
Le juge Nadon s'est fondé sur l'arrêt
Alberta Wheat Pool
. Dans son ouvrage
The Law of Dismissal in Canada
, 3e éd. à feuilles mobiles (consulté le 26 juillet 2013), Toronto: Canada Law Book, 2003), ch. 2, aux pages 125 et 126, Howard Levitt souligne que, dans le contexte du
Code canadien du travail
, [traduction] « dans la plupart des cas de congédiement injuste, les dommages-intérêts tenant lieu de préavis raisonnable constituent une indemnité suffisante lorsque la réintégration n'est pas demandée ou n'est pas indiquée ». Il rappelle que l'octroi de dommages-intérêts a pour but de remettre la partie lésée dans une situation qui serait autant que possible celle dans laquelle elle se serait trouvée si le contrat avait été respecté.
[42]
L'arbitre a abordé la question des dommages-intérêts et a évoqué l'arrêt
Alberta Wheat Pool
au paragraphe 20 de sa sentence:
[traduction]
S'agissant de la question des dommages-intérêts tenant lieu de préavis, le juge Iacobucci, alors juge en chef de la Cour d'appel fédérale, a fait observer ce qui suit dans l'arrêt [
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : « Nous sommes également d'avis que l'alinéa 61.5(9)
a
) du
Code canadien du travail
[...] ne peut être interprété [restrictivement] de manière à limiter l'indemnité qu'un arbitre peut accorder à un employé au montant qui pourrait être réclamé en application de la common law. »
[43]
L'arbitre a ensuite évoqué de manière détaillée les efforts qu'a mis le défendeur après son congédiement pour se trouver du travail, précisant qu'il avait subi une baisse de salaire et s'était assuré un complément de revenu en faisant des heures supplémentaires. Il a ajouté que le défendeur avait été sans travail pendant à peu près 21 jours. Il a conclu en lui accordant la somme de 17 556 $, c'est-à-dire trois mois de salaire tenant lieu de préavis. La lecture des motifs de l'arbitre, pris dans leur ensemble, démontre que dans le calcul de cette indemnité, il s'est fondé sur l'arrêt
Alberta Wheat Pool
.
[44]
Le défendeur travaillait depuis plus de quatre ans pour la demanderesse. Bien que la rémunération que lui procurait son nouvel emploi était, de prime abord, égale à celle qu'il aurait touchée si la demanderesse ne l'avait pas injustement congédié, le défendeur a dû, pour se procurer un revenu équivalent, effectuer davantage d'heures de travail, y compris des heures supplémentaires. Compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances et des principes juridiques applicables, l'indemnité accordée par l'arbitre était raisonnable.
[45]
Il n'y a donc pas lieu pour la Cour d'intervenir, et la demande sera rejetée.
[46]
Reste la question des dépens. Hormis son dépôt d'un avis de comparution, le défendeur n'a pas pris part à la présente instance. En matière de dépens, le paragraphe 400(1) confère à la Cour un pouvoir discrétionnaire complet et il dispose:
400. (1) La Cour a le pouvoir discrétionnaire de déterminer le montant des dépens, de les répartir et de désigner les personnes qui doivent les payer.
400. (1) The Court shall have full discretionary power over the amount and allocation of costs and the determination of by whom they are to be paid.
[47]
Compte tenu des circonstances de la présente affaire et du fait que le défendeur n'a pas répondu de manière concrète à la présente demande, ne faisant que déposer un avis de comparution, en vertu de mon pouvoir discrétionnaire, je n'adjugerai aucuns dépens.
JUGEMENT
[48]
LA COUR STATUE que
la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée et, en vertu de mon pouvoir discrétionnaire, je n'adjuge aucuns dépens.
