MacKay, J.
: The appellant, Grace Kar Yan Cheung, appeals the decision of Citizenship Judge Herbert Ronald Patterson, dated February 22, 1989, in which he declined to approve Dr. Cheung's application for citizenship made under s. 5(1) of the Citizenship Act, now R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29.
[2]
The issue involved in the appeal concerns the assessment of residence in Canada within the four years immediately preceding the date of application pursuant to s. 5(1)(c) of the Act. In this case the appellant spent considerable time out of Canada in the relevant period, completing medical studies begun abroad before she was admitted as a permanent resident to Canada upon arrival here with others in her family.
[3]
In his decision Judge Patterson specifically notes his finding that the appellant had met all of the requirements for citizenship set out in the Citizenship Act except for that of residence. His decision also includes the statement that "I am satisfied that you had established a home or a place of abode in Canada at your sister's home on August 14, 1984" (by letter on file Judge Patterson subsequently amended this date to be October 14, 1984, the date he had actually intended).
[4]
The grounds of appeal are that the citizenship judge erred in law and in fact in assessing the appellant's accumulation of time of residence in Canada, pursuant to the three-out-of-four year residency requirement of s. 5, particularly as it is submitted he had "found as a fact that I had established a residence in Canada after I was admitted as a permanent resident".
[5]
At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant, her father Chak Chuen Jason Cheung, and her eldest sister Christine Cheung testified. Counsel on behalf of the appellant was heard, as was counsel serving as amicus curiae. While the hearing of an appeal under the Act is substantially a trial de novo, the evidence on the record before Judge Patterson was available to the court and implicitly relied upon by counsel except for findings of the judge relating to accumulated residence time in Canada which were in issue. The evidence on the record was supplemented by testimony at the appeal hearing, principally concerning the intentions and the ties of family members in their relationships with one another and with Canada.
[6]
In his letter of February 22, 1989 to the appellant Grace Cheung, Judge Patterson set out the basis of his decision in the following terms:
"I found that you met all of the requirements for citizenship set out in the Citizenship Act, except for the requirements of residence ... Under ... the Act, an applicant is required to have accumulated at least three-years of residence in Canada within the four-years immediately preceding his or her application.
.....
"In this regard, I comment as follows:
1. You were legally landed in Canada on October 10, 1984 together with your father, Chak Chuen Jason Cheung, and your mother, Lee Chip To Cheung. You also became a permanent resident on the above date.
2. You had never been to Canada until the above date.
3. You physically resided at the home of your sister, Christine Kar Ling Cheung (and her husband Paul Chan) located at 131 Huntington Park Drive, Thornhill, Ontario, from Wednesday, October 10, 1984 to Sunday, October 14, 1984. I understand that your parents also physically resided at such home during the period and subsequently thereto for a time. Appropriate written evidence confirming the foregoing was filed with me.
4. In the Residence Questionnaire filed with your application for citizenship, you indicated that you resided at the following locations in Canada:

2802 - 1101 Bay St., Toronto, Ontario

5. On October 14, 1984, you left Toronto via air flight to return to Hong Kong to continue your medical studies leading to your being awarded the Degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery by the University of Hong Kong on November 26, 1987. During your absences from Canada, you physically resided at your father's apartment at 6 Princess Margaret Road, 3rd Floor, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

7. As indicated above, you initially remained in Canada for only four days (October 10, 1984 to October 14, 1984) and you were then absent from Canada for 799 days (October 14, 1984 to December 22, 1986).
8. Under the above Federal Court precedents, in order for you to count the above absences of 799 days (and indeed the later one), you were required to show that (1) you had established a home or place of abode in Canada and (2) you had, in mind and in fact, centralized your ordinary mode of living in Canada, both before your departure from Canada on October 14, 1984.
9. I am satisfied that you had established a home or place of abode in Canada at your sister's home on October 14, 1984 as set forth above.
10. With respect to centralizing your ordinary mode of living in Canada, the only things that you accomplished on the brief four day trip to Canada by October 14, 1984, were as follows:
(a) You completed and filed an application for your Social Insurance Number (which all landed immigrants are obligated to do);
(b) You joined your immediate family members mentioned above as well as your sister, Susanna Kar-Yee Cheung, and her husband Dominic Wong, and your niece, Carole Ling-Sum Chan, for a brief family reunion;
(c) You familiarized yourself with the local area to a limited degree;
(d) You shopped for some winter clothing; and
(e) You enquired at 'the universities' as to a possible transfer to a Canadian medical school.
"These facts lead me to conclude that your presence in Canada from October 10, 1984 to October 14, 1984 and from December 22, 1986 to March 7, 1987 were only visits or temporary stays. This is insufficient to consider that you centralized your ordinary mode of living within the relevant period and therefore your absences from Canada from October 14, 1984 to December 22, 1986 and from March 7, 1987 to May 22, 1988 cannot be counted as periods of residence in Canada. I am supported in this conclusion by the case law contained in the cases listed in Schedule 'A' annexed hereto."
(Note: The date October 14, 1984 is as subsequently amended by Judge Patterson.)
[7]
Testimony adduced at the appeal hearing dealt with certain circumstances of this case which had not been emphasized by the citizenship judge. Among these were the following:
1. The appellant, her father, her mother and a sister Susanna had all been admitted as permanent residents to Canada at the same time, on October 10, 1984, all of them being sponsored by the eldest daughter of the family, Christine Cheung, as members of a family unit under the Immigration Act.
2. The eldest daughter, Christine, had originally come to Canada from Hong Kong in 1972 to study, has since then become a citizen of Canada, has become well established in a career setting, as has her husband, and together they have acquired a home in Thornhill, Ontario. Within that home from October 10, 1984 to early in 1986 a room was maintained for the personal, exclusive use of the appellant Grace, and accommodation was provided, as their home, for her parents.
3. The appellant's sister Susanna had first come to Canada as a student in 1980 and is now a citizen, is married, and her husband has status as a permanent resident, sponsored by his wife.
4. The appellant's father had visited Canada prior to 1972 and had planned from early visits to try to establish his family in this country. Those plans were accomplished, in a manner he said was not unusual for Chinese families, by one family member becoming a citizen and then sponsoring other family members to come to Canada. All of the family except the appellant had now attained citizenship in Canada and no immediate family members were left in Hong Kong. Since October 1984 the father and mother had spent all of their time in Canada except for visits to Hong Kong, the longest of which had been nearly eleven months in the father's case in 1985 when he was seeking to settle business matters there. Mr. Cheung's plans for the settlement of his family in Canada were also now realized in a practical sense, with two daughters now citizens, married and settled in their own homes, he and his wife having acquired an apartment of their own, and he having now acquired a second condominium apartment in Toronto for the appellant.
5. The appellant has considered her permanent residence to be in Canada since October 10, 1984, when she was admitted as a permanent resident. Until that time she had lived with her parents in the family's apartment in Hong Kong. Since that time many of her personal effects and a piano she had subsequently shipped to Canada had remained in her room, first at her sister's home in Thornhill from October 1984 until early 1986, then in an apartment rented by her father for her parents and herself and later in a condominium apartment he had acquired as a home for the parents and the appellant, and most recently in a condominium apartment obtained for her by her father. At the time of her landing as a permanent resident in 1984, and indeed since then, the appellant was dependant upon her father and her family for her welfare and support, and particularly from 1984 to 1988 in completing medical studies and hospital training in Hong Kong she was fully dependant upon her family. While completing her studies in Hong Kong she had lived in an apartment of her father's which had been maintained to facilitate her studies.
6. The appellant had begun her medical studies in Hong Kong before permission had been granted for her admission to Canada as landed immigrant. She completed her third and fourth year of studies and her medical internship in Hong Kong after being admitted to Canada as a permanent resident. Her admission was on a visa with a limited term, the opportunities to complete medical studies in Canada by transfer from Hong Kong in 1984 appeared after enquiry to be nonexistent, and she had decided to complete her degree and internship in Hong Kong as a long term personal and family goal. She had spent some time in Canada from December 1986 to March 1987 as part of her intern program, the only portion that could be completed here for her Hong Kong medical qualification. The extended periods abroad after October 1984 were necessitated by her continuing medical studies on a year-round curriculum for third and fourth years and for intern service.
7. On each occasion when she had been in Canada and was proposing to return to Hong Kong for further studies, or, since the decision of Judge Patterson, for a visit, she had obtained from Immigration Canada a permit for reentry as a resident of Canada.
8. While there were few of the usual indicia of continuing ties with Canada throughout the period she had been abroad, such as maintenance of a personal bank account or of public health insurance registration, or of membership in Canadian clubs or professional organizations, a number of these ties were now in existence. Some of these appear to have been effected since the date of her application for citizenship, others like her bank account were established when she was in Canada in 1986-87.
9. The appellant hoped to be able to establish a professional career in Canada, in the practice of medicine if her application for necessary internship in this country were accepted, or in related health professional work after further studies in health administration for which she had applied for admission to the University of Toronto.
[8]
Counsel for the appellant submitted that lack of some normal indicia of continuing ties with Canada was not unusual for one who continues a role as a student while abroad, virtually dependant for support upon her parents. Counsel further urged that this family's plans for coming to Canada, the fact that four of them were accorded permanent residence status at the same time upon their sponsorship as a family unit by the elder daughter, and that all of them, except the appellant, had been granted citizenship before this appeal was heard - all these factors it was urged should weigh heavily in this case. Counsel suggested that these factors, and the facts that prior to 1984 the appellant had lived at home with her parents and from 1984 on she continued to be fully dependant upon her family, in particular upon her parents for her welfare and support, ought to have been considered rather than concentrating, as Judge Patterson had here done, exclusively on factors relating to the determination of residence of the appellant as though she were a completely independent person. Here it was urged that consideration be given to the establishment of residence by the parents upon whom the appellant continued to be dependant for her welfare and support, and whose home she considered to be hers also, throughout the time from 1984 when the family was seeking to become established in Canada.
[9]
In these circumstances counsel submitted that decisions relating to the establishment of intention concerning residence for an independent person, relied upon by Judge Patterson, were less helpful than decisions dealing with residence of persons who carried on as students studying abroad after the grant of permanent residence. Decisions of particular interest urged by counsel for the appellant were Re Papadogiorgakis, [1978] 2 F.C. 209 (F.C.T.D.), per Thurlow, A.C.J., and Re Man (unreported, August 18, 1986, court file no. T-2707-85 (F.C.T.D.)), per Joyal, J.
[10]
Counsel serving as amicus curiae conceded that in this case the appellant was dependant upon her parents at all material times, that she appeared to be one who would be a good citizen and one highly qualified as a graduate medical doctor, and that there was no question here of her intention to return to Canada throughout the periods of continuing studies abroad after October 1984. He submitted that while there was here an absence of the usual indicia of continuing ties to Canada once a pied-à-terre had been established, which were considered in other cases as objective evidence of intention about residence, that might well be considered to be compensated for by evidence of continuing strong family ties, of reestablishment of the family as a unit in Canada and of a continuing situation of dependency of the appellant upon her family. Less easily resolved, in his view, was the issue of whether the appellant was resident in Canada within s. 5(1) of the Act after admission for permanent residence, an issue to be resolved by the court.
[11]
There are several passages from existing jurisprudence which I find to be of assistance. Collier, J., in Chan Quin Yu (unreported, January 21, 1985, court file no. T-1578-84, at pp. 5 and 6) said:
"The statute envisages that persons who have been admitted for permanent residence may leave Canada, for shorter or longer periods, and still be considered as residing in this country during those absences. For that, the applicant, while away, must maintain in Canada some real and tangible form of residence, or residential base. It must be a place which he considers as his home or residence, to which he will eventually return; a physical base to which he could return at any reasonable time.
.....
"Residence is not to be determined, at the outset, by mathematical calculations, as was done in this case. One first must determine whether there has been 'residence' in law, and for what period of time. A pure arithmetic calculation of days of physical presence in, or absence from, Canada, is not the criteria."
Dubé, J., In re Secretary of State of Canada and Abi-Zeid (1983), 4 D.L.R. (4th) 664, said:
"The fundamental principles which emerge from decisions in this area are that it is not necessary to be physically and continuously present in Canada throughout the required period. However, a person who is physically absent must first, before his absence, have established residence in Canada, and must then in some way continue his residence in Canada while he is absent abroad."
Joyal, J., in Sebastian Shi-Wai Man, supra, said:
"As I read these cases, physical presence in Canada is not required to establish the residency requirements under the Act. What must be gleaned from all the evidence is the finding of an intention to return and, a contrario, no abandonment of Canadian residency.
.....
"The extended meaning given to the residency rule is well-established and I should be loathe to infect it with more commentary. I must keep in mind that in accordance with the dictum of Walsh, J., in the matter of Re Kleifges (1978), 84 D.L.R.(3d) 183, the provisions of the Citizenship Act should be given a liberal interpretation especially when, as in so many cases, an applicant would otherwise make an excellent citizen ..."
Finally, in addition to these cases and Re Papadogiorgakis, referred to by counsel for the appellant, the decisions in this court of Jerome, A.C.J., in In re Citizenship Act and In re Wellhausen (unreported, October 22, 1985, court file no. T-849-84) and of McNair, J., in Re Kelly (1990), 32 F.T.R. 241 (F.C.T.D.), are helpful in their treatment of residence requirements under s. 5(1) of the Act in cases where the person granted landing as a permanent resident subsequently spends considerable time abroad.
[12]
The arithmetic calculation of the appellant's presence in and absences from Canada highlights the questionable features of this case. After her landing as a permanent resident on October 10, 1984 the appellant was present in Canada for four days until October 14, for 75 days from December 1986 to March 1987 and for two days in May 1988, a total of 81 days in all, prior to her application for citizenship. In the same period she was absent from Canada continuing her studies for two extended periods totalling 1,240 days, as documented by Judge Patterson. These facts and the limited evidence of established ties with Canada in accord with the usual indicia of such ties, led to the judge's conclusion that the appellant's presence in Canada, prior to her application for citizenship, had been "only visits or temporary stays" and that, although she had established "a home or place of abode in Canada on October 14, 1984" she had not established residence in Canada within s. 5(1) of the Act.
[13]
The decision of a citizenship judge warrants respect particularly in a case that might be determined either way but where there is evidence available on appeal that clearly supports an alternative finding that is consistent with the Act and it purposes the practice of this court has been to allow appeals of individuals applying for citizenship. In my view that practice supports a conclusion that in the circumstances here this appeal should be allowed.
[14]
In Sebastian, supra, where the applicant had been present in Canada for nine days following landing as a permanent resident, was then absent for long periods assisting his father's business interests in Hong Kong and subsequently completing studies at Harvard, the court upheld the grant of citizenship and dismissed an appeal by the Secretary of State. There a number of factors were referred to by my colleague Joyal, J., as the basis of determination by the citizenship judge, factors for the most part present also in this case, including the applicant's previous consistent record of residence with his or her family, the establishment of residence in Toronto by a daughter and her husband in which residence was provided for the parents and the applicant, the maintenance of the applicant's personal effects and household goods other than clothing in the family residence in Canada whenever absent from the country, and the obtaining of Returning Resident Permits when absent from Canada.
[15]
In addition to these factors it seems to me that consistent with her continuing studies the appellant here did all that would ordinarily be expected of one who had until then lived with her family in her parents' home, and who continued to be dependant upon her parents and her family for welfare and support, to establish residence with them in Canada following landing as a permanent resident. Her admission to Canada as a permanent resident was not conditional on her remaining physically present in Canada for any particular time, and it did not require that she abandon medical studies already begun in Hong Kong in order for that status to be retained. Indeed, she obtained her first permit for reentry as a resident on October 11, 1984, the day after her landing as a permanent resident. It seems clear it was implicitly understood by immigration officers upon her arrival in Canada that she would be returning to Hong Kong to complete her medical studies. Her absences from Canada after October 14, 1984 were exclusively related to completion of those studies both for her medical degree and for practical in-hospital training for her Hong Kong medical qualifications.
[16]
In the circumstances of this case I conclude that the appellant was admitted to Canada as a permanent resident together with her parents, that she did nothing to abandon that status and indeed did all that would ordinarily be expected of one who was still dependant upon her parents and continuing studies abroad to establish residence here with her family, that she intended to return to Canada upon completion of those studies, and this she did. In my view she was resident in Canada within s. 5(1) of the Act from the date of her landing in October 1984, and that residence was not interrupted by her absences abroad to complete her studies.
[17]
Thus, this appeal is allowed and the appropriate grant of citizenship should follow.
Appeal allowed.
