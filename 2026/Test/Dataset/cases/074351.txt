Nadon, J.
: This is an appeal by Kem-A-Trix (Lubricants) Inc. (the "appellant") from an Order rendered on July 10, 1996, by Richard Morneau, Prothonotary. By his order, the Prothonotary dismissed the appellant's application to strike the originating notice of motion filed by Tom Pac Inc. (the "respondent").
[2]
On February 2, 1996, the Registrar of Trademarks, under number 453,606, registered, at the request of the appellant, the trade name "TP2431" to be used in relation to industrial lubricants. When the respondent became aware of the registration, it filed its originating notice of motion to obtain the expungement of the trademark and, further, to obtain an injunction against the appellant.
[3]
The appellant then sought to obtain an order striking the respondent's originating notice on the ground that an application to expunge, made under s. 57 of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, could not be made by way of an originating notice of motion where the applicant sought injunctive relief in addition to the expungement of the trademark. The correct procedure in such a case would be to proceed by way of statement of claim. The appellant claimed that, since the respondent had used the wrong originating document, the respondent's notice of originating motion should be struck as an abuse of process and/or lack of jurisdiction.
[4]
Following service of the appellant's motion to strike, the respondent's counsel advised the appellant's counsel that he was prepared to withdraw that part of his originating notice of motion which sought injunctive relief. However, that proposal was not acceptable to counsel for the appellant and, as a result, the appellant's motion to strike was argued before the Prothonotary on the l7th of June 1996.
[5]
At the hearing, the Prothonotary allowed the respondent to amend its originating notice of motion so as, in effect, to abandon the request for an injunction. Leave to amend was given pursuant to rule 303. In support of his decision to grant leave to the respondent, the Prothonotary relied on the decision of my colleague, MacKay, J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), and more particularly in that part of his reasons where he stated, at pages 121-122:
"For the respondent it is urged that these rules, 421 and 422, concern pleadings in actions in the court, commenced by statement of claim, as defined by rule 2 which provides, in part:
'"action" means a proceeding in the Trial Division other than an appeal, an application or an originating motion, and includes such a proceeding by or against the Crown or any person acting for or on behalf of the Crown;
. . . . .
'"pleading" means any document whereby an action in the Trial Division was initiated or a claim in such an action was defined, and any document, whereby a claim was defended or answered, and includes a confession of judgment and a discontinuance.'
"I agree that those
Rules
relate to actions in the court, and this proceeding by an application under s. 44(1) of the
Act
is not an action.
"I do not agree with the implication of the respondent's submission on this point, that the court, even in an appropriate case, may not allow an amendment to an application or a Notice of Motion. While the court's
Rules
have no counterparts, for applications, to rules 420 to 428 which concern amendments to pleadings in actions, rule 303 is a general provision for amendments of any document except a judgment or order. It provides:
'303(1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy, or of correcting any defect of [sic] error, the court may, at any stage of a proceeding, and after giving all interested parties an opportunity to be heard, order any document in the matter to be amended on such terms as seems just, and in such manner as it may direct.
'(2) This rule does not apply to a judgment or order.'
"In my view, rule 303 provides a basis for the court, in an appropriate case, to admit amendments to applications, particularly in light of rule 2(2) which sets out the general purpose of the rule as
'... intended to render effective the substantive law and to ensure that it is carried out; and they are to be so interpreted and applied as to facilitate rather than to delay or to end prematurely the normal advancement of cases.'"
[6]
As a result of his decision to allow the amendment sought by the respondent, the Prothonotary dismissed the appellant's motion to strike. Further, the Prothonotary allowed costs in favour of the respondent. The appellant appeals the Prothonotary's order on the following grounds:
"1. Pursuant to the provisions of sections 57 and 58 of the
Trade-marks Act
, an application for expungement of a trademark may only be made by statement of claim if the application seeks additional relief. The Petitioner's Requête en radiation d'enregistrement de marque de commerce, in which the Petitioner requested, in addition to expungement, injunctive relief, was taken by way of originating notice of motion. Want of jurisdiction is a ground for dismissal, on summary application to the court, of any proceeding improperly brought before the court (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 135 and 136). Accordingly, the Petitioner's originating notice of motion ought to have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction 'ratione materiae'.
"2. Litigation proceedings are simply proper or improper at the time they are instituted. (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  fundamental issue of jurisdiction of the court to entertain the application as drafted and grant the relief sought, subsequent modification of the original application cannot cure the impropriety and make valid that which had no legal validity in the first place. It is a question of absolute nullity in consequence of the provisions of the applicable statute.
"3. The Petitioner's Requête en radiation d'enregistrement de marque de commerce, taken by way of originating notice of motion constituted an abuse of the process of the court since it was taken by way of originating notice of motion rather than by statement of claim, as required. (see
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 190).
"4. In response to the respondent's Notice of Motion to Strike, the Petitioner served on the respondent's solicitor a Requête amendée en radiation d'enregistrement de marque de commerce dated June 14, 1996, presumably pursuant to the provisions of rules 420 and 421. The Petitioner is not entitled to proceed in such manner since an originating notice is clearly not a
pleading
as defined in rule 2. In order to amend its originating notice, the Petitioner would have had to apply for permission to amend pursuant to rule 303, which, the prothonotary indicates in his order, the Petitioner did orally at the time of presentation of the motion to strike. (For the reasons cited above, this oral motion ought not to have been granted.)
"5. Though not forming a basis for his decision, the prothonotary alluded to the issue of whether or not a motion to strike could properly be brought against an originating notice of motion. This question seems to have decided in the affirmative especially by operation of the gap rule. (In this case, reference is made to the provisions of Articles 75.1, 166(4), 813, etc. of the
Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec.
) (see, inter alia,
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 462 and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 54).
"6. Whatever the outcome of its Motion to Strike, the respondent was entitled to an order for costs on its application, since the application was clearly well founded when made. Similarly, the respondent was entitled to costs on the Petitioner's motion to file a new affidavit which was granted only in part, after contestation. Moreover the respondent is entitled to costs on a solicitor-client basis given the complexity of the issues involved on the Motion to Strike." (Citations amended)
[7]
In my view, this appeal cannot succeed. Counsel for the appellant argued in his grounds of appeal and before me that the Prothonotary misapprehended the law regarding initiating documents. Counsel for the appellant took the view that, because the incorrect initiating document was used, this court loses its jurisdiction and the entire originating notice of motion must therefore be struck. I cannot agree with this argument. First, it is clear that, pursuant to the
Act
, this court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the proceeding. Second, while this court cannot grant injunctive relief to an applicant on the basis of an originating notice of motion, this court can certainly deal with an application for the expungement of a trademark on that basis. In deciding to dismiss the appellant's motion to strike and allowing the respondent to amend his originating notice of motion so as to bring it into conformity with the requirements of the
Act
, I find that the Prothonotary's exercise of discretion was not based on a wrong principle.
[8]
With respect to his fifth ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant argued the question of whether or not a motion to strike could properly be brought against an originating notice of motion. Counsel for the appellant argued before me that this has been decided in the affirmative with reference to rule 5 of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663, (the so-called 'gap' rule). I indicated at the hearing that I was of the view that this court has the necessary jurisdiction to strike an originating notice of motion. This jurisdiction stems from the court's inherent jurisdiction over its own proceedings and does not derive from operation of the gap rule. I note that, while there may well be circumstances in which an originating notice of motion must be struck, I concur with the Prothonotary that those circumstances do not exist in the present matter.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal was concerned with an appeal from a decision of Noël, J., who had refused to strike the respondent's originating notice of motion. In dismissing the appeal, Mr. Justice Strayer, for the court, made the following statement at pages 54 and 55:
"For these reasons we are satisfied that the trial judge properly declined to make an order striking out, under rule 419 or by means of the gap rule, as if this were an action. This is not to say that there is no jurisdiction in this court either inherent or through rule 5 by analogy to other rules, to dismiss in summary manner a notice of motion which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success. (See e.g.
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 120-121 F.C. (T.D.)). Such cases must be very exceptional and cannot include cases such as the present where there is simply a debatable issue as to the adequacy of the allegations in the notice of motion."
[9]
Thus the Prothonotary concluded that in the circumstances of the case at bar, the appellant's motion to strike had to be dismissed. In my view, in reaching that conclusion, the learned Prothonotary did not base his exercise of discretion upon a wrong principle in allowing the respondent to withdraw its request for an injunction nor did he base his exercise of discretion upon a wrong principle in dismissing the appellant's motion to strike.
[10]
With respect to the costs issue, I am also of the view that the Prothonotary did not base his exercise of discretion upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts. The Prothonotary appears to have been of the view, although he did not expressly say so in his reasons, that the appellant should have accepted the respondent's offer to withdraw the request for an injunction. It cannot be said that the Prothonotary's decision regarding costs is one that cannot be justified and, consequently, is not one which ought to be disturbed.
[11]
This appeal shall be dismissed with costs in favour of the respondent.
Appeal dismissed.
