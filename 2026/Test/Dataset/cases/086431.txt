I.
Overview
[1]
Shore, J.
: Due to mischaracterization of fact based on confusion in respect of the Applicant's testimony, which led to the Refugee Protection Division's error of fact in its credibility findings, the Court does not find the decision is reasonable when assessed as a whole in context.
II.
Introduction
[2]
The Applicant seeks a judicial review of a decision by the RPD of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated November 6, 2012, wherein, it was determined that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under section 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001 c 27 [
IRPA
].
III.
Background
[3]
The Applicant, Mr. Aimé-Landry Ahishakiye, is a young Tutsi from Bujumbura, Burundi.
[4]
In early 2010, the Applicant became a student at the Hope Africa University. At the university, the Applicant indicates he made friends with a number of students who supported the National Forces of Liberation [NFL] political party of Burundi.
[5]
The Applicant explains that these students began pressuring him to join the party in April 2010. Despite declining numerous offers, they continued to pressure him to join for months.
[6]
In May 2010, the Applicant submitted a visa application to come to Canada to study at the University of Sherbrooke. This visa was denied as classes had already begun when his application was reviewed by the Canadian Embassy.
[7]
On September 24, 2010, the Applicant states that one of the students who had asked him to join the NFL approached him and demanded that the Applicant join the party, forcefully handing him a membership card. That same evening, the Applicant states he received a threatening telephone call from the same student and he continued receiving such calls until shortly before his departure to Canada.
[8]
On September 27, 2010, the Applicant stopped attending classes at the Hope Africa University. The Applicant states he feared leaving his home as a result of the threatening telephone calls.
[9]
On December 16, 2010, the Applicant received a student visa to study at the University of Sherbrooke. The Applicant subsequently left Burundi for Canada on December 29, 2010.
[10]
On January 5, 2011, the Applicant submitted a refugee claim in Etobicoke, Ontario. The Applicant did not attend the University of Sherbrooke after his arrival.
[11]
On November 6, 2012, the RPD rendered a decision that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.
IV.
Decision under Review
[12]
In its decision, the RPD determined that the Applicant was not credible and that he had not established a serious possibility of persecution or that he would be personally subject to a risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Burundi.
[13]
In assessing the Applicant's credibility, the RPD found it implausible that the Applicant's parents would have taken the matter "lightly", as testified by the Applicant, when informed by their 19 year old son that he was being threatened by other students.
[14]
The RPD noted that his parents would have reasonably been expected to have contacted the school administration where their son had experienced the recruitment efforts of the NFL. The RPD found that this lack of action on the part of the Applicant's parents greatly put into question the credibility of his testimony.
[15]
In addition to its finding regarding the credibility of the Applicant, the RPD noted that the objective evidence on file did not demonstrate that he fit the profile of those generally targeted by the NFL, or that the party was engaged in recruiting members against their will. The RPD therefore concluded that objective evidence did not establish the existence of a serious possibility of persecution or risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.
V.
Issue
[16]
Is the RPD's decision reasonable?
VI.

VII.
Position of the Parties
[18]
The Applicant raised various grounds to support his position that the RPD's decision is not reasonable, all of which are related to how the RPD assessed the evidence on file.
[19]
Firstly, the Applicant contends that the RPD erred in misconstruing his testimony. The Applicant states that the RPD confused two conversations he had with his parents regarding the actions of the NFL towards him; his initial conversation with regard to being approached by members of the NFL, and the second, a conversation in which he revealed he had been threatened by them.
[20]
The Applicant submits that in misconstruing this evidence and drawing a negative credibility finding from it, it is not possible to know for certain how the RPD would have judged the case otherwise.
[21]
The Applicant submits that the RPD also misconstrued the evidence on record regarding the recruitment pattern of the NFL. The Applicant states that the evidence in fact demonstrates that the NFL did rely on violence to recruit new members in 2010, primarily through youth partisans.
[22]
The Applicant further submits that the RPD erred in finding that his testimony regarding his parents' reaction to the threats made by the NFL was implausible. The Applicant states that he clearly testified that the university's security service was non-existent; therefore, his parents cannot have reasonably been expected to communicate with it regarding their son's safety. Moreover, the Applicant states that once the RPD accepted that the Police in Burundi were not reliable, there was no logical basis for the RPD to expect the Applicant to go to the university to resolve the problem.
[23]
Lastly, the Applicant argues that the RPD breached a principle of natural justice by basing its credibility findings on a doubt which was not put to the Applicant. Specifically, the Applicant states that the RPD erred in making a determination regarding the Applicant's father's political views without first asking him directly if he was a supporter of the CNDD-FCC.
[24]
The Respondent argues that the RPD was entitled to find that the Applicant's account of events was not credible, and did not err by ignoring evidence of the atrocities committed by the NFL in Burundi at that time. To the contrary, the Respondent submits that the RPD did not have any evidence before it to support the Applicant's claims of forcible and threatening recruitment efforts by the NFL.
[25]
The Respondent further submits that the RPD did not err in its assessment of the Applicant's evidence of his parents' reaction to the threats by the NFL. The Respondent argues that the Applicant's claim that the RPD confused the two conversations discussed by the Applicant in his testimony is self-serving and attempts to explain away the testimony that it questioned. Further, the Respondent asserts that the RPD was entitled to find it not credible that the Applicant would simply drop out of school without approaching authorities for assistance.
[26]
With regard to the Applicant's claim that the RPD breached a principle of fundamental justice, the Respondent submits that the RPD did not make a determination that his father was politically active, or that he was a CNDD-FDD partisan or supporter. The RPD simply found that he was in a position that was approved by the government in power.
VIII.
Standard of Review
[27]
The applicable standard for issues involving the RPD's weighing of evidence or findings of credibility is the standard of reasonableness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) at para 4).
[28]
The decision must therefore be justifiable, transparent and intelligible. It should be vacated only if it is perverse, capricious, not based on the evidence or based on an important mischaracterization of material facts (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
The Applicant also alleges that the RPD breached a principle of natural justice. The appropriate standard of review for issues involving procedural fairness and natural justice is the standard of correctness (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 46).
IX.
Analysis
[30]
In the Court's view, the Applicant has demonstrated that the RPD based its decision on a negative credibility finding that was made due to confusion in respect of the testimony, and, thus, on the basis of the narrative, itself.
[31]
In its decision, the RPD relied largely on the Applicant's account of his parents' reaction regarding the threats by the NFL in determining that his story was not credible. The RPD concluded:
[18] Le demandeur a expliqué qu'il ne s'était pas adressé à la police parce que la police n'est pas fiable. Il est évident au regard de la preuve documentaire que la population n'accorde aucune confiance aux forces de sécurité. Le tribunal considère raisonnable que le demandeur se soit abstenu de faire appel à la police.
[19] Cependant,
lorsque le tribunal a demandé au demandeur s'il avait tenu ses parents au courant des pressions exercées sur lui pour qu'il rejoigne le FNL, le demandeur a répondu que oui, mais que ses parents avaient pris ses révélations à la légère
. Le tribunal juge peu probable, voire invraisemblable, que les parents du demandeur aient pris à la légère les révélations du demandeur que le FNL cherchait à le recruter contre son gré. Le demandeur lui-même a insisté dans son exposé circonstancié qu'il avait ressenti de l'inquiétude face à la possibilité d'être mépris par les forces de sécurité pour un membre du FNL, un mouvement que le demandeur qualifie de mouvement rebelle dans son exposé circonstancié. [Emphasis added].
[32]
As described above, the Applicant asserts that the RPD, inadvertently confused two separate conversations he had with his parents to arrive at this conclusion. Conversely, in its memorandum, the Respondent argues that these two conversations are one and the same event, and that the Applicant is merely attempting to invent a temporal distinction in the facts.
[33]
The Court cannot agree with the Respondent's suggestion. As it clearly appears from the transcript of the hearing (Certified Tribunal Record at pp 293-294) the Applicant recounted two distinct conversations with his parents regarding the threats received by the NFL. It is only after the RPD questioned the Applicant about the date he started receiving actual threats that the Applicant discussed his parents' reaction to those threats. The Applicant described his parents' reaction as being "very scared" and "in shock" [translated]. The Court refers to the passage in question from the transcript:
PRÉSIDENTE
: Vous aviez quoi? Dix-huit ans?
DEMANDEUR
: J'avais, oui, à l'époque j'avais 18 ans.
PRÉSIDENTE
: Vous en avez parlé à vos parents de vos problèmes?
DEMANDEUR
: Oui. Donc à l'époque, donc, c'était pas des problèmes. Donc tout simplement j'ai parlé à mes parents: « Ah, vous savez quoi? Il y a des personnes qui me parlent de politique, du FNL ». Et donc mon père disait: « (Inaudible) du FNL? Pourquoi ils te parlent? » Et tout. Bon, moi je disais, bon, ils me parlent. Il me demandait donc: « Est-ce qu'ils te menacent? Est-ce que tu vois qu'il y a des signes de t'impliquer dedans? » Etc. Et donc moi je disais, bon, ils me parlent tout simplement du FNL. Donc ils discutent entre eux en parlant du CNDD, du FNL. Donc ils discutent en tous cas et donc moi j'ai pas beaucoup de trucs à dire parce que j'ai pas - j'ai pas vraiment de connaissances dans ce domaine-là et ... Donc ils ont pris ça à la légère quoi donc. Il n'y avait pas de menace, il y avait rien du tout. Donc ils étaient au courant de ça.
PRÉSIDENTE
: Mais le 24 septembre, là c'était quand même assez sérieux. C'est le soir même qu'on vous avez appelé pour vous menacer.
DEMANDEUR
: Oui, oui. Donc là, à partir ...
PRÉSIDENTE
: Vous en avez parlé à vos parents.
DEMANDEUR
: Oui, oui.
PRÉSIDENTE
: Et?
DEMANDEUR
: Donc quand - donc après la fin de cet appel-là donc j'ai déjà - donc tout simplement donc j'ai parlé à mes parents. Je leur ai dit que je viens de recevoir un appel et que j'avais reconnu un des étudiants qui avaient - qui étudiaient avec moi. Et donc il me disait que simplement j'allais regretter ma décision parce que j'avais pas pris la carte du parti qu'il m'avait donnée.
PRÉSIDENTE
: Quelle a été leur réaction ?
DEMANDEUR
: Ils ont eu très peur. Il ont été choqués.
[34]
The Court agrees with the Applicant that the RPD misconstrued the evidence provided in his testimony. It is clear in reading the transcript that the Applicant was attempting to recount his entire narrative to the RPD in his testimony, but was not given the chance to do so. In his testimony, the Applicant not only referred to the incident that occurred on September 24, 2010, but also to the events that occurred before he was threatened. It is only after being interrupted and questioned by the RPD with regard to the telephone threats of September 24, 2010, that the Applicant mentioned his parents' reaction to those threats. Prior to this intervention by the RPD, the Applicant described his experience before the threats arose.
[35]
Due to mischaracterization of fact based on confusion in respect of the Applicant's testimony, which led to the RPD's error of fact in its credibility findings, the Court does not find the decision is reasonable when assessed as a whole in context.
[36]
The RPD relied primarily on this finding to justify its conclusion that the Applicant lacked credibility. The RPD undertook very little substantive analysis on the remainder of the evidence upon which the Applicant's claim of a well-founded fear relied, although the documentary evidence submitted by the Applicant reasonably supported his claim of fear from youth NFL members in Burundi.
[37]
As stated by this Court in
Canada (Minister of Public Safety and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  "a reasonable result will not save a decision that is devoid of adequate reasons where there is a duty to give reasons and where the reasons cannot be augmented by regard to the record" (at para 10) (Reference is also made to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  save the decision. Even if the RPD found some evidence not to be credible, it was required to continue go on to consider whether there remained a residuum of reliable evidence to support a well-founded fear of persecution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This is particularly true in the present case where the evidence found not credible was only related to peripheral issues.
[39]
Given that this factor, in and of itself, is determinative of the matter, the Court does not see a need to address the other grounds raised by the Applicant.
X.
Conclusion
[40]
For all of the above-noted reasons, the Applicant's application for judicial review is allowed.
JUDGMENT
[41]
THIS COURT ORDERS that
the Applicant's application for judicial review be granted and the matter be returned for determination anew (
de novo
) before a differently constituted panel with no question of general importance for certification.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Shore
[Traduction]: En raison d'une mauvaise appréciation des faits attribuable à la confusion suscitée par le témoignage du demandeur, laquelle a poussé la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] à commettre une erreur de fait dans sa conclusion sur la crédibilité, la Cour ne considère pas que la décision est raisonnable, une fois appréciée dans son ensemble et en contexte.
II.
Introduction
[2]
Le demandeur demande le contrôle judiciaire de la décision du 6 novembre 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas un réfugié au sens de l'article 96 de la Convention ni une personne à protéger aux termes de l'article 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 [LIPR].
III.
Contexte
[3]
Le demandeur, M. Aimé-Landry Ahishakiye, est un jeune Tutsi de Bujumbura, au Burundi.
[4]
Au début de 2010, le demandeur s'est inscrit à l'Université Espoir d'Afrique. Le demandeur dit s'être lié d'amitié avec un certain nombre d'étudiants de cet établissement qui appuyaient le parti politique des Forces nationales de libération [FNL] du Burundi.
[5]
Le demandeur explique que ces étudiants se sont mis à insister pour qu'il adhère au parti en avril 2010 et ils ont continué à exercer des pressions sur lui pendant des mois, même en dépit de ses nombreux refus.
[6]
En mai 2010, le demandeur a présenté une demande de visa canadien pour venir étudier à l'Université de Sherbrooke. Ce visa lui a été refusé, car les cours étaient déjà commencés lorsque sa demande a été examinée par l'ambassade du Canada.
[7]
Le demandeur déclare que le 24 septembre 2010, l'un des étudiants qui lui avaient demandé de se joindre aux FNL l'a interpellé et exhorté à y adhérer en lui remettant une carte de membre avec rudesse. Il déclare aussi qu'au cours de la soirée, il a reçu un coup de téléphone chargé de menaces du même étudiant et a continué à recevoir des appels du même genre jusqu'à peu avant son départ pour le Canada.
[8]
Le 27 septembre 2010, le demandeur a cessé d'aller à ses cours à l'Université Espoir d'Afrique. Il déclare qu'il n'osait plus sortir de chez lui après avoir reçu ces coups de téléphone menaçants.
[9]
Le 16 décembre 2010, le demandeur a obtenu un visa d'étudiant pour étudier à l'Université de Sherbrooke, et a quitté le Burundi pour le Canada le 29 décembre 2010.
[10]
Le 5 janvier 2011, le demandeur a présenté une demande d'asile à Etobicoke (Ontario). Il n'a pas fréquenté l'Université de Sherbrooke à son arrivée au Canada.
[11]
Le 6 novembre 2012, la SPR a statué que le demandeur n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni de personne à protéger.
IV.
Décision faisant l'objet du contrôle
[12]
Dans sa décision, la SPR a jugé que le demandeur n'était pas crédible et qu'il n'avait pas établi l'existence d'une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ni d'une menace à sa vie, ni encore d'un risque de traitements ou de peines cruels et inusités s'il retournait au Burundi.
[13]
Après avoir apprécié la crédibilité du demandeur, la SPR a conclu qu'il n'était pas plausible que les parents du demandeur prennent la situation de leur fils, alors âgé de 19 ans, « à la légère », comme l'a déclaré l'intéressé, lorsqu'il leur a appris qu'il subissait des menaces de la part d'autres étudiants.
[14]
La SPR a fait remarquer qu'on aurait raisonnablement pu s'attendre des parents du demandeur qu'ils entrent en contact avec la direction de l'établissement où les FNL exerçaient des pressions sur leur fils pour le recruter. La SPR a conclu que cette absence de réaction de la part des parents jetait un doute considérable sur la crédibilité du témoignage du demandeur.
[15]
Outre sa conclusion relativement à la crédibilité du demandeur, la SPR a souligné que la preuve objective au dossier n'établissait pas qu'il correspondait au profil des personnes généralement ciblées par les FNL, ou que le parti cherchait à recruter des membres contre leur gré. La SPR a par conséquent conclu que la preuve objective n'établissait pas l'existence d'une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ni d'une menace à sa vie, ni encore d'un risque de traitements ou de peines cruels et inusités.

VII.
Position des parties
[18]
Le demandeur a avancé plusieurs raisons à l'appui de son allégation selon laquelle la décision de la SPR n'était pas raisonnable, et toutes ont à voir avec la façon dont la SPR a apprécié la preuve au dossier.
[19]
Tout d'abord, le demandeur soutient que la SPR a mal interprété son témoignage. Selon lui, la SPR a confondu deux conversations qu'il avait eues avec ses parents au sujet des FNL: la première conversation, au cours de laquelle il leur a raconté que les membres des FNL cherchaient à le recruter, et la seconde, au cours de laquelle il leur a confié que les FNL le menaçaient.
[20]
Le demandeur fait valoir qu'étant donné que la SPR a mal interprété les éléments de preuve et tiré une conclusion défavorable quant à sa crédibilité, il est impossible de savoir avec certitude comment la SPR aurait statué dans d'autres circonstances.
[21]
Le demandeur soutient que la SPR a également mal interprété la preuve au dossier au sujet du mode de recrutement des FNL. Il déclare que la preuve montre en fait que les FNL usaient effectivement de violence pour recruter de nouveaux membres en 2010, essentiellement à l'aide de jeunes partisans.
[22]
Le demandeur soutient de plus que la SPR a commis une erreur en concluant que son témoignage sur la réaction de ses parents aux menaces des FNL n'était pas plausible. Il fait valoir qu'il a déclaré en termes clairs qu'il n'y avait pas de services de sécurité à l'université et que, en conséquence, on ne pouvait pas raisonnablement s'attendre de ses parents qu'ils communiquent avec pareils services au sujet de la sécurité de leur fils. En outre, le demandeur souligne que, dès lors que la SPR a accepté que la police du Burundi n'était pas fiable, elle n'avait aucune raison logique de s'attendre que le demandeur s'adresse à l'université pour résoudre le problème.
[23]
Enfin, le demandeur soutient que la SPR a manqué à un principe de justice naturelle en fondant sa conclusion relative à la crédibilité sur un doute dont elle n'a pas fait part au demandeur. Plus précisément, le demandeur affirme que la SPR a fait erreur en tirant une conclusion quant aux opinions politiques de son père sans d'abord lui demander directement si son père était un partisan du CNDD-FDD.
[24]
Le défendeur fait valoir que la SPR était en droit de trouver que le récit des événements du demandeur n'était pas crédible et qu'elle n'a pas fait erreur en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve relative aux atrocités commises par les FNL au Burundi à l'époque. Le défendeur soutient que, au contraire, la SPR ne disposait d'aucun élément de preuve étayant les prétentions du demandeur selon lesquelles les FNL recouraient à la menace et à la force pour recruter de nouveaux membres.
[25]
Le défendeur fait aussi valoir que la SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur dans son appréciation du témoignage du demandeur quant à la réaction de ses parents aux menaces des FNL. Il soutient qu'en alléguant que la SPR a confondu les deux conversations qu'il a mentionnées dans son témoignage, le demandeur cherche à défendre ses propres intérêts et à justifier le témoignage que la SPR a mis en doute. De plus, le défendeur affirme que la SPR était en droit de ne pas trouver crédible que le demandeur abandonne tout simplement ses études sans même demander de l'aide aux autorités.
[26]
Quant à l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle la SPR a manqué à un principe de justice fondamentale, le défendeur avance que la SPR n'a pas conclu que le père du demandeur était actif sur le plan politique ni qu'il était un partisan ou défenseur du CNDD-FDD. La SPR a simplement conclu qu'il occupait un poste approuvé par le gouvernement en place.
VIII.
Norme de contrôle
[27]
La norme de contrôle applicable aux questions portant sur l'appréciation de la preuve ou sur une conclusion en matière de crédibilité est celle de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF), au paragraphe 4).
[28]
La décision doit donc être justifiable, transparente et intelligible. Elle ne doit être infirmée que si elle est abusive et arbitraire, si elle n'est pas fondée sur la preuve ou si elle découle d'une erreur flagrante quant à l'interprétation de faits importants (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[29]
Le demandeur allègue aussi que la SPR a manqué à un principe de justice naturelle. La norme de contrôle applicable aux questions touchant à l'équité procédurale et à la justice naturelle est la norme de la décision correcte (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 46).
IX.
Analyse
[30]
De l'avis de la Cour, le demandeur a montré que la SPR a fondé sa décision sur une conclusion défavorable quant à sa crédibilité, conclusion qui découlait d'une confusion suscitée par le témoignage et, en conséquence, sur l'exposé circonstancié proprement dit.
[31]
Dans sa décision, la SPR s'est essentiellement fondée sur la réaction qu'ont eue les parents du demandeur à l'égard des menaces faites à leur fils par les FNL pour conclure que son histoire n'était pas crédible et a conclu comme suit:
[18] Le demandeur a expliqué qu'il ne s'était pas adressé à la police parce que la police n'est pas fiable. Il est évident au regard de la preuve documentaire que la population n'accorde aucune confiance aux forces de sécurité. Le tribunal considère raisonnable que le demandeur se soit abstenu de faire appel à la police.
[19] Cependant,
lorsque le tribunal a demandé au demandeur s'il avait tenu ses parents au courant des pressions exercées sur lui pour qu'il rejoigne le FNL, le demandeur a répondu que oui, mais que ses parents avaient pris ses révélations à la légère
. Le tribunal juge peu probable, voire invraisemblable, que les parents du demandeur aient pris à la légère les révélations du demandeur que le FNL cherchait à le recruter contre son gré. Le demandeur lui-même a insisté dans son exposé circonstancié qu'il avait ressenti de l'inquiétude face à la possibilité d'être mépris par les forces de sécurité pour un membre du FNL, un mouvement que le demandeur qualifie de mouvement rebelle dans son exposé circonstancié. [Non souligné dans l'original.]
[32]
Comme nous l'avons mentionné plus tôt, le demandeur prétend que c'est parce que la SPR a par inadvertance confondu deux conversations distinctes qu'il a eues avec ses parents qu'elle en est arrivée à cette conclusion. À l'inverse, dans ses observations, le défendeur soutient que ces deux conversations ne forment en fait qu'une seule et même conversation et que le demandeur cherche simplement à établir une distinction temporelle entre les faits.
[33]
La Cour ne peut souscrire à la prétention du défendeur. Comme il ressort clairement de la transcription de l'audience (Dossier certifié du tribunal, pages 293 à 294), le demandeur a relaté deux conversations distinctes qu'il a eues avec ses parents au sujet des menaces que lui faisaient les FNL. Ce n'est qu'après que la SPR eut interrogé le demandeur sur la date à laquelle il a commencé à recevoir de véritables menaces que le demandeur a parlé de la réaction de ses parents. Le demandeur a déclaré que ses parents avaient eu « très peur » et qu'ils avaient « été choqués ». La Cour se réfère à la transcription du passage en question:
PRÉSIDENTE: Vous aviez quoi? Dix-huit ans?
DEMANDEUR: J'avais, oui, à l'époque j'avais 18 ans.
PRÉSIDENTE: Vous en avez parlé à vos parents de vos problèmes?
DEMANDEUR: Oui. Donc à l'époque, donc, c'était pas des problèmes. Donc tout simplement j'ai parlé à mes parents: « Ah, vous savez quoi? Il y a des personnes qui me parlent de politique, du FNL ». Et donc mon père disait: « (Inaudible) du FNL? Pourquoi ils te parlent? » Et tout. Bon, moi je disais, bon, ils me parlent. Il me demandait donc: « Est-ce qu'ils te menacent? Est-ce que tu vois qu'il y a des signes de t'impliquer dedans? » Etc. Et donc moi je disais, bon, ils me parlent tout simplement du FNL. Donc ils discutent entre eux en parlant du CNDD, du FNL. Donc ils discutent en tous cas et donc moi j'ai pas beaucoup de trucs à dire parce que j'ai pas - j'ai pas vraiment de connaissances dans ce domaine-là et ... Donc ils ont pris ça à la légère quoi donc. Il n'y avait pas de menace, il y avait rien du tout. Donc ils étaient au courant de ça.
PRÉSIDENTE: Mais le 24 septembre, là c'était quand même assez sérieux. C'est le soir même qu'on vous avez appelé pour vous menacer.
DEMANDEUR: Oui, oui. Donc là, à partir ...
PRÉSIDENTE: Vous en avez parlé à vos parents.
DEMANDEUR: Oui, oui.
PRÉSIDENTE: Et?
DEMANDEUR: Donc quand - donc après la fin de cet appel-là donc j'ai déjà - donc tout simplement donc j'ai parlé à mes parents. Je leur ai dit que je viens de recevoir un appel et que j'avais reconnu un des étudiants qui avaient - qui étudiaient avec moi. Et donc il me disait que simplement j'allais regretter ma décision parce que j'avais pas pris la carte du parti qu'il m'avait donnée.
PRÉSIDENTE: Quelle a été leur réaction ?
DEMANDEUR: Ils ont eu très peur. Ils ont été choqués.
[34]
La Cour convient avec le demandeur que la SPR a mal interprété les explications qu'il a données au cours de son témoignage. Il est clair à la lecture de la transcription que le demandeur essayait de rapporter tout son exposé circonstancié à la SPR dans son témoignage, mais qu'il n'en a pas eu la possibilité. Dans son témoignage, le demandeur a non seulement parlé de l'incident du 24 septembre 2010, mais aussi des faits qui l'ont précédé. Ce n'est qu'après avoir été interrompu et interrogé par la SPR au sujet des menaces qui lui ont été adressées au téléphone ce 24 septembre 2010 que le demandeur a parlé de la réaction qu'avaient eue ses parents à ces menaces. Préalablement à cette intervention de la SPR, le demandeur avait décrit ce qu'il avait vécu avant qu'on ne lui profère des menaces.
[35]
Étant donné la mauvaise appréciation des faits attribuable à la confusion suscitée par le témoignage du demandeur, confusion qui a poussé la SPR à tirer une conclusion erronée sur un fait, la Cour ne considère pas que la décision est raisonnable une fois appréciée dans son ensemble et en contexte.
[36]
La SPR s'est essentiellement fondée sur cette appréciation pour justifier sa décision selon laquelle le demandeur manquait de crédibilité. Elle n'a pas accordé beaucoup d'attention aux autres éléments de preuve sur lesquels était fondée l'allégation d'une crainte justifiée, en dépit du fait que la preuve documentaire produite par le demandeur appuyait raisonnablement cette allégation de crainte de subir la persécution des jeunes membres des FNL au Burundi.
[37]
Comme la Cour en a statué dans la décision
Canada (Ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile) c El Attar
, 2013 CF 1012, « un résultat raisonnable ne saurait justifier une décision dépourvue de motifs suffisants, lorsqu'il y a obligation de donner des motifs et que ces motifs ne peuvent être étoffés compte tenu du dossier », au paragraphe 10, et  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[38]
À défaut d'une analyse approfondie des autres éléments de preuve au dossier, la Cour ne peut conclure que les principes énoncés dans l'arrêt
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appuient la décision. Même si la SPR a estimé que certains éléments de preuve n'étaient pas crédibles, elle devait poursuivre son analyse pour déterminer s'il subsistait d'autres éléments de preuve crédibles étayant une crainte fondée de persécution (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ce principe s'applique particulièrement en l'espèce où les éléments de preuve considérés comme non crédibles ne concernaient que des questions accessoires.
[39]
Ce facteur étant en soi déterminant de l'affaire, la Cour ne voit pas la nécessité de traiter des autres motifs soulevés par le demandeur.
