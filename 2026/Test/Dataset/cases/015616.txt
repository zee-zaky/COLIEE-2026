Hargrave, Prothonotary
: This application, made "ex parte" on behalf of the plaintiffs, is for an order extending the time for service of the statement of claim for 12 months.
[2]
The action arises out of damage to a consignment of plywood from Vancouver to Antwerp, Belgium, under Bills of Lading dated December 31, 1991.
[3]
The plaintiffs commenced their action on February 12, 1993. The defendants, PCL European Service Ltd., Neptune Aries Shipping Corp. and the "Florida Rainbow" have not been served. There is no affidavit evidence setting out any attempts to serve those defendants, however the defendant Pacific Commerce Line Inc. is said to have been served at their Vancouver office.
[4]
On the morning that the motion was heard the plaintiffs asked for and received an amendment to their Notice of Motion so that, as amended it referred to a reading of the pleadings and proceedings in addition to the May 18, 1994, affidavit of Marna Langner. This allowed counsel to refer to a supplemental affidavit filed May 26, 1994.
[5]
The grounds set out for extending the time for service of the Statement of Claim on the "Florida Rainbow", as set out in a supplemental affidavit filed May 26, 1994, are that the vessel has not been in port locally since June 11, 1992, some time before the issuance of the statement of claim.
[6]
I have made an order extending the time for service of the statement of claim, on the "Florida Rainbow", for 12 months from the date of this order.
[7]
This extension of the statement of claim, for "in rem" service, applied for after the initial time for the service of the statement of claim has expired, is based on the fairly exhaustive canvassing of the law by Sheppard, D.J., in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[8]
As set out in
The Captain Yiannis
, if the "Florida Rainbow" has been within the Canadian jurisdiction, unknown to the plaintiffs, the "ex parte" order may be set aside.
[9]
Extension of time for service of the corporate defendants, "in personam", stands on a different footing. An extension of time is the exception. It should not be easily granted. It requires a sufficient reason: see for example
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
[10]
Counsel noted that at some point, after the statement of claim was filed, the plaintiffs tried to settle the claim themselves. Following the return of the file by the plaintiffs, to their lawyers, service of the statement of claim on the balance of the defendants was overlooked.
[11]
Counsel referred to
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). In the
Laval Fortin
case the plaintiff's lawyer had given instructions to serve, but staff failed to send the material out for service. Mr. Justice Joyal, in extending the time for service of the statement of claim, noted that service had been intended, would have come as no surprise and was the sort of inadvertence that, based on
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), was a mere slip in practice and not a laxity.
[12]
In the present instance the affidavit material does not indicate anything in the nature of an overlooked diarization as in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mere slip in practice.
[13]
The affidavit material also seems to indicate that there were some settlement negotiations with Pacific Commerce Line Inc., the defendant which was in fact served, which did not lead to a resolution and, perhaps by extension, the negotiations were the reason that the balance of the defendants were not served.
[14]
A failure to serve a defendant because of settlement negotiations with some other party does not constitute a sufficient reason for granting an extension:
Duval Sales Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  able to find, in the material, a sufficient reason for extending the time for service on the corporate defendants. Indeed, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.):
"... when the defendant was available for service and the plaintiff was not inhibited from serving or induced by the defendant not to serve, it is almost impossible to think of a 'sufficient reason' for not serving within the time fixed for serving." (p. 404)
[16]
As I say, the time for serving the statement of claim on the vessel is extended for 12 months from today, but I will not grant an extension of time for serving the two remaining defendant companies.
Order accordingly.
