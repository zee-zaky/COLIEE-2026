[1]
Crampton, C.J.
: Mr. Kostrzewa is a 24 year old gay citizen of Poland who fears persecution for reasons related to his sexual orientation, should he be required to return to that country.
[2]
He claims that the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada committed the following reviewable errors in rejecting his claim for protection under sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]:
i. it misapprehended the evidence available to it in finding the city of Krakow to be a viable internal flight alternative [IFA] within Poland;
ii. it unreasonably concluded that he does not have a subjective fear of persecution in Poland; and
iii. it failed to consider the applicability of subsection 108(4) of the IRPA in assessing his application.
[3]
I disagree. For the reasons that follow, this application is dismissed.
I.
Background
[4]
Mr. Kostrzewa's fears of persecution and personal harm are based on the general mistreatment of gay people in Poland and on three assaults to which he was personally subjected while living in different cities in that country.
[5]
The first assault occurred in the city of Lodz in August 2007, when he was threatened and beaten by a friend after disclosing his sexual orientation to him. The second occurred in Konin in November 2007, when his jaw was broken by three men, including a bully from one of his former schools who recognized him as he was walking down the street. The third occurred in Pozan in May 2008, when he was pushed against a wall and slapped by a group of men who saw one of his friends kiss him on the cheek outside a bar.
II.
Standard of Review
[6]
It is common ground between the parties that the standard of review applicable to the findings made by the Board with respect to the availability of an IFA in Krakow and the Applicant's lack of subjective fear is reasonableness. I agree.
[7]
However, Mr. Kostrzewa takes the position that the Board's failure to address s. 108(4) of the IRPA is reviewable on a correctness standard. I disagree. This is a question of mixed fact and law. Accordingly, it is reviewable on a reasonableness standard (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 46-47;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).
III.
Analysis
A.
The Board's conclusion regarding the availability of an IFA in Krakow
[8]
In its decision, the Board identified the availability of an IFA in Krakow as being the determinative issue in this case.
[9]
Mr. Kostrzewa submitted that the Board erred in reaching its conclusion on this issue by failing to consider information set forth in one of the documents upon which it principally relied, and by reaching a conclusion that was unreasonable, given that information. I disagree.
[10]
In reaching its conclusion regarding the availability of an IFA in Krakow, the Board placed significant weight on a document entitled "Krakow for Everyone," which was included in the Board's National Documentation Package for Poland. The Board cited that document in observing that "there are numerous gay rights organizations in Poland and that Krakow has a gay-tolerant area, as well as being host to an annual gay pride parade." The Board also noted that the document refers to the existence of gay restaurants, bars and hotels in Krakow, and states that young people in Poland are more tolerant of and friendly towards gay people, especially in that city. In addition, the Board noted that the document states that "gay rights groups are growing in strength and in number every year, and the sheer number of gay-oriented Polish websites is a sign of the coming change."
[11]
However, the Board did not mention that the document also states that "slightly under 20% of homosexuals surveyed had experienced some level of violence, with a slightly larger percentage for men than women," and that "more than 85% of cases of violence go unreported" because "the police themselves will ridicule or simply ignore the individual." According to the document, the "majority of physical violence is pushing or kicking, but many have reported being punched or beaten up as well."
[12]
Mr. Kostrzewa submits that the Board erred by failing to consider this additional information in the document. He further asserts that it was unreasonable for the Board to conclude, in the face of this additional information, that he would not face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk contemplated by section 97 of the IRPA. I disagree.
[13]
In my view, the additional information that was in the document in question did not so squarely and seriously contradict the Board's conclusion as to give rise to an obligation on the part of the Board to explicitly address that information in the course of reaching its decision. Among other things, there was no indication whatsoever in the document as to whether the people who reported having experienced "some level of violence" had such experiences in the distant past, as opposed to in the last two or three years. There was also no indication of whether those individuals had experienced more than one such incident.
[14]
In the course of reaching its decision on this issue, the Board noted that the majority of documents in the evidentiary record indicated that discrimination continues against gay people in that country. The Board also noted that public figures in Poland have made anti-homosexual comments openly and that the gay pride parade in 2006 in Krakow was marred by stones and eggs being thrown at the participants.
[15]
After reviewing the evidentiary record that was before the Board, I am satisfied that the material referred to by the Board in reaching its conclusion regarding the existence of an IFA in Krakow provided a reasonable basis for, and rationally supported, that conclusion (
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 53 [
Alberta Teachers
]; and
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras 45-49 [
Halifax
]). In the absence of information in the evidentiary record which strongly suggested that its conclusion on this point was unreasonable, the Board's failure to discuss other information, including information which may have been contrary to the conclusion it reached, did not deprive its decision of its rational support, or render that decision devoid of any reasonable basis.
[16]
Mr. Kostrzewa also submitted that the Board erred by implicitly finding that the risk he would face in Krakow would be substantially different from the risk that he previously faced in Lodz. In this regard, he observed that the populations and mistreatment of gay people in the two cities is essentially the same. I disagree.
[17]
The Board was not under any obligation to compare the situations faced by gay people in the two cities and to explain why it believed that Mr. Kostrzewa would not face a serious risk of persecution or physical harm in Krakow, even though he was assaulted on one occasion in Lodz.
[18]
On the contrary, Mr. Kostrzewa bore the burden of establishing, with clear and convincing evidence, why he would face a serious risk of persecution or a likelihood of a risk contemplated by section 97, should he be required to return to Poland and live in Krakow (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Ultimately, he failed to do so.
[19]
In oral argument, Mr. Kostrzewa's counsel attempted to impugn the value of the document entitled "Krakow for Everyone" by stating that it had been written for visitors to that city, and did not reflect situation faced by its gay residents. However, this fails to recognize that the material in the document that was referenced by the Board provided a reasonable basis for, and rationally supported, the Board's conclusion regarding the situation that he would face as a resident of Krakow. Moreover, as stated above, it was Mr. Kostrzewa's burden to demonstrate that he would face a serious possibility of persecution, or a likely risk contemplated by section 97, if he were to return to Krakow. It was not the Board's burden to establish the contrary. In his written and oral submissions, Mr. Kostrzewa did not identify anything in the evidentiary record, other than other passages in the above-mentioned document, and his own experiences (which were considered by the Board) that supported his case.
[20]
On the evidentiary record that was before the Board, I am satisfied that it was entirely reasonable for the Board to conclude, based on findings discussed above, that he had not met that burden. That conclusion was well "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" and was appropriately justified, transparent and intelligible ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47).
[21]
I would simply add that there was other evidence in the record, including in the document entitled "Krakow for Everyone," which provided further support for the Board's conclusion regarding the availability of an IFA in Krakow (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
Given the foregoing, the other errors that Mr. Kostrzewa identified in the Board's decision, concerning the location and dates of the three assaults to which he was subjected in Poland, were not material. At paragraphs 5 and 6 of its decision, the Board identified the correct dates of those assaults. It then did so a second time at paragraph 11. While it did not specifically mention that the first assault occurred in Lodz, this was not material to its finding regarding the availability of an IFA in Krakow. In oral argument, counsel to Mr. Kostrzewa conceded that the other factual errors identified in Exhibit D to his affidavit, and not discussed in these reasons for judgment, were not material.
[23]
The conclusion reached above regarding the reasonableness of the Board's IFA finding is a sufficient basis upon which to dismiss this application. However, for completeness, I will address below the two other main issues that Mr. Kostrzewa has raised.
B.
The Board's findings with respect to subjective fear
[24]
Mr. Kostrzewa submitted that the concerns identified by the Board with respect to his allegations of subjective fear were unreasonable. I disagree.
[25]
The Board identified three concerns in this regard, the most important of which concerned Mr. Kostrzewa's reavailments to Poland. There were two such reavailments. The first was in January 2008, after his initial visit to Canada in December 2007. That reavailment was prompted by pressure from his family to finish his school year. The second reavailment was in December 2008, when he returned to Poland for three weeks, again at the request of his family. On this occasion, his family, who still did not know that he is gay, promised that he wouldn't be left alone at any time and that he could stay at home and perhaps join them on a trip to Slovakia. Although the Board did not specifically note that there were two reavailments, it observed that it had "difficulty accepting that any reasonable person would place themselves in such a risk of harm or danger as alleged by you for family reunification or fear of losing family support."
[26]
In my view, this observation by the Board was entirely reasonable. As has been repeatedly held by this Court, a refugee claimant's reavailment to the jurisdiction in which he or she fears persecution or a type of harm contemplated by section 97 of the IRPA seriously undermines allegations of subjective fear, particularly in the absence of a compelling reason for such reavailment (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[27]
The Board also expressed concern about Mr. Kostrzewa's delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada. In this regard, the Board noted that although he came to Canada in July 2008 and again in January 2009 (after his three-week return to Poland), he did not apply for refugee protection until September 2010. Although Mr. Kostrzewa testified that he had a valid student visa during that period and was unaware of the possibility of applying for refugee protection until shortly before he submitted his application, it was not unreasonable for the Board to draw a negative inference regarding his subjective fear, based on his failure to apply for protection within a reasonable period of time after his arrival in Canada (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)).
[28]
Given the foregoing, the error made by the Board with respect to Mr. Kostrzewa's delay in leaving Poland after the third assault was not material. The same is true with respect to its erroneous suggestion that Mr. Kostrzewa may not have applied for refugee protection until his student visa expired.
C.
The Board's failure to conduct an assessment under subsection 108(4)
[29]
Mr. Kostrzewa submitted that in cases where a reasonable finding of an IFA would otherwise be determinative, the existence of subjective fear on the part of an applicant for refugee protection triggers an obligation on the Board to consider subsection 108(4) of the IRPA. I disagree.
[30]
There is no obligation on the Board to consider subsection 108(4) unless (i) it has specifically found that the applicant has suffered past persecution; or (ii) there is
prima facie
evidence of past persecution that is so exceptional in its severity that it rises to the level of being "appalling" or "atrocious" (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 32).
[31]
In the case at bar, the Board did not make a finding of past persecution. It proceeded directly to a forward looking assessment of whether Mr. Kostrzewa has a well-founded fear of future persecution, as it was entitled to do ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 31). In addition, in my view, the three assaults that Mr. Kostrzewa alleges he suffered did not constitute
prima facie
evidence of past persecution that is so exceptional in its severity that it rises to the level of being "appalling" or "atrocious," relative to the typical types of persecution that have been alleged and recognized by the Board or in the jurisprudence.
[32]
Accordingly, it was not unreasonable for the Board to have failed to have addressed the potential applicability of subsection 108(4) to Mr. Kostrzewa in its decision.
IV.
Conclusion
[33]
For the reasons set forth above, the adverse findings reached by the Board with respect to the availability of an IFA in Krakow and Mr. Kostrzewa's lack of subjective fear were not unreasonable. Similarly, it was not unreasonable for the Board to have failed to explicitly conduct an assessment under subsection 108(4) of the IRPA.
[34]
Accordingly, this application is dismissed.
JUDGMENT
[35]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUGES that
:
1. This application is dismissed.
2. There is no question for certification.

 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Crampton
[Traduction]: M. Kostrzewa est un citoyen de la Pologne, âgé de 24 ans, qui craint la persécution pour des motifs liés à son orientation sexuelle, en cas de retour dans son pays.
[2]
Il prétend que la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada a commis les erreurs susceptibles de contrôle suivantes, lorsqu'elle a rejeté sa demande d'asile présentée en application des articles 96 et 97 de la
Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés
, LC 2001, c 27 (la LIPR):
i. elle a mal compris la preuve dont elle disposait lorsqu'elle a conclu que la ville de Cracovie offrait une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) viable en Pologne;
ii. elle a conclu de façon déraisonnable qu'il n'avait pas de crainte subjective de persécution en Pologne;
iii. elle a omis d'examiner l'application du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR lorsqu'elle a examiné sa demande.
[3]
La cour n'est pas d'accord. Pour les motifs exposés ci-après, la présente demande sera rejetée.
I.
Les faits
[4]
Les craintes de persécution et de préjudice personnel de M. Kostrzewa sont basées sur les mauvais traitements généralement infligés aux personnes homosexuelles en Pologne, et sur trois voies de fait dont il a été personnellement l'objet lorsqu'il vivait dans différentes villes de ce pays.
[5]
La première voie de fait a eu lieu dans la ville de Lodz en août 2007, lorsque le demandeur a été menacé et battu par un ami après lui avoir révélé son orientation sexuelle. La deuxième a eu lieu à Konin en novembre 2007, lorsque sa mâchoire a été brisée par trois hommes, dont un intimidateur, de l'une de ses anciennes écoles qui l'ont reconnu alors qu'il marchait dans la rue. La troisième voie de fait a eu lieu à Pozan en mai 2008, lorsqu'il a été poussé contre un mur et giflé par un groupe d'hommes qui ont vu l'un de ses amis l'embrasser sur la joue à l'extérieur d'un bar.
II.
La norme de contrôle
[6]
Les parties s'accordent pour dire que la norme de contrôle applicable aux conclusions tirées par la Commission quant à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie et quant au défaut de crainte subjective du demandeur est la décision raisonnable. La Cour est d'accord.
[7]
Toutefois, M. Kostrzewa est d'avis que l'omission de la Commission d'examiner le paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR est susceptible de contrôle selon la décision correcte. La Cour n'est pas d'accord. Il s'agit d'une question mixte de faits et de droit. Par conséquent, elle est susceptible de contrôle selon la norme de la décision raisonnable (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );
Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 46 et 47;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 25 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )).
III.
L'analyse
A.
La conclusion de la Commission quant à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie
[8]
Dans sa décision, la Commission a déclaré que l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie était la question décisive en l'espèce.
[9]
M. Kostrzewa a fait observer que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a tiré sa conclusion relativement à cette question parce qu'elle n'a pas tenu compte des renseignements contenus dans l'un des documents sur lesquels elle s'est principalement fondée, et parce qu'elle a tiré une conclusion qui était déraisonnable, au vu de ces renseignements. La Cour n'est pas d'accord.
[10]
Lorsqu'elle a tiré sa conclusion quant à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie, la Commission a accordé beaucoup de poids à un document intitulé [traduction] « Cracovie pour tous », qui faisait partie du Cartable national de documentation de la Commission pour la Pologne. La Commission a fait référence à ce document qui « fait état de l'existence de nombreuses organisations de défense des droits des homosexuels en Pologne, ainsi que d'un quartier gai à Cracovie, ville où se déroule chaque année un défilé de la fierté gaie ». La Commission a aussi souligné que le document faisait référence à l'existence de restaurants, bars et hôtels pour homosexuels à Cracovie, et dans le document on peut lire que les jeunes en Pologne sont plus tolérants et amicaux à l'égard des homosexuels, en particulier dans la ville de Cracovie. De plus, la Commission a souligné que le document déclare qu'il convient de noter que « des groupes similaires s'ajoutent chaque année et qu'ils jouissent d'un appui croissant; le nombre considérable de sites Web polonais axés sur les homosexuels est un signe du changement qui se dessine ».
[11]
Toutefois, la Commission n'a pas mentionné que le document déclarait aussi que [traduction] « un peu moins de 20 % des homosexuels interrogés ont vécu une forme quelconque de violence, le pourcentage est légèrement plus élevé pour les hommes que pour les femmes », et que [traduction] « plus de 85 % des cas de violence ne sont pas signalés », parce que [traduction] « les policiers eux-mêmes tournent en ridicule ou méprisent simplement la personne ». Selon le document, [traduction] « la majorité des violences physiques consistent à pousser ou cogner, mais beaucoup de personnes ont signalé qu'elles avaient reçu des coups ou qu'elles avaient aussi été frappées ».
[12]
M. Kostrzewa soutient que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a omis de prendre en compte ce renseignement supplémentaire contenu dans le document. Il affirme en outre qu'il était déraisonnable que la Commission conclue, au vu de ce renseignement supplémentaire, qu'il ne serait pas soumis à une possibilité sérieuse d'être persécuté ou à un risque tel qu'il est énoncé à l'article 97 de la LIPR. La Cour n'est pas d'accord.
[13]
Selon la Cour, le renseignement supplémentaire contenu dans le document en question ne contredisait pas si sérieusement et si carrément la conclusion de la Commission de telle sorte que cela donnait naissance à une obligation pour la Commission de se pencher explicitement sur ce renseignement lorsqu'elle rendait sa décision. Parmi d'autres éléments, il n'y avait absolument aucune indication dans le document quant à savoir si les personnes qui ont signalé avoir vécu [traduction] « une violence quelconque » ont vécu de telles expériences dans un passé lointain, et non pas au cours des deux ou trois dernières années. Rien n'indiquait non plus si ces personnes avaient vécu ces expériences plus d'une fois.
[14]
Lorsqu'elle a rendu sa décision sur ladite question, la Commission a souligné que la majorité des documents contenus dans le dossier de la preuve indiquaient que la discrimination continuait d'exister contre les personnes homosexuelles dans ce pays. La Commission a aussi souligné que des personnes connues en Pologne avaient prononcé en public des déclarations homophobes, et que des pierres et des œufs avaient été lancés à des participants au cours du défilé de la fierté gaie qui a eu lieu à Cracovie en 2006.
[15]
Après avoir examiné le dossier de la preuve dont la Commission disposait, la Cour est convaincue que les documents auxquels la Commission s'est référée lorsqu'elle a tiré sa conclusion relative à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie donnaient une base raisonnable à cette conclusion, et cette conclusion était étayée de façon rationnelle (
Alberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 53 (
Alberta Teachers
); et
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 45 à 49 (
Halifax
)). En l'absence de renseignements contenus dans le dossier de la preuve qui donnent fortement à penser que la conclusion relative à cet aspect était déraisonnable, l'omission de la Commission de discuter d'autres renseignements, notamment des renseignements qui auraient pu être contraires à la conclusion tirée par la Commission, ne prive pas sa décision de son soutien rationnel ou ne rendent pas ladite décision dépourvue de toute base raisonnable.
[16]
M. Kostrzewa prétend aussi que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu'elle a conclu de façon implicite que le risque auquel il serait exposé à Cracovie serait grandement différent du risque auquel il a été auparavant exposé à Lodz. À cet égard, il a souligné que les personnes, et les mauvais traitements envers les homosexuels dans les deux villes sont essentiellement les mêmes. La Cour n'est pas d'accord.
[17]
La Courn'avait aucune obligation de comparer les situations auxquelles les personnes homosexuelles sont exposées dans les deux villes ni d'expliquer la raison pour laquelle elle a conclu que M. Kostrzewa ne serait pas soumis à un risque sérieux de persécution ou de préjudice physique à Cracovie, même s'il avait été l'objet, une fois, de voie de fait à Lodz.
[18]
Au contraire, il incombait à M. Kostrzewa d'établir, à l'aide d'une preuve claire et convaincante, la raison pour laquelle il serait exposé à un risque sérieux de persécution ou à une possibilité de risque telle qu'elle est énoncée à l'article 97 s'il était obligé de retourner en Pologne et de vivre à Cracovie (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En définitive, il a omis de le faire.
[19]
Dans ses observations orales, l'avocat de M. Kostrzewa a tenté de contester l'importance du document intitulé [traduction] « Cracovie pour tous », lorsqu'il a déclaré que ce document avait été rédigé pour les visiteurs de la ville et qu'il n'était pas le reflet de la situation à laquelle les résidents homosexuels de la ville sont exposés. Toutefois, une telle observation ne tient pas compte du fait que les éléments contenus dans le document, et auxquels la Commission faisait référence donnaient une base raisonnable et étayée rationnellement à la conclusion de la Commission relative à la situation à laquelle il serait exposé en tant que résident de Cracovie. De plus, comme cela est indiqué ci-dessus, il incombait à M. Kostrzewa d'établir qu'il serait exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution ou à un risque tel qu'énoncé à l'article 97, en cas de retour à Cracovie. Il n'appartenait pas à la Commission d'établir le contraire. Dans ses observations écrites et orales, M. Kostrzewa n'a rien décrit dans le dossier de la preuve qui étayait sa cause, à l'exception des extraits du document mentionné ci-dessus et de ses propres expériences (dont la Commission a tenu compte).
[20]
Vu le dossier de la preuve dont la Commission disposait, la Cour est convaincue qu'il était totalement raisonnable que la Commission décide, sur la base des conclusions que la Cour a exposées ci-dessus, que le demandeur ne s'était pas déchargé de son fardeau. Cette conclusion appartenait bien « aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit », et elle était suffisamment justifiée, transparente et intelligible ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47).
[21]
La Couraimerait simplement ajouter qu'il existait d'autres éléments de preuve contenus dans le dossier, notamment le document intitulé [traduction] « Cracovie pour tous », qui apportaient un appui supplémentaire à la conclusion de la Commission relative à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie (
Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[22]
Étant donné ce qui précède, les autres erreurs que M. Kostrzewa a relevées dans la décision de la Commission, en ce qui a trait aux lieux et aux dates des trois voies de fait dont il a été l'objet en Pologne, n'étaient pas importantes. Aux paragraphes 5 et 6 de sa décision, la Commission a écrit les dates exactes de ces voies de fait. Ensuite, elle l'a fait une deuxième fois au paragraphe 11. Bien qu'elle n'ait pas spécialement mentionné que la première voie de fait a eu lieu à Lodz, cela n'était pas important quant à la conclusion relative à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie. Dans ses observations orales, l'avocat de M. Kostrzewa a admis que les autres erreurs de fait décrites à la pièce D de son affidavit et dont la Cour ne débat pas dans les présents motifs du jugement n'étaient pas importantes.
[23]
La conclusion relative au caractère raisonnable de la décision de la Commission en ce qui a trait à l'existence de la PRI tirée ci-dessus est un fondement suffisant pour le rejet de la présente demande. Toutefois, par souci d'exhaustivité, j'examinerai ci-après les deux autres questions principales en litige que M. Kostrzewa a soulevées.
B.
Les conclusions de la Commission relativement à la crainte subjective
[24]
M. Kostrzewa a fait observer que les préoccupations décrites par la Commission relativement à sa crainte subjective prétendue étaient déraisonnables. La Cour n'est pas d'accord.
[25]
La Commission a décrit trois préoccupations à cet égard, la plus importante était le ré-établissement de M. Kostrzewa en Pologne. Il y avait eu deux tels ré-établissements. Le premier était en janvier 2008, après sa première visite au Canada en décembre 2007. Ce ré-établissement avait été accéléré en raison des pressions exercées par sa famille pour qu'il termine son année scolaire. Le second ré-établissement a eu lieu en décembre 2008, lorsqu'il est retourné en Pologne pendant trois semaines, une fois de plus à la demande de sa famille. À cette occasion, sa famille, qui ne savait toujours pas qu'il était homosexuel, avait promis qu'il ne serait jamais laissé seul à quelque moment que ce soit, et qu'il pouvait demeurer à leur résidence, et peut-être les rejoindre lors d'un voyage en Slovaquie. Bien que la Commission n'ait pas spécialement fait référence aux deux ré-établissements, elle a fait observer qu'elle avait « de la difficulté à accepter qu'une personne raisonnable se place d'elle-même dans une situation comme celle que vous avez décrite - où elle risque de subir un préjudice ou d'être exposée à une menace - pour la réunification de sa famille ou par crainte de perdre le soutien de celle-ci ».
[26]
Selon la Cour, une telle observation de la Commission était totalement raisonnable. Comme la Cour l'a décidé à de nombreuses reprises, le fait pour un demandeur d'asile de se ré-établir dans le pays dans lequel il déclare craindre la persécution ou un préjudice tel qu'il est énoncé à l'article 97 de la LIPR mine grandement les prétentions de crainte subjective, en particulier en l'absence de raisons impérieuses pour un tel ré-établissement (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 21;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 35;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).
[27]
La Commission a aussi exprimé des préoccupations quant au fait que M. Kostrzewa avait tardé à présenter sa demande d'asile au Canada. À cet égard, la Commission a souligné que bien qu'il soit venu au Canada en juillet 2008, et encore en janvier 2009 (après son retour de trois mois en Pologne), il n'a demandé l'asile qu'en septembre 2010. Bien que dans son témoignage M. Kostrzewa ait déclaré qu'il avait eu un visa d'étudiant valable pendant cette période, et qu'il n'a été au courant de la possibilité de présenter une demande d'asile que peu de temps avant de présenter sa demande, il n'était pas déraisonnable que la Commission ait tiré une inférence défavorable relativement à sa crainte subjective, sur la base de son omission de présenter une demande d'asile pendant une période raisonnable de temps, après son arrivée au Canada (
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 15;
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CA)).
[28]
Vu ce qui précède, l'erreur faite par la Commission relativement au retard mis par M. Kostrzewa à quitter la Pologne après la troisième voie de fait n'était pas importante. Il en va de même lorsque la Commission donne erronément à penser que M. Kostrzewa pouvait ne pas avoir présenté de demande d'asile jusqu'à ce que son visa d'étudiant ait expiré.
C.
L'omission de la Commission de mener une évaluation en application du paragraphe 108(4)
[29]
M. Kostrzewa a fait valoir que dans les causes où il existe une conclusion raisonnable d'existence d'une PRI qui serait autrement décisive, l'existence d'une crainte subjective de la part d'un demandeur d'asile entraîne une obligation pour la Commission de prendre en compte le paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR. La Cour n'est pas d'accord.
[30]
La Commission n'a pas l'obligation de prendre en compte l'applicabilité du paragraphe 108(4) à moins qu': (i) elle n'ait conclu précisément que le demandeur a subi une persécution dans le passé; ou (ii) il existe une preuve prima facie de persécution passée d'une gravité si exceptionnelle qu'elle atteint un degré tel qu'on la qualifie d'« épouvantable » ou « atroce »(
 <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 53; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 32).
[31]
En l'espèce, la Commission n'a pas tiré de conclusion d'existence d'une persécution antérieure. Elle s'est directement penchée sur une évaluation pour l'avenir de la question de savoir si M. Kostrzewa craignait avec raison une persécution à l'avenir, comme elle était en droit de le faire ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 31). De plus, selon la Cour, les trois voies de fait que M. Kostrzewa dit avoir subies ne constituent pas une preuve prima faciede persécution passée qui est si exceptionnelle dans sa gravité qu'elle atteint un degré tel qu'on la qualifie d'« épouvantable » ou d'« atroce »quant aux types de persécution qui ont été prétendues et admises par la Commission ou par la jurisprudence.
[32]
Par conséquent, il n'était pas déraisonnable que la Commission ait omis d'examiner, dans sa décision, l'applicabilité possible du paragraphe 108(4) à M. Kostrzewa.
IV.
Conclusion

Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessus, les conclusions défavorables que la Commission a tirées relativement à l'existence d'une PRI à Cracovie et relativement à l'absence de crainte subjective de M. Kostrzewa n'étaient pas déraisonnables. De façon semblable, il n'était pas déraisonnable que la Commission omette de mener une évaluation spéciale pour l'application du paragraphe 108(4) de la LIPR.
[34]
Par conséquent, la présente demande sera rejetée.
