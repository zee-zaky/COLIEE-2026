Dubé, J.
: These two appeals, heard together, are from the decision of a Citizenship Judge denying the applications for Canadian citizenship of Sik Hong Lau and his wife Lai-Sze Hong Lau.
[2]
It is well-established that a citizenship appeal is effectively a trial de novo, although the record of the trial below may be considered (Re Calderwood, [1989] 1 F.C. 198; 21 F.T.R. 105, at 199 F.C.). In this instance the reasons for decision of Judge Kan are very thorough and useful. These two appellants and their immigration consultant testified at the appeal and shed additional light in the matter.
[3]
The applicants are a Hong Kong couple who were lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence, with their two young children, on July 24, 1983. They initially remained in Canada for only three days. However, they returned on May 26, 1984, when Mr. Lau remained for two weeks and returned to Hong Kong and continued travelling around the world to activate his booming electronics business. He returned to Canada whenever possible. The record shows that in the four years before his application for citizenship he made 13 trips to Canada, staying usually for a period of about three weeks.
[4]
On the other hand, his wife remained in their Richmond, B.C. residence from May, 1984 onward. Her children began to attend grade school and kindergarten locally. In December 1984, during one of her husband's return visits, they bought a house in Richmond. However, in May, 1986, Mrs. Lau heard from her sister that her husband was living with another woman in Hong Kong and decided to move back to Hong Kong with her two children so as to salvage her marriage. Those very personal reasons for her return to Hong Kong were not clearly identified at the citizenship hearing.
[5]
Thus, in May 1987, the Laus sold their house in Richmond (at a loss). They, however, obtained permission from a close friend to use his house there as their own whenever they returned to Canada, until they bought a new house. Since that time they made periodic return trips to this country.
[6]
They applied for citizenship on August 26, 1987. The Judge found that Mr. Lau himself had never established residence in Canada and that while his wife had done so, she had not maintained that residence for the required number of years and had, in fact, abandoned the residence. The Judge found that all the other requirements of citizenship had been met except for the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c) (formerly 5(1)(b)) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, which reads as follows:
"5(1) The minister shall grant citizenship to any person who:
(c) has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence,
has not ceased since such admission to be a permanent resident pursuant to s. 24 of the Immigration Act
, and has within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:
(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half day of residence, and
(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence."
[7]
The words in bold typeface were added by amendment in April, 1978. The purpose of the amendment was explained by Grant, J., in Re Roberts, 92 D.L.R.(3d) 76, at 77, as follows:
"It would appear that the purpose of Parliament in making such amendment was to relieve persons seeking citizenship from the strict rule requiring complete physical presence of the applicant in Canada during the accumulation of the three years residence required by the subsection."
[8]
Under the earlier jurisprudence it was considered that three years of physical presence was an essential requirement for the obtention of citizenship. On June 13, 1978, the then Associate Chief Justice Thurlow of the Trial Division of this Court in Re Papadogiorgakis, 88 D.L.R.(3d) 243, liberalized the interpretation of the Act. He held that a student who had established a place of residence in Nova Scotia and returned there frequently while pursuing a course of studies in the United States with the intention of eventually establishing a business in Canada, was allowed to count his period of studies towards his residence requirement. He said as follows at page 248:
"A person with an established home of his own in which he lives does not cease to be resident there when he leaves it for a temporary purpose whether on business or vacation or even to pursue a course of study. The fact of his family remaining there while he is away may lend support for the conclusion that he has not ceased to reside there. The conclusion may be reached, as well, even though the absence may be more or less lengthy. It is also enhanced if he returns there frequently when the opportunity to do so arises. It is, as Rand, J., appears to me to be saying in the passage I have read [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 225] chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question."
[9]
There followed a long line of cases where Federal Court judges exercised a liberal discretion in their determination of appellants' compliance with residency requirements. For example, in a recent decision, Re Calderwood (quoted earlier), Joyal, J., analyzed as follows the results of the Papadogiorgakis decision:
"An analysis of the Papadogiorgakis decision discloses the numerous avenues of enquires which may be followed in order to establish if residency rules under the Citizenship Act have or have not been met. Various indicia have accordingly been met in individual cases. Such indicia as family connections in Canada, a continuing place of residence, bank accounts in Canadian banks, provincial driving licences, membership in OHIP or in community and professional organizations, frequency of return trips to Canada, have been applied. The list may be said to be inexhaustible and the weight to be given to any of its several manifestations may of course vary from case to case."
[10]
In an earlier decision,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , I held that a Lebanese couple who had established a home at Hawkesbury, Ontario, were entitled to citizenship even though the husband was still employed at the Beirut Airport until he could find work in Canada and had been unable to spend much time in this country during the four year period residency. Generally, the Court, therefore, favours a liberal interpretation of the residency requirement. For instance, a frequently quoted passage from Walsh, J., in Re Kleifges, 84 D.L.R.(3d) 183, at 189, bears reproduction:
"For an applicant who would very obviously make an excellent citizen the provisions of the Act should be given a liberal interpretation so as to make the granting of citizenship to him possible, rather than a narrow and restricted interpretation."
[11]
Clearly, what the court must find is whether or not there was an intention on the part of the applicant to adopt Canada as his permanent residence. Such intention cannot be established merely through a pious, self-serving declaration on the part of the applicant. It must rest on a number of indicia of residency.
[12]
In my view, the indicia in this case point strongly towards a firm intention on the part of both applicants to acquire citizenship and to live in Canada. As mentioned earlier, there is, of course, the physical presence in Canada for two years of Mrs. Lau and her two children. What I said in the Abi-Zeid case mentioned earlier applies to this case as well (at pages 596 and 597):
"The continued presence of his wife and children there constituted a lively and living testimony of his intentions ... Although the initial period spent in Canada was much shorter in the respondent's case than in that of the student Papadogiorgakis, it remains a fact that the respondent's roots in Canada are much deeper: he had his own family waiting for him here."
[13]
Mr. Lau is a dynamic and successful entrepreneur. He is the head of a world-wide electronics firm operating on three continents. The 1989 annual report of Starlight Industrial Holdings Limited, of which Mr. Lau is the chairman, shows that the group's turnover for that year was of HK $425 million, 34% higher than the previous year. His family, of which he is the oldest son at the age of 42, owns 65% of the shares of the company.
[14]
Unfortunately, his operations to date have not been as successful in Canada. In November 1981, he met a professional advisor on immigration matters by the name of Allan Eaton. In January 1982, on the advice of Mr. Eaton, he bought for $220,000.00 an apartment building in Winnipeg. Then, Mr. Eaton took him to the Provincial Economic Development Authority in Manitoba where a proposal prepared by Mr. Eaton was presented to the authority. The proposal included the building of a factory to manufacture and repair electronic wares for sales and services on the North American market. In March 1983, again on the advice of Mr. Eaton, Mr. Lau bought a second building for that factory in Winnipeg.
[15]
Both men formed a company incorporated in British Columbia, Starlight Manufacturing Company of Canada Ltd., to operate Mr. Lau's interest in this country. Mr. Eaton became a twenty-five percent partner. Mr. Eaton was not called as a witness at the hearing, but it is the evidence of Mr. Lau that, because of Mr. Eaton's negligence and incompetence, the Canadian venture never got off the ground. Mr. Lau still owns the empty factory in Winnipeg. The Starlight Manufacturing Company of Canada Limited is still in existence and both former partners have been unable to agree on a price for the sale of Mr. Eaton's shares to Mr. Lau.
[16]
Mr. Lau claims, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that Mr. Eaton took Mr. Lau in October 1982, to the Canadian Consulate in New York City to obtain his immigrant status as "entrepreneur", although a subsequent document of immigration describes him as a "worker immigrant". Mr. Eaton would also have advised Mr. Lau that, as an entrepreneur, he did not have to reside in Canada and to operate his company from this country to obtain Canadian citizenship. Mr. Eaton charged Mr. Lau a total fee of $8,000.00 for his services as a consultant.
[17]
Obviously, ignorance of the law and bad advice are not excuse and do not, by themselves, dispense a person from the requirements for citizenship. They may, however, be considered as an indicia of the true intentions of that person. And, in my view, all the circumstances tend to show an honest intention on the part of the appellants to reside in Canada and to become Canadian citizens.
[18]
The citizenship judge found in her reasons for judgment that during the relevant period Mrs. Lau spent 628 days and Mr. Lau 179 days in Canada. As mentioned earlier, they purchased a home here, sent their children to the local schools in Richmond, B.C. and, as testified by Mrs. Lau, they would have been delighted to reside there, but she felt obliged to return quickly to Hong Kong to salvage her marriage. Mr. Lau is still paying income tax in Canada and still owns a building in Winnipeg. He opened bank accounts in British Columbia from 1983 at the following banks. He did not withdraw the money and the bank balances are presently as follows:
Bank of Montreal -
$30,000.00
Royal Bank -
$120,000.00
Hong Kong Bank of Canada -
$160,000.00
He also purchased two term deposit certificates with Merrill Lynch which will be worth some $500,000.00 each in the years 1997 and 2000. These monies were invested by Mr. Lau as additional security for his retirement in Canada.
[19]
I should also add that two of Mr. Lau's younger brothers are Canadian landed immigrants and a third one is a Canadian citizen living in Toronto for the past twelve years.
[20]
Consequently, I am of the view that both appellants were throughout the material period, either physically present or temporarily absent with the firm intention to return to Canada and to live permanently here. I also feel, although this is not the basis for my decision, that Mr. Lau can make an outstanding contribution to the economic entrepreneurship of this country.
[21]
Consequently the appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
