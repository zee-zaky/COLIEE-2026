    "[1]\nBlais, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review seeking to determine the legality of a decision by the Appeal Division (hereinafter \"the Appeal Division\") of the National Parole Board (hereinafter \"the NPB\") on June 12, 2000 by members M. Charbonneau and A. Bachand in which the Appeal Division approved the initial decision.\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATION",
    "[2]\nThe defendant asked that pursuant to s. 303(2) of the\nFederal Court Rules\n(1998), the Attorney General of Canada be named as defendant in this case, not the NPB: the request was approved and the Attorney General of Canada will henceforth be named as defendant.\nFACTS",
    "[3]\nThe plaintiff Richard Hudon was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment for conspiracy to import narcotics on November 17, 1994.",
    "[4]\nThe plaintiff is a member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang.",
    "[5]\nThe plaintiff has been eligible for day parole since January 16, 1997 and full parole since March 18, 1999.",
    "[6]\nConsequently, on July 20, 1999 the plaintiff had a hearing before the members P. Cadieux and G. Roussel.",
    "[7]\nDuring that hearing the plaintiff submitted a new release plan, namely taking a \"bricklaying\" training program. Accordingly, the NPB asked Correctional Service Canada (hereinafter \"CSC\") to provide new information.",
    "[8]\nOn July 21 and 23, 1999 a memorandum was sent by CSC and representations made by counsel for the plaintiff indicating that the information requested by the NPB was not available.",
    "[9]\nOn July 28, 1999 in\nNPB Pre-Release Decision Sheet\n, the NPB decided that the decision should be postponed until additional information was received regarding implementation of the plaintiff's new release plan.",
    "[10]\nThis additional information was forwarded by the plaintiff's case management officer, N. Desrosiers, on August 4, 1999.",
    "[11]\nOn September 15, 1999 the NPB informed the plaintiff that a new hearing of his case had been scheduled for September 30, 1999.",
    "[12]\nOn September 20, 1999 the plaintiff received a letter from members Cadieux and Roussel indicating that the additional information provided on August 4, 1999 was insufficient since there was no specific reply regarding acceptance of the plaintiff's candidacy for the \"bricklaying\" program.",
    "[13]\nThe members then asked CSC to send them further written clarifications, and in the meantime decided to delete the plaintiff's case from the hearing roll for September 30, 1999.",
    "[14]\nOn October 4, 1999 the NPB received a new report from CSC indicating that it was impossible for the plaintiff to proceed with his training as a \"bricklayer\" as part of specialized training.",
    "[15]\nOn October 5, 1999 the NPB informed the plaintiff that he would have another hearing before members Cadieux and Roussel.",
    "[16]\nOn December 8, 1999 another general assessment was sent to the NPB by CSC and the plaintiff again changed his release plan, this time to New Brunswick.",
    "[17]\nOn January 26, 2000, as promised, the plaintiff was again heard by members Cadieux and Roussel. The NPB's final decision was to deny the plaintiff any form of parole.",
    "[18]\nThe plaintiff appealed this decision to the Appeal Division before members M. Charbonneau and A. Bachand, alleging a reasonable apprehension of bias and infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information prior to the holding of the second hearing.",
    "[19]\nOn June 12, 2000 the Appeal Division affirmed the first level decision and dismissed the plaintiff's appeal.",
    "[20]\nConsequently, on July 14, 2000 the plaintiff filed an application for judicial review.\nPOINTS AT ISSUE",
    "[21]\n1. Should the plaintiff first have made the allegations of infringements of the rules of natural justice (institutional independence, bias and disclosure) to the first level? If so, should the instant application for judicial review fail without it being necessary to go any further?\n2. Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias as a result of administrative interference?\n3. Was there an infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information before the second hearing was held?\nDECISION SOUGHT",
    "[22]\nThe plaintiff is asking this Court to allow the instant application for judicial review and quash the decision by the Appeal Division on June 12, 2000.\nANALYSIS\n1. Should the plaintiff have first made the allegations of infringements of the rules of natural justice to the first level?",
    "[23]\nYes, the plaintiff should have raised the arguments of institutional independence, bias and disclosure at the first level.",
    "[24]\nThe defendant submitted that it is well-settled law that questions of infringement of the rules of natural justice (institutional independence, bias and disclosure) should be raised before the tribunal in question. In his submission, the tribunal hearing the case is in the best position to intervene from the outset. In the case at bar, for example, on the allegation of bias, the plaintiff could have asked the NPB to decline to rule or, on the allegation of a lack of disclosure, asked for further time in which information could be disclosed to him. Specifically, by raising the question at the first practicable opportunity the plaintiff would have shown that he really believed that his case was in danger.",
    "[25]\nThe questions of institutional independence, bias and disclosure were not raised before the first level members for the first time but on appeal, and now on judicial review. In the defendant's opinion the plaintiff, by not raising these arguments at the first practicable opportunity, gave up his right to make them. That is exactly what the Appeal Division concluded at p. 4 of its decision:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"Additionally, on listening to the resumed hearing of January 26, 2000 we noted that your counsel did not see fit to submit any argument to the members regarding the alleged infringement of the rules of natural justice, in the sense that he made this submission to the Appeal Division.\"",
    "[26]\nThe defendant referred to\nEnergy and Chemical Workers' Union and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Re\n, [1986] 1 F.C. 103; 64 N.R. 126 (F.C.A.), in which MacGuigan, J.A., said at 113  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\"However, even apart from this express waiver, AECL's whole course of conduct before the Tribunal constituted an implied waiver of any assertion of a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal.\nThe only reasonable course of conduct for a party reasonably apprehensive of bias would be to allege a violation of natural justice at the earliest practicable opportunity\n. Here, AECL called witnesses, cross-examined the witnesses called by the Commission, made many submissions to the Tribunal, and took proceedings before both the Trial Division and this Court, all without challenge to the independence of the Commission.\nIn short, it participated fully in the hearing, and must therefore be taken impliedly to have waived its right to object\n.\" (My emphasis.)",
    "[27]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (the '\nAECL\n' case), in my view, is determinative of this issue.\"",
    "[28]\nFurther, the plaintiff did not allege any particular harm resulting from the infringement of the rules of natural justice. For example, as regards disclosure, the defendant noted that the plaintiff did not allege having been taken by surprise or being prevented from replying. In the defendant's submission, any infringement of a rule of natural justice must have an impact on the final decision if the Court is to intervene. In this regard, the defendant referred to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), in which Tremblay-Lamer, J., said:\n\" [13] Further, even if the rules of natural justice were breached and counsel for the applicant had objected accordingly, as noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and applied by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ultimate decision.\"",
    "[29]\nIn short, I think the plaintiff should have reacted to the alleged breach of the rules of natural justice \"at the first practicable opportunity\", in accordance with\nIn Re Human Rights Tribunal\n, supra, if he really thought there had been an infringement of his rights. By proceeding with his case, the plaintiff waived these arguments. This first point must therefore be dismissed.\n2. Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias as a result of administrative interference?",
    "[30]\nNo: there is no reasonable apprehension of bias resulting from administrative interference.",
    "[31]\nIn\nCommittee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 9 N.R. 115, de Grandpré, J., set out the rule:\n\" [40] The apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information, the test of 'what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - conclude?' There is no real difference between the expression found in the decided cases 'reasonable apprehension of bias', 'reasonable suspicion of bias' or 'real likelihood of bias' but the grounds for the apprehension must be substantial. The question of bias in a member of a court of justice cannot be examined in the same light as that in a member of an administrative tribunal entrusted with an administrative discretion. While the basic principle that natural justice must be rendered is the same its application must take into account the special circumstances of the tribunal. By its nature the National Energy Board must be staffed with persons of experience and expertise. The considerations which underlie its operations are policy oriented. The basic principle in matters of bias must be applied in the light of the circumstances of the case at bar.\"",
    "[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.S.R.(2d) 241; 447 A.P.R. 241, paragraph 112, Cory, J., held that to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias, there must be:\n\"... a 'real probability' of bias, as opposed to a 'mere suspicion'.\"",
    "[33]\nI do not find there were substantial grounds for apprehension or a real probability of bias in the case at bar as defined in\nCommittee for Justice and Liberty\n, supra. Substantial grounds for apprehension or a real probability of bias would be, for example, a member who sat not only at the trial level but also on appeal in the same case; a member who was paid in terms of the number of cases in which he denied parole; or a member who showed a personal prejudice regarding penitentiaries at the hearing. In the case at bar, the fact that the hearing was adjourned for the plaintiff's new release plan to be reviewed does not constitute a valid apprehension of bias.",
    "[34]\nAccording to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 29 F.T.R. 38 (T.D.), the Court should not intervene in NPB decisions unless they were obviously unreasonable:\n\"In the case at bar, where imprisonment and privilege of parole are involved, I am of the view that the administrative decision must not be interfered with by this Court failing clear and unequivocal evidence that the decision is quite unfair and works a serious injustice on the inmate.\"",
    "[35]\nThe Court should not intervene in the case at bar as, contrary to what the plaintiff argued, there is no proof of bias here. Further, the Appeal Division's decision does not meet the test set out by Pinard, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.\nADJOURNMENT OF FIRST LEVEL DECISION",
    "[36]\nOn the adjournment, the plaintiff acknowledged that the NPB may take a decision under advisement after a hearing pursuant to s. 157(4) of the\nRegulations\n, in an application for day parole, and pursuant to s. 158(4) of the\nRegulations\nin the case of full parole. These provisions read as follows:\n\"157(4) The Board may adjourn a day parole review for a period of not more than two months where the Board requires\n(a) further information relevant to the review; or\n(b) further time to render a decision.\n\"158(4) The Board may adjourn a full parole review for a period of not more than two months where the Board requires\n(a) further information relevant to the review; or\n(b) further time to render a decision.\"",
    "[37]\nIn actual fact, the plaintiff's case was not taken under advisement after his hearing. The review was simply postponed so that checks could be made on his release plan. It is reasonable to assume that time was needed to do the necessary checking, as the members found that the information about the release plan was insufficient. Consequently, I do not find that the NPB demonstrated any bias towards the plaintiff. Actually, I feel that by introducing new information the plaintiff by implication agreed to having the checks made. He should have known that such checks would necessarily cause a delay in his case.",
    "[38]\nNaturally the NPB would want to know the details of any new release plan before ruling on the parole, as the NPB is there to protect society. The NPB has a duty to make the necessary checks in order to determine whether the release plan is valid. The members Cadieux and Roussel, once satisfied that the new information had been checked, were still going to resume the hearing.",
    "[39]\nIn short, by introducing a new release plan the plaintiff by implication agreed to the checks being made and accordingly to the NPB decision being delayed. In the circumstances of the case at bar, the plaintiff was not a victim of bias caused by administrative interference in the decision-making process when a new hearing was scheduled for September 30, 1999.",
    "[40]\nFurther, the Appeal Division found that the 47-day delay in responding to the information, and in particular its inadequacy, was normal in view of the summer season. At p. 4 of its decision, the Appeal Division found:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"There is nothing special in the record which would enable us to give a specific answer to this question. It can be assumed that the summer season, vacation and other reasons prevented the two members from jointly resuming this case: it was their responsibility and no one else's, since they had the case before them.\"",
    "[41]\nIn my opinion, the Appeal Division justified the delay, but the plaintiff was still not satisfied. The plaintiff alleged that members Cadieux and Roussel were divested of jurisdiction over his case and that this is indicated by the fact that there was a 47-day delay. The plaintiff is wrong, as the delay is in no way an indication that members Cadieux and Roussel had lost jurisdiction over the case. The question of divestment does not arise in the case at bar. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, he was simply a victim of the administrative process in a vacation period, which is understandable as it was the summer season, thought it was unpleasant for the plaintiff nonetheless.\n3. Was there a breach of the duty to disclose relevant information before the holding of the second hearing?",
    "[42]\nNo, there was no breach of the duty to disclose relevant information before holding the second hearing, as the plaintiff received a copy of the CSC report and so was aware of its contents.",
    "[43]\nThe duty to disclose relevant information before the hearing is contained in s. 141 of the\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act\n(hereinafter \"the\nAct\n\"), set out below:\n\"141(1) At least fifteen days before the day set for the review of the case of an offender, the Board shall provide or cause to be provided to the offender, in writing, in whichever of the two official languages of Canada is requested by the offender, the information that is to be considered in the review of the case or a summary of that information.\n\"(2) Where information referred to in subsection (1) comes into the possession of the Board after the time prescribed in that subsection, that information or a summary of it shall be provided to the offender as soon as is practicable thereafter.\"",
    "[44]\nAccording to the legislation, the relevant information does not have to be disclosed in full: a summary will suffice. The CSC report titled \"Assessment for Decision\" dated December 8, 1999, and prepared by N. Desrosiers, is a summary within the meaning of the\nAct\n. The relevant extracts from the CSC report are as follows:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"The CMT questioned the real motivation of the subject in directing his release plan to New Brunswick, especially as his brother Dan, also a member of the Hell's Angels, was according to the Sûreté du Québec known to be doing 'business' there. We contacted Louis Roger Gagné, Organized Crime Manager, on 8-12-99, and he told us that according to the information he had from the New Brunswick police the Hell's Angels currently control all the drug trafficking in this area. Richard Hudon's coming would be seen as criminal in the area. The same discussion confirmed that Richard's brother Dan Hudon is very well known to the police in that area.\n\"... When questioned about the information at our disposal on Hell's Angels activities in New Brunswick, he said he was not aware of their activities in that province. However, we have reservations about his statements regarding his affiliation to them.\n\"According to a New Brunswick RCMP officer with whom we had a discussion on 8-12-99, the gang is currently reorganizing its entire network in this area. He also confirmed that Daniel Hudon was frequently seen in the area as well as certain members of the Quebec Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. Richard Hudon confirmed that his brother Daniel was in fact expecting to move to New Brunswick in the near future.\n. . . . .\n\"In light of the information at our disposal, the present release plan certainly raises a question about the subject's real motivation in directing his movements towards the New Brunswick area. According to the RCMP, directing Richard Hudon's present release plan to N.B. is not unrelated to the Hell's Angels criminal activities in that area ... In view of the information at our disposal, the CMT does not view the present release plan favourably. First, the subject is not able to propose a specific release plan based on specific needs. Second, it is clear that the information from the RCMP raises still more doubts in our minds about the probability that he will again be involved in unlawful activity.\"",
    "[45]\nThe facts in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 124 F.T.R. 114 (T.D.), are very similar to those in the case at bar. The applicant Mr. Normand was incarcerated in the Leclerc Correctional Institution. He had been convicted of possession of narcotics for the purposes of trafficking, possession of property obtained by crime and having an unregistered loaded weapon in his possession. Additionally, he was a member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. Noël, J., said the following about the evidence and the reports submitted to the NPB:\n\" [25] According to the applicant, the NPB could not base its decision on its own knowledge of criminal biker groups or on the hearsay reputation that these groups have acquired in relation to their violent behaviour. This argument runs up against both the settled principle that a tribunal like the NPB is entitled to use the expertise and experience acquired by its members in the performance of their duties and the duty of the NPB to use all information relevant to the case that is available to it, in making its decision. On this point, the Supreme Court stated in\nMooring\n, after examining the NPB's primary role:\n'In the risk assessment function of the Board, the factors which predominate are those which concern the protection of society. The protection of the accused to ensure a fair trial and maintain the repute of the administration of justice which weighs so heavily in the application of s. 24(2) is overborne by the overriding societal interest. In assessing the risk to society, the emphasis is on ensuring that all reliable information is considered provided it has not been obtained improperly.\n. . . . .\n'Like the basic structure and function of the Parole Board, the language of the Board's enabling statute makes it clear that the Board lacks the ability or jurisdiction to exclude relevant evidence. The language of the\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act\nconfers on the Board a broad inclusionnary mandate. Not only is it not bound to apply the traditional rules of evidence, but it is required to take into account \"all available information that is relevant to a case\". No mention is made of any power to apply exclusionary rules of evidence. Indeed, such a provision would conflict with its duty to consider \"\nall\navailable information that is relevant\"'.\"",
    "[46]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 268 N.R. 235 (F.C.A.), the respondent Zarzour was already on parole but was reincarcerated for failing to report to the Montréal Detention Centre as required by the conditions of his release. On the evidence Décary, Létourneau and Noël, JJ.A., found that the Board's role:\n\"... is to investigate the appropriateness of releasing an individual who has been given a prison term and to ensure that in so doing it does not compromise the primary objective, which is to ensure the protection of society. The following passage by Sopinka, J., extracted from the decision, supra, at pages 92 and 93, accurately summarizes the Board's role and the mandate to include, not exclude, evidence:\n'In the decision currently under review, the Appeal Division of the Board described its function in the following terms:\n\"The function of the Board at a post-suspension review is quite distinct from that of the courts. The Board must decide whether the risk to society of [the respondent's] continued conditional release is undue. In making that determination, the Board will review all information available to it, including any information indicating a return to criminal activity in the community. This applies whether or not the charges in court have been withdrawn, stayed or dismissed.\"'\"",
    "[47]\nIn performing its duty to society the NPB had to consult the CSC report. The plaintiff could have requested a delay so that additional information could be disclosed to him, but did not do so. The members examined the CSC report, as they were required to do. There was no infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information before the second hearing was held, as the plaintiff was in possession of a copy of the CSC report and so was well aware of what he had to answer (Exhibit A-10 of plaintiff's record). Further, the quality of the information contained in the CSC report is beyond question as that information was partly corroborated by the plaintiff and not specifically denied in his affidavit. The fact that at the hearing mention was made of whether his brother, a member of the Hell's Angels, was involved in weapons trafficking in New Brunswick is not a decisive point in the Board's decision.",
    "[48]\nIn conclusion, the plaintiff did not persuade the Court that the Appeal Division's decision on June 12, 2000 was unreasonable or did not comply with the\nAct\n,\nRegulations\nor the rules of natural justice.\nORDER",

The basic principle in matters of bias must be applied in the light of the circumstances of the case at bar.\"\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.S.R.(2d) 241; 447 A.P.R. 241, paragraph 112, Cory, J., held that to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias, there must be:\n\"... a 'real probability' of bias, as opposed to a 'mere suspicion'.\"\n[33]\nI do not find there were substantial grounds for apprehension or a real probability of bias in the case at bar as defined in\nCommittee for Justice and Liberty\n, supra. Substantial grounds for apprehension or a real probability of bias would be, for example, a member who sat not only at the trial level but also on appeal in the same case; a member who was paid in terms of the number of cases in which he denied parole; or a member who showed a personal prejudice regarding penitentiaries at the hearing. In the case at bar, the fact that the hearing was adjourned for the plaintiff's new release plan to be reviewed does not constitute a valid apprehension of bias.\n[34]\nAccording to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 29 F.T.R. 38 (T.D.), the Court should not intervene in NPB decisions unless they were obviously unreasonable:\n\"In the case at bar, where imprisonment and privilege of parole are involved, I am of the view that the administrative decision must not be interfered with by this Court failing clear and unequivocal evidence that the decision is quite unfair and works a serious injustice on the inmate.\"\n[35]\nThe Court should not intervene in the case at bar as, contrary to what the plaintiff argued, there is no proof of bias here. Further, the Appeal Division's decision does not meet the test set out by Pinard, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.\nADJOURNMENT OF FIRST LEVEL DECISION\n[36]\nOn the adjournment, the plaintiff acknowledged that the NPB may take a decision under advisement after a hearing pursuant to s. 157(4) of the\nRegulations\n, in an application for day parole, and pursuant to s. 158(4) of the\nRegulations\nin the case of full parole. These provisions read as follows:\n\"157(4) The Board may adjourn a day parole review for a period of not more than two months where the Board requires\n(a) further information relevant to the review; or\n(b) further time to render a decision.\n\"158(4) The Board may adjourn a full parole review for a period of not more than two months where the Board requires\n(a) further information relevant to the review; or\n(b) further time to render a decision.\"\n[37]\nIn actual fact, the plaintiff's case was not taken under advisement after his hearing. The review was simply postponed so that checks could be made on his release plan. It is reasonable to assume that time was needed to do the necessary checking, as the members found that the information about the release plan was insufficient. Consequently, I do not find that the NPB demonstrated any bias towards the plaintiff. Actually, I feel that by introducing new information the plaintiff by implication agreed to having the checks made. He should have known that such checks would necessarily cause a delay in his case.\n[38]\nNaturally the NPB would want to know the details of any new release plan before ruling on the parole, as the NPB is there to protect society. The NPB has a duty to make the necessary checks in order to determine whether the release plan is valid. The members Cadieux and Roussel, once satisfied that the new information had been checked, were still going to resume the hearing.\n[39]\nIn short, by introducing a new release plan the plaintiff by implication agreed to the checks being made and accordingly to the NPB decision being delayed. In the circumstances of the case at bar, the plaintiff was not a victim of bias caused by administrative interference in the decision-making process when a new hearing was scheduled for September 30, 1999.\n[40]\nFurther, the Appeal Division found that the 47-day delay in responding to the information, and in particular its inadequacy, was normal in view of the summer season. At p. 4 of its decision, the Appeal Division found:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"There is nothing special in the record which would enable us to give a specific answer to this question. It can be assumed that the summer season, vacation and other reasons prevented the two members from jointly resuming this case: it was their responsibility and no one else's, since they had the case before them.\"\n[41]\nIn my opinion, the Appeal Division justified the delay, but the plaintiff was still not satisfied. The plaintiff alleged that members Cadieux and Roussel were divested of jurisdiction over his case and that this is indicated by the fact that there was a 47-day delay. The plaintiff is wrong, as the delay is in no way an indication that members Cadieux and Roussel had lost jurisdiction over the case. The question of divestment does not arise in the case at bar. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, he was simply a victim of the administrative process in a vacation period, which is understandable as it was the summer season, thought it was unpleasant for the plaintiff nonetheless.\n3. Was there a breach of the duty to disclose relevant information before the holding of the second hearing?\n[42]\nNo, there was no breach of the duty to disclose relevant information before holding the second hearing, as the plaintiff received a copy of the CSC report and so was aware of its contents.\n[43]\nThe duty to disclose relevant information before the hearing is contained in s. 141 of the\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act\n(hereinafter \"the\nAct\n\"), set out below:\n\"141(1) At least fifteen days before the day set for the review of the case of an offender, the Board shall provide or cause to be provided to the offender, in writing, in whichever of the two official languages of Canada is requested by the offender, the information that is to be considered in the review of the case or a summary of that information.\n\"(2) Where information referred to in subsection (1) comes into the possession of the Board after the time prescribed in that subsection, that information or a summary of it shall be provided to the offender as soon as is practicable thereafter.\"\n[44]\nAccording to the legislation, the relevant information does not have to be disclosed in full: a summary will suffice. The CSC report titled \"Assessment for Decision\" dated December 8, 1999, and prepared by N. Desrosiers, is a summary within the meaning of the\nAct\n. The relevant extracts from the CSC report are as follows:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"The CMT questioned the real motivation of the subject in directing his release plan to New Brunswick, especially as his brother Dan, also a member of the Hell's Angels, was according to the Sûreté du Québec known to be doing 'business' there. We contacted Louis Roger Gagné, Organized Crime Manager, on 8-12-99, and he told us that according to the information he had from the New Brunswick police the Hell's Angels currently control all the drug trafficking in this area. Richard Hudon's coming would be seen as criminal in the area. The same discussion confirmed that Richard's brother Dan Hudon is very well known to the police in that area.\n\"... When questioned about the information at our disposal on Hell's Angels activities in New Brunswick, he said he was not aware of their activities in that province. However, we have reservations about his statements regarding his affiliation to them.\n\"According to a New Brunswick RCMP officer with whom we had a discussion on 8-12-99, the gang is currently reorganizing its entire network in this area. He also confirmed that Daniel Hudon was frequently seen in the area as well as certain members of the Quebec Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. Richard Hudon confirmed that his brother Daniel was in fact expecting to move to New Brunswick in the near future.\n. . . . .\n\"In light of the information at our disposal, the present release plan certainly raises a question about the subject's real motivation in directing his movements towards the New Brunswick area. According to the RCMP, directing Richard Hudon's present release plan to N.B. is not unrelated to the Hell's Angels criminal activities in that area ... In view of the information at our disposal, the CMT does not view the present release plan favourably. First, the subject is not able to propose a specific release plan based on specific needs. Second, it is clear that the information from the RCMP raises still more doubts in our minds about the probability that he will again be involved in unlawful activity.\"\n[45]\nThe facts in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 124 F.T.R. 114 (T.D.), are very similar to those in the case at bar. The applicant Mr. Normand was incarcerated in the Leclerc Correctional Institution. He had been convicted of possession of narcotics for the purposes of trafficking, possession of property obtained by crime and having an unregistered loaded weapon in his possession. Additionally, he was a member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang. Noël, J., said the following about the evidence and the reports submitted to the NPB:\n\"[25] According to the applicant, the NPB could not base its decision on its own knowledge of criminal biker groups or on the hearsay reputation that these groups have acquired in relation to their violent behaviour. This argument runs up against both the settled principle that a tribunal like the NPB is entitled to use the expertise and experience acquired by its members in the performance of their duties and the duty of the NPB to use all information relevant to the case that is available to it, in making its decision. On this point, the Supreme Court stated in\nMooring\n, after examining the NPB's primary role:\n'In the risk assessment function of the Board, the factors which predominate are those which concern the protection of society. The protection of the accused to ensure a fair trial and maintain the repute of the administration of justice which weighs so heavily in the application of s. 24(2) is overborne by the overriding societal interest. In assessing the risk to society, the emphasis is on ensuring that all reliable information is considered provided it has not been obtained improperly.\n. . . . .\n'Like the basic structure and function of the Parole Board, the language of the Board's enabling statute makes it clear that the Board lacks the ability or jurisdiction to exclude relevant evidence. The language of the\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act\nconfers on the Board a broad inclusionnary mandate. Not only is it not bound to apply the traditional rules of evidence, but it is required to take into account \"all available information that is relevant to a case\". No mention is made of any power to apply exclusionary rules of evidence. Indeed, such a provision would conflict with its duty to consider \"\nall\navailable information that is relevant\"'.\"\n[46]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 268 N.R. 235 (F.C.A.), the respondent Zarzour was already on parole but was reincarcerated for failing to report to the Montréal Detention Centre as required by the conditions of his release. On the evidence Décary, Létourneau and Noël, JJ.A., found that the Board's role:\n\"... is to investigate the appropriateness of releasing an individual who has been given a prison term and to ensure that in so doing it does not compromise the primary objective, which is to ensure the protection of society. The following passage by Sopinka, J., extracted from the decision, supra, at pages 92 and 93, accurately summarizes the Board's role and the mandate to include, not exclude, evidence:\n'In the decision currently under review, the Appeal Division of the Board described its function in the following terms:\n\"The function of the Board at a post-suspension review is quite distinct from that of the courts. The Board must decide whether the risk to society of [the respondent's] continued conditional release is undue. In making that determination, the Board will review all information available to it, including any information indicating a return to criminal activity in the community. This applies whether or not the charges in court have been withdrawn, stayed or dismissed.\"'\"\n[47]\nIn performing its duty to society the NPB had to consult the CSC report. The plaintiff could have requested a delay so that additional information could be disclosed to him, but did not do so. The members examined the CSC report, as they were required to do. There was no infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information before the second hearing was held, as the plaintiff was in possession of a copy of the CSC report and so was well aware of what he had to answer (Exhibit A-10 of plaintiff's record). Further, the quality of the information contained in the CSC report is beyond question as that information was partly corroborated by the plaintiff and not specifically denied in his affidavit. The fact that at the hearing mention was made of whether his brother, a member of the Hell's Angels, was involved in weapons trafficking in New Brunswick is not a decisive point in the Board's decision.\n[48]\nIn conclusion, the plaintiff did not persuade the Court that the Appeal Division's decision on June 12, 2000 was unreasonable or did not comply with the\nAct\n,\nRegulations\nor the rules of natural justice.\nORDER\n[49]\nThe instant application for judicial review is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/djc",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nBlais, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review seeking to determine the legality of a decision by the Appeal Division (hereinafter \"the Appeal Division\") of the National Parole Board (hereinafter \"the NPB\") on June 12, 2000 by members M. Charbonneau and A. Bachand in which the Appeal Division approved the initial decision.\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATION\n\n[2]\nThe defendant asked that pursuant to s. 303(2) of the\nFederal Court Rules\n(1998), the Attorney General of Canada be named as defendant in this case, not the NPB: the request was approved and the Attorney General of Canada will henceforth be named as defendant.\nFACTS\n\n[3]\nThe plaintiff Richard Hudon was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment for conspiracy to import narcotics on November 17, 1994.\n\n[4]\nThe plaintiff is a member of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang.\n\n[5]\nThe plaintiff has been eligible for day parole since January 16, 1997 and full parole since March 18, 1999.\n\n[6]\nConsequently, on July 20, 1999 the plaintiff had a hearing before the members P. Cadieux and G. Roussel.\n\n[7]\nDuring that hearing the plaintiff submitted a new release plan, namely taking a \"bricklaying\" training program. Accordingly, the NPB asked Correctional Service Canada (hereinafter \"CSC\") to provide new information.\n\n[8]\nOn July 21 and 23, 1999 a memorandum was sent by CSC and representations made by counsel for the plaintiff indicating that the information requested by the NPB was not available.\n\n[9]\nOn July 28, 1999 in\nNPB Pre-Release Decision Sheet\n, the NPB decided that the decision should be postponed until additional information was received regarding implementation of the plaintiff's new release plan.\n\n[10]\nThis additional information was forwarded by the plaintiff's case management officer, N. Desrosiers, on August 4, 1999.\n\n[11]\nOn September 15, 1999 the NPB informed the plaintiff that a new hearing of his case had been scheduled for September 30, 1999.\n\n[12]\nOn September 20, 1999 the plaintiff received a letter from members Cadieux and Roussel indicating that the additional information provided on August 4, 1999 was insufficient since there was no specific reply regarding acceptance of the plaintiff's candidacy for the \"bricklaying\" program.\n\n[13]\nThe members then asked CSC to send them further written clarifications, and in the meantime decided to delete the plaintiff's case from the hearing roll for September 30, 1999.\n\n[14]\nOn October 4, 1999 the NPB received a new report from CSC indicating that it was impossible for the plaintiff to proceed with his training as a \"bricklayer\" as part of specialized training.\n\n[15]\nOn October 5, 1999 the NPB informed the plaintiff that he would have another hearing before members Cadieux and Roussel.\n\n[16]\nOn December 8, 1999 another general assessment was sent to the NPB by CSC and the plaintiff again changed his release plan, this time to New Brunswick.\n\n[17]\nOn January 26, 2000, as promised, the plaintiff was again heard by members Cadieux and Roussel. The NPB's final decision was to deny the plaintiff any form of parole.\n\n[18]\nThe plaintiff appealed this decision to the Appeal Division before members M. Charbonneau and A. Bachand, alleging a reasonable apprehension of bias and infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information prior to the holding of the second hearing.\n\n[19]\nOn June 12, 2000 the Appeal Division affirmed the first level decision and dismissed the plaintiff's appeal.\n\n[20]\nConsequently, on July 14, 2000 the plaintiff filed an application for judicial review.\nPOINTS AT ISSUE\n\n[21]\n1. Should the plaintiff first have made the allegations of infringements of the rules of natural justice (institutional independence, bias and disclosure) to the first level? If so, should the instant application for judicial review fail without it being necessary to go any further?\n2. Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias as a result of administrative interference?\n3. Was there an infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information before the second hearing was held?\nDECISION SOUGHT\n\n[22]\nThe plaintiff is asking this Court to allow the instant application for judicial review and quash the decision by the Appeal Division on June 12, 2000.\nANALYSIS\n1. Should the plaintiff have first made the allegations of infringements of the rules of natural justice to the first level?\n\n[23]\nYes, the plaintiff should have raised the arguments of institutional independence, bias and disclosure at the first level.\n\n[24]\nThe defendant submitted that it is well-settled law that questions of infringement of the rules of natural justice (institutional independence, bias and disclosure) should be raised before the tribunal in question. In his submission, the tribunal hearing the case is in the best position to intervene from the outset. In the case at bar, for example, on the allegation of bias, the plaintiff could have asked the NPB to decline to rule or, on the allegation of a lack of disclosure, asked for further time in which information could be disclosed to him. Specifically, by raising the question at the first practicable opportunity the plaintiff would have shown that he really believed that his case was in danger.\n\n[25]\nThe questions of institutional independence, bias and disclosure were not raised before the first level members for the first time but on appeal, and now on judicial review. In the defendant's opinion the plaintiff, by not raising these arguments at the first practicable opportunity, gave up his right to make them. That is exactly what the Appeal Division concluded at p. 4 of its decision:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"Additionally, on listening to the resumed hearing of January 26, 2000 we noted that your counsel did not see fit to submit any argument to the members regarding the alleged infringement of the rules of natural justice, in the sense that he made this submission to the Appeal Division.\"\n\n[26]\nThe defendant referred to\nEnergy and Chemical Workers' Union and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Re\n, [1986] 1 F.C. 103; 64 N.R. 126 (F.C.A.), in which MacGuigan, J.A., said at 113  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\"However, even apart from this express waiver, AECL's whole course of conduct before the Tribunal constituted an implied waiver of any assertion of a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal.\nThe only reasonable course of conduct for a party reasonably apprehensive of bias would be to allege a violation of natural justice at the earliest practicable opportunity\n. Here, AECL called witnesses, cross-examined the witnesses called by the Commission, made many submissions to the Tribunal, and took proceedings before both the Trial Division and this Court, all without challenge to the independence of the Commission.\nIn short, it participated fully in the hearing, and must therefore be taken impliedly to have waived its right to object\n.\" (My emphasis.)\n\n[27]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (the '\nAECL\n' case), in my view, is determinative of this issue.\"\n\n[28]\nFurther, the plaintiff did not allege any particular harm resulting from the infringement of the rules of natural justice. For example, as regards disclosure, the defendant noted that the plaintiff did not allege having been taken by surprise or being prevented from replying. In the defendant's submission, any infringement of a rule of natural justice must have an impact on the final decision if the Court is to intervene. In this regard, the defendant referred to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), in which Tremblay-Lamer, J., said:\n\" [13] Further, even if the rules of natural justice were breached and counsel for the applicant had objected accordingly, as noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and applied by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ultimate decision.\"\n\n[29]\nIn short, I think the plaintiff should have reacted to the alleged breach of the rules of natural justice \"at the first practicable opportunity\", in accordance with\nIn Re Human Rights Tribunal\n, supra, if he really thought there had been an infringement of his rights. By proceeding with his case, the plaintiff waived these arguments. This first point must therefore be dismissed.\n2. Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias as a result of administrative interference?\n\n[30]\nNo: there is no reasonable apprehension of bias resulting from administrative interference.\n\n[31]\nIn\nCommittee for Justice and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 9 N.R. 115, de Grandpré, J., set out the rule:\n\" [40] The apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information, the test of 'what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - conclude?' There is no real difference between the expression found in the decided cases 'reasonable apprehension of bias', 'reasonable suspicion of bias' or 'real likelihood of bias' but the grounds for the apprehension must be substantial. The question of bias in a member of a court of justice cannot be examined in the same light as that in a member of an administrative tribunal entrusted with an administrative discretion. While the basic principle that natural justice must be rendered is the same its application must take into account the special circumstances of the tribunal. By its nature the National Energy Board must be staffed with persons of experience and expertise. The considerations which underlie its operations are policy oriented. The basic principle in matters of bias must be applied in the light of the circumstances of the case at bar.\"\n\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.S.R.(2d) 241; 447 A.P.R. 241, paragraph 112, Cory, J., held that to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias, there must be:\n\"... a 'real probability' of bias, as opposed to a 'mere suspicion'.\"\n\n[33]\nI do not find there were substantial grounds for apprehension or a real probability of bias in the case at bar as defined in\nCommittee for Justice and Liberty\n, supra. Substantial grounds for apprehension or a real probability of bias would be, for example, a member who sat not only at the trial level but also on appeal in the same case; a member who was paid in terms of the number of cases in which he denied parole; or a member who showed a personal prejudice regarding penitentiaries at the hearing. In the case at bar, the fact that the hearing was adjourned for the plaintiff's new release plan to be reviewed does not constitute a valid apprehension of bias.\n\n[34]\nAccording to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 29 F.T.R. 38 (T.D.), the Court should not intervene in NPB decisions unless they were obviously unreasonable:\n\"In the case at bar, where imprisonment and privilege of parole are involved, I am of the view that the administrative decision must not be interfered with by this Court failing clear and unequivocal evidence that the decision is quite unfair and works a serious injustice on the inmate.\"\n\n[35]\nThe Court should not intervene in the case at bar as, contrary to what the plaintiff argued, there is no proof of bias here. Further, the Appeal Division's decision does not meet the test set out by Pinard, J., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra.\nADJOURNMENT OF FIRST LEVEL DECISION\n\n[36]\nOn the adjournment, the plaintiff acknowledged that the NPB may take a decision under advisement after a hearing pursuant to s. 157(4) of the\nRegulations\n, in an application for day parole, and pursuant to s. 158(4) of the\nRegulations\nin the case of full parole. These provisions read as follows:\n\"157(4) The Board may adjourn a day parole review for a period of not more than two months where the Board requires\n(a) further information relevant to the review; or\n(b) further time to render a decision.\n\"158(4) The Board may adjourn a full parole review for a period of not more than two months where the Board requires\n(a) further information relevant to the review; or\n(b) further time to render a decision.\"\n\n[37]\nIn actual fact, the plaintiff's case was not taken under advisement after his hearing. The review was simply postponed so that checks could be made on his release plan. It is reasonable to assume that time was needed to do the necessary checking, as the members found that the information about the release plan was insufficient. Consequently, I do not find that the NPB demonstrated any bias towards the plaintiff. Actually, I feel that by introducing new information the plaintiff by implication agreed to having the checks made. He should have known that such checks would necessarily cause a delay in his case.\n\n[38]\nNaturally the NPB would want to know the details of any new release plan before ruling on the parole, as the NPB is there to protect society. The NPB has a duty to make the necessary checks in order to determine whether the release plan is valid. The members Cadieux and Roussel, once satisfied that the new information had been checked, were still going to resume the hearing.\n\n[39]\nIn short, by introducing a new release plan the plaintiff by implication agreed to the checks being made and accordingly to the NPB decision being delayed. In the circumstances of the case at bar, the plaintiff was not a victim of bias caused by administrative interference in the decision-making process when a new hearing was scheduled for September 30, 1999.\n\n[40]\nFurther, the Appeal Division found that the 47-day delay in responding to the information, and in particular its inadequacy, was normal in view of the summer season. At p. 4 of its decision, the Appeal Division found:\n(TRANSLATION)\n\"There is nothing special in the record which would enable us to give a specific answer to this question.

The plaintiff alleged that members Cadieux and Roussel were divested of jurisdiction over his case and that this is indicated by the fact that there was a 47-day delay. The plaintiff is wrong, as the delay is in no way an indication that members Cadieux and Roussel had lost jurisdiction over the case. The question of divestment does not arise in the case at bar. Unfortunately for the plaintiff, he was simply a victim of the administrative process in a vacation period, which is understandable as it was the summer season, thought it was unpleasant for the plaintiff nonetheless.\n3. Was there a breach of the duty to disclose relevant information before the holding of the second hearing?\n\n[42]\nNo, there was no breach of the duty to disclose relevant information before holding the second hearing, as the plaintiff received a copy of the CSC report and so was aware of its contents.\n\n[43]\nThe duty to disclose relevant information before the hearing is contained in s. 141 of the\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act\n(hereinafter \"the\nAct\n\"), set out below:\n\"141(1) At least fifteen days before the day set for the review of the case of an offender, the Board shall provide or cause to be provided to the offender, in writing, in whichever of the two official languages of Canada is requested by the offender, the information that is to be considered in the review of the case or a summary of that information.\n\"(2) Where information referred to in subsection (1) comes into the possession of the Board after the time prescribed in that subsection, that information or a summary of it shall be provided to the offender as soon as is practicable thereafter.\"\n\n[44]\nAccording to the legislation, the relevant information does not have to be disclosed in full: a summary will suffice.

On the evidence Décary, Létourneau and Noël, JJ.A., found that the Board's role:\n\"... is to investigate the appropriateness of releasing an individual who has been given a prison term and to ensure that in so doing it does not compromise the primary objective, which is to ensure the protection of society. The following passage by Sopinka, J., extracted from the decision, supra, at pages 92 and 93, accurately summarizes the Board's role and the mandate to include, not exclude, evidence:\n'In the decision currently under review, the Appeal Division of the Board described its function in the following terms:\n\"The function of the Board at a post-suspension review is quite distinct from that of the courts. The Board must decide whether the risk to society of [the respondent's] continued conditional release is undue. In making that determination, the Board will review all information available to it, including any information indicating a return to criminal activity in the community. This applies whether or not the charges in court have been withdrawn, stayed or dismissed.\"'\"\n\n[47]\nIn performing its duty to society the NPB had to consult the CSC report. The plaintiff could have requested a delay so that additional information could be disclosed to him, but did not do so. The members examined the CSC report, as they were required to do. There was no infringement of the duty to disclose relevant information before the second hearing was held, as the plaintiff was in possession of a copy of the CSC report and so was well aware of what he had to answer (Exhibit A-10 of plaintiff's record). Further, the quality of the information contained in the CSC report is beyond question as that information was partly corroborated by the plaintiff and not specifically denied in his affidavit. The fact that at the hearing mention was made of whether his brother, a member of the Hell's Angels, was involved in weapons trafficking in New Brunswick is not a decisive point in the Board's decision.\n\n[48]\nIn conclusion, the plaintiff did not persuade the Court that the Appeal Division's decision on June 12, 2000 was unreasonable or did not comply with the\nAct\n,\nRegulations\nor the rules of natural justice.\nORDER\n\n[49]\nThe instant application for judicial review is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E.

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found the plaintiff should have raised arguments regarding natural justice (institutional independence, bias, and disclosure) at the initial NPB level, as that body is best positioned to address such concerns promptly. Failure to do so constituted a waiver of those arguments, based on precedent in *Energy and Chemical Workers' Union and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.*, where a party's full participation without objecting to bias implies waiver.",
      "The court determined there was no reasonable apprehension of bias resulting from administrative interference. It applied the test from *Committee for Justice and Liberty*, requiring substantial grounds or a real probability of bias, which were not present in this case. The adjournment for review of the release plan was considered reasonable and did not indicate bias.",
      "The court upheld the NPB's decision to postpone the hearing to review the plaintiff’s new release plan, finding it a legitimate step to ensure adequate information was available. The court emphasized the NPB’s duty to protect society and the reasonableness of verifying the new plan.",
      "The court found no breach of the duty to disclose relevant information, as the plaintiff received a summary report from Correctional Service Canada (CSC) that satisfied the requirements of s. 141 of the *Corrections and Conditional Release Act*. The court cited *Normand* and *Zarzour* to support the NPB’s broad mandate to consider all relevant information, even if it’s not presented in a specific format.",
      "The court deferred to the NPB’s expertise and discretion, stating that intervention is only warranted if the decision is “obviously unreasonable,” as per *Pinard*. It found no evidence of unreasonableness or unfairness in the NPB’s decision-making process.",
      "The court found the Appeal Division’s justification for the delay in responding to information (summer season) reasonable and did not support a claim of lost jurisdiction. The plaintiff was simply affected by administrative delays, which are understandable."
