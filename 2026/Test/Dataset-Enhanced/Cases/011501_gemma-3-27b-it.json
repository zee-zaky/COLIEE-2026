Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nKane, J.\n: The applicant, Mr Syed Waqas Ali Gilani, seeks judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nSC 2001, c 27 [\nIRPA\n] of a decision made by an Immigration Officer [the Officer] at the Canada Immigration Centre, Etobicoke, Ontario, dated March 16, 2012, refusing his claim for permanent residence as a member of the Spouse or Common-law partner in Canada class, because he had not satisfied Regulation 124(a) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [\nIRPR\n] which requires an applicant to demonstrate that the applicant is the spouse of a sponsor and that the applicant cohabits with the sponsor in Canada.",
    "[2]\nFor the reasons that follow the application is dismissed.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nMr Gilani is a citizen of Pakistan who arrived in Canada in 2003. He married his sponsor, Rossana De Santis, a permanent resident of Canada, on May 24, 2006. In January, 2008, Mr Gilani's application for permanent residence was approved in principle.",
    "[4]\nLater in 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] received a tip, referred to as a \"poison pen letter\" which claimed that the applicant's marriage was one of convenience, and that the applicant was paying his sponsor as a part of the agreement. In 2011, the Canadian Border Services Agency [CBSA] conducted an investigation, either in response to the tip or as part of a broader probe, which led to the applicant's arrest in October, 2011.",
    "[5]\nAs a result of surveillance, CBSA found that the applicant was not residing with his spouse and sponsor, but rather with his sister and brother-in-law. CBSA also found that his cell phone bill was sent to his sister's address and his car was parked at this address and never at his sponsor's home address. CBSA also noted that his spouse and sponsor, a recipient of an Ontario Disability Support Pension [ODSP], had not advised ODSP that she was married, and still indicated her status as \"single\".",
    "[6]\nFollowing the applicant's release from detention following his arrest, he returned to his sponsor's residence. CIC sent a procedural fairness letter on October 12, 2011 setting out the allegations that the applicant was not cohabiting with his sponsor. The applicant provided submissions in reply and statutory declarations from relatives and friends who attested that the applicant and sponsor were married but had been apart for a period of time in 2011.",
    "[7]\nThe applicant and sponsor were interviewed by the Officer on March 15, 2012.\nThe Decision under Review",
    "[8]\nThe Officer determined that the applicant had satisfied the eligibility requirements to apply for permanent resident status in the spouse and common-law partner in Canada class, but failed to demonstrate that he \"cohabits with (his) sponsor in Canada\" as required by Regulation 124(a) of the\nIRPR\n.",
    "[9]\nThe Officer considered the evidence from CBSA and the applicant's submissions in response to the procedural fairness letter which explained that he spent some nights at his sister's home to help with her young family and because of its proximity to his work and also because he and his sponsor had some conflicts following her miscarriage in November 2010 which led him to leave in January, 2011, but that the time apart was not intended as a separation.",
    "[10]\nThe Officer referred to the statutory declarations from friends and family in support of the applicant's assertion that he and his sponsor were married and that their time apart was temporary and due to the miscarriage and other reasons, including the proximity of his sister's home to his work and his assistance to his sister and her young children, but attributed little weight to these declarations because they came from relatives and friends closely tied to the applicant and were self-serving.",
    "[11]\nThe Officer considered the explanations and information provided at the March 15, 2011 interview with the applicant and his sponsor, and found that the applicant lacked basic information about the sponsor's pregnancy and miscarriage, and that his answers were not consistent with his sponsor's answers. With respect to the cell phone bill, the Officer concluded that it was more likely that it was sent to his sister and brother-in-law's address because the applicant lived there, rather than because the applicant's brother-in-law was paying the bill. With respect to the sponsor's status as single for the purpose of her ODSP benefits, the Officer found that while the sponsor indicated that this was a mistake which she had taken steps to clarify, there was no evidence that she had done so.",
    "[12]\nThe Officer also noted that the applicant had few answers or explanations at the time of his arrest and his answers and explanations at the time of the interview were likely made up and the result of having time to prepare.",
    "[13]\nThe Officer clearly stated that he gave no weight to the \"poison pen letter\", but relied on the results of the CBSA investigation and the submissions of the applicant in response, including the interview.",
    "[14]\nThe Officer acknowledged that the applicant and his sponsor appeared to have resided together after his release from detention in October, 2011 and that a couple need not spend every night together in the same home. However, the Officer concluded that it appeared that the applicant and his sponsor were not cohabiting from January, 2011, or earlier, until the time of his arrest.\nThe Issues",
    "[15]\nThe applicant submits that the decision should be quashed on four grounds. First, the Officer unreasonably gave low probative weight to relevant and corroborative evidence, namely the statutory declarations of family and friends. Second, the Officer made unreasonable findings of fact with respect to the couple's cohabitation, the pregnancy and the CBSA investigation. Third, the Officer made veiled findings about the genuineness of the marriage and conflated cohabitation with genuineness. Fourth, the Officer breached principles of procedural fairness by not disclosing the details of the poison pen letter.",
    "[16]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer's decision was reasonable based on his assessment of all the evidence and that the applicant is, in essence, asking the court to reweigh evidence, which is not the role of the Court.\nStandard of review",
    "[17]\nThe parties agree that in accordance with\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there are only two standards of review: correctness for questions of law and reasonableness involving questions of mixed fact and law. A finding of cohabitation is a factual determination and reviewed against a standard of reasonableness:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nSaid\n] at para 18.",
    "[18]\nThe relevant provision of the Regulations governing the spouse of common-law partner class is the following:\n124. A foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they\n(\nhas\n) are the spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;\n(\nb\n) have temporary resident status in Canada; and\n(\nc\n) are the subject of a sponsorship application.\n124. A foreigner who meets the following conditions is part of the category of spouse or common-law partner in Canada:\n(a) he is the spouse or common-law partner of a guarantor and lives with that guarantor in Canada;\n(b) he holds temporary resident status in Canada;\nc) a sponsorship application has been filed in his regard.\nDid the Officer breach principles of procedural fairness by not disclosing the poison pen letter?",
    "[19]\nThe Officer clearly stated that he gave the \"poison pen letter\" no weight. The Officer relied on the CBSA investigation, the results of which were disclosed to the applicant in the procedural fairness letter sent in October, 2011. In addition, the contents of the poison pen letter, even though no weight was given to it, were disclosed to the applicant and his sponsor at the interview and they had an opportunity to respond. As noted by Justice Mosley in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"poison pen letter\" need not be disclosed if the allegations are made known to the applicant. [13] Moreover, the applicant's contention that there was a breach of procedural fairness because the letter or its particulars were not disclosed to the applicant or her husband is without merit. It has been held that a \"poison pen letter\" does not necessarily have to be disclosed to an applicant so long as the applicant is made aware of the allegations contained therein:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 315 at para. 14. This is what occurred here. During the applicant's husband's interview, the visa officer explicitly indicated that they had received an anonymous letter and gave him the opportunity to respond to the visa officer's concerns: Visa Officer's Decision, Applicant's Record, pgs. 50-52. No breaches of natural justice can said to have been committed.",
    "[20]\nSimilarly, in this case there was no breach of procedural fairness.\nDid the Officer make veiled findings regarding the genuineness of the marriage?",
    "[21]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer conflated the requirements that a marriage be genuine with the cohabitation requirement and made veiled findings about the genuineness of the marriage. I do not agree. While the Officer referred to the CBSA report as suggesting that the \"couple is not cohabiting in a genuine marital relationship\", it is clear from the CBSA investigation and from the Officer's decision as a whole that he was focused on the cohabitation requirement. In addition, it is well settled that failure to meet any of the requirements of Regulation 124 is fatal. If there is no cohabitation with the spouse and sponsor, the applicant is not eligible.",
    "[22]\nAs noted by Justice Russell in\nSaid\nat para 34:\n34 ..... If there was no cohabitation then sponsorship was not possible. There was no reason to consider whether the marriage \"was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act\" as set out in section 4 of the Regulations. The issue for the Officer was not about why the marriage was entered into, but whether the Applicant and his Sponsor were cohabitating at the time of the application. I see no reasonable error on this point. [35] ..... Further, Justice Shore held in\nLaabou,\nabove, at paragraph 27, that the failure to meet any of the conditions in subsection 124(a) of the Regulations is fatal to the claim. Whether or not their marriage was genuine, the fact remains - as reasonably found by the Officer - that the Applicant and his Sponsor are not cohabiting. This is sufficient to exclude him from the Spouse in Canada class.",
    "[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 190, Justice Boivin referred to the criteria in Regulation 124 and noted, at para 11: [11] Failure to meet one of the above-mentioned conditions is fatal to the applicant's application for permanent residence. Essentially, the applicant is asking this Court to consider the concerns raised by the officer and the explanations provided by the applicant in reply and to reweigh those explanations and arrive at a different conclusion, which is not the role of this Court\n.\nDid the Officer reject corroborating evidence?",
    "[24]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer erred in rejecting the corroborating evidence which supported the applicant's claim that he and his sponsor had been married for six years and, although they had been apart for almost a year, this was not a permanent separation and was due to the conflict following the miscarriage. The applicant submits that the Officer erred in giving the statutory declarations of family low probative weight because they were self serving and from persons with close ties to the applicant, and that the Officer failed to consider the declarations from the friends. The applicant, relying on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], argues that evidence can not be rejected only because it is self serving. The applicant notes that those who submitted the declarations are the best placed to describe the relationship and the reasons for the applicant's time away from his sponsor.",
    "[25]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer was entitled to attribute low weight to the statutory declarations and that he did not do so solely on the basis that the declarations came from family and friends with close ties. The respondent submits that the Officer analysed the contents of the declarations, referred to this information in his decision, and weighed all this information against the evidence provided in the CBSA investigation.",
    "[26]\nAs noted by Justice de Montigny in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [26] However, jurisprudence has established that,\ndepending on the circumstances\n,\nevidence should not be disregarded simply because it emanates from individuals connected to the persons concerned\n:\nR v Laboucan,\n2010 SCC 12, at para 11. As counsel for the Respondent rightly notes,\nLaboucan\nconcerned a criminal matter; however, immigration jurisprudence from this Court has established the same principle. Indeed, several immigration cases hold that giving evidence little weight because it comes from a friend or relative is an error.",
    "[27] For example, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Dawson held at paragraph 25 that, \"solicitation does not per se invalidate the contents of the letter, nor does the fact that the letter was written by a relative.\" Likewise, Justice Phelan noted the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nThe Officer gives little weight to other witnesses' affidavit evidence because it comes from a close family friend and a cousin. The Officer fails to explain from whom such evidence should come other than friends and family.\nSimilarly, Justice Mactavish stated the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nWith respect to [\nsic\n] letter from the President of the organization, I do not understand the Board's criticism of the letter as being \"self-serving\", as it is likely that any evidence submitted by an applicant will be beneficial to his or her case, and could thus be characterized as 'self-serving'.",
    "[28] In light of this jurisprudence, and under the circumstances, I do not believe it was reasonable for the Officer to award this evidence low probative value simply because it came from the Applicants' family members. Presumably, the Officer would have preferred letters written by individuals who had no ties to the Applicants and who were not invested in the Applicants' well-being. However, it is not reasonable to expect that anyone unconnected to the Applicants would have been able to furnish this kind of evidence regarding what had happened to the Applicants in Mexico. The Applicants' family members were the individuals who observed their alleged persecution, so these family members are the people best-positioned to give evidence relating to those events. In addition, since the family members were themselves targeted after the Applicants' departure, it is appropriate that they offer first-hand descriptions of the events that they experienced.\nTherefore, it was unreasonable of the Officer to distrust this evidence simply because it came from individuals connected to the Applicants\n. (emphasis added) [27]\nOther cases have looked at the particular circumstances and reiterated that evidence should not be discounted\nsolely\nbecause it is self serving. An additional passage in\nAhmed\n, is relevant, where Justice Mactavish applied that principle: [32] That said, although there are problems with the Board's findings regarding the evidentiary value of the letter in assessing the nature of Mr. Ahmed's involvement with the Anjuman Hussainia, these findings were not patently unreasonable. The Board noted that the letter was written long after the alleged incidents took place, and made no reference to any of Mr. Ahmed's accomplishments or specific responsibilities within the Anjuman organization. Further, the Board's negative credibility finding regarding Mr. Ahmed's problems with the SSP did not hinge solely on this letter. The Board questioned several aspects of his claim, including the very existence of a tailor shop, and the extent of Mr. Ahmed's involvement in the rally. In these circumstances, it was not patently unreasonable for the Board to view this letter as being of little probative value. [28]\nSimilarly in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Teitelbaum stated that while it is an error to attribute little probative value on the basis that the documents are self serving, other basis may support the low probative value attributed.",
    "[29]\nThe two issues raised by the applicant with respect to the declarations are related: whether the Officer assigned low probative value only because of the source of the declarations or for other reasons after an analysis of their contents; and, whether the Officer was required to specifically mention each one.",
    "[30]\nThe Officer referred to the statutory declarations from family and friends and he indicated that he gave \"these documents\" little weight. There is nothing on the record to suggest that the Officer ignored some of the declarations.",
    "[31]\nThe applicant submits that although the Officer says he considered all the evidence, he ignored the supporting declarations from friends. The applicant relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Evans noted at para 17 that \"Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.\"",
    "[32]\nI would also note the words of Justice Near in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  with respect to the applicability of this principle: [16] The Applicant relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 264, for the proposition that the Board committed a reviewable error by not at least acknowledging evidence that contradicted its finding regarding the Applicant's credibility. Cepeda is a seminal case often cited on judicial review when the Board has come to a conclusion that differs from information contained in a piece of evidence submitted by the Applicant. In this particular context it is important to remember that the general principle to be distilled from Cepeda's evolution into an all-purpose documentary evidence citation is that the more probative the evidence, the more likely the Court will find error when the Board ignores it (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 394 at para 9).",
    "[33]\nIn this case, the Officer did not make any blanket statements about the statutory declarations. The Officer referred to the declarations from family and friends both generally and specifically. The Officer referred to the statutory declarations of the family members in consideration of the applicant's explanation for spending nights at his sister's home and the Officer referred to the brother-in-law's declaration regarding the address on the cell phone bill and to the sponsor's declaration regarding her single status for the purpose of the ODSP benefits.",
    "[34]\nWhile the Officer did not specifically refer to each of the statutory declarations from friends, he referred to his consideration of all the evidence before him. It must be recalled that the declarations were similar in content and the fact that the applicant and his sponsor had not been together since at least January, 2011 was not in dispute.",
    "[35]\nThe Officer acknowledged that the declarations sought to provide explanations for the applicant's time away from his sponsor, but based on the assessment of all the evidence, both in support and against, he gave the declarations low weight. As the respondent submits, the Officer was entitled to weigh all the evidence supporting the applicant with all the evidence provided by the CBSA investigation and the interviews and attribute low weight to the statutory declarations. The Court can not engage in a reweighing of the evidence.",
    "[36]\nI do not agree that the Officer overlooked or ignored any of the declarations or that he assigned low probative value only because the declarations were provided by his sister and brother-in-law and by neighbors.",
    "[37]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Reilly considered the reasonableness of an Officer's decision that found the applicant and his spousal sponsor were not cohabiting and found that while there was evidence supporting the claim that the couple lived together, there was also contrary evidence. The Officer's decision which canvassed all the evidence was not unreasonable as it fell within the range of acceptable outcomes, based on the facts and the law.\nDid the Officer make unreasonable findings of fact?",
    "[38]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer erred in making unreasonable findings of fact on three significant issues; the couple's cohabitation; the pregnancy; and, the results of the CBSA investigation.\nCohabitation",
    "[39]\nFirst the applicant argues that the Officer failed to consider the applicable Operations Manual, OP 2, which provides guidance to officers about the meaning of cohabitation and which notes that while cohabitation means living together continuously, some separations which are temporary and short are contemplated. The applicant submits that although he was staying at his sister's home after the miscarriage, he also spent time with his sponsor and her children and, as noted in their statutory declarations, their separation was temporary. The applicant further submits that the Officer failed to consider that the couple have lived together continuously since his release from detention following his arrest in October, 2011.",
    "[40]\nThe respondent agrees that OP 2 contemplates exceptions to cohabitation such as absences due to work or illness of a short and temporary nature, but not due to relationship problems. The Officer based his findings with respect to cohabitation on all the evidence. Given that the Officer found that the sponsor had not been pregnant and had not had a miscarriage, the explanation cited for the separation was not accepted. Moreover, a period apart of over 10 months is not a short period and it was not assessed by the Officer to be temporary.",
    "[41]\nThe respondent also submits that the FOSS notes, which were considered by the Officer and form part of the reasons for the decision, include information which reasonably led to the finding that the couple were not cohabiting, all of which was set out in the procedural fairness letter.",
    "[42]\nThe Officer reasonably concluded that the applicant was not cohabiting with his sponsor. At his interview, the applicant indicated that he was \"gone\" after January, 2011. His explanations for why he resided with his sister and brother-in-law were not accepted as credible given the evasive answers he provided at the time of the arrest and the inconsistency in his responses at the interview with those of his sponsor. The Officer did not accept that the sponsor had been pregnant and, therefore, the explanation for the time apart had no foundation and no other credible reason was offered. The sponsor had not taken steps to advise ODSP that she was married and ODSP records confirmed that she remained listed as single. The applicant had admitted at his interview following his arrest that he had said that he did not support her so that she could continue to be eligible for the ODSP benefits.\nThe pregnancy",
    "[43]\nThe applicant submits that there was no evidentiary basis for the Officer to doubt that the sponsor had been pregnant and had a miscarriage. The applicant submits that the hospital emergency visit due to abdominal pain supports the sponsor's condition. In addition, both the applicant and the sponsor responded to the Officer's questions about the pregnancy at the interview.",
    "[44]\nThe respondent submits that there was no medical evidence to corroborate the assertion that the sponsor was pregnant and had miscarried. The hospital record merely recounted that the sponsor had said she had a positive pregnancy test, followed by a negative test. The purpose of the hospital visit was not due to the miscarriage. In addition, the applicant and respondent provided inconsistent answers at the interview with respect to their intention to have children.",
    "[45]\nThe Officer's finding that the sponsor had not been pregnant is not unreasonable. Although the Officer does not specifically refer to the lack of reliable medical evidence that one would expect could be provided to establish that the sponsor had been pregnant or had miscarried, the Officer noted that he was not satisfied based on \"the documentation provided\". In addition, the sponsor and the applicant had very different responses regarding how long they had been attempting to conceive.\nOver reliance on the CBSA investigation",
    "[46]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer placed too much reliance on the CBSA investigation but did not provide any details or dates of surveillance to the applicant.",
    "[47]\nAs noted by the respondent, all the allegations arising from the CBSA investigation were set out in the procedural fairness letter and the applicant provided submissions in response, therefore, there was no breach of procedural fairness.",
    "[48]\nWith respect to the applicant's submission that the officer overly relied on the CBSA investigation, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence. The CBSA letter and the FOSS notes were considered by the Officer and the Officer was entitled to place more probative value on this evidence than on the evidence provided by the applicant.\nConclusion",
    "[49]\nThe Officer's decision that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he \"cohabits with (his) sponsor in Canada\" as required by Regulation 124(a) of the\nIRPR\nwas reasonable. While there was some conflicting evidence, the officer justified his conclusions, which were noted in the reasons, and were based on his assessment of all the evidence.",
    "[50]\nThe judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[51]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application is dismissed.\n2. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant, Syed Waqas Ali Gilani, seeks, under section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], the judicial review of the decision of March 16, 2012 by which an immigration officer [the officer] at the Canada Immigration Center in Etobicoke, Ontario, rejected the applicant's application for permanent residence as a member of the spouse or common-law partner class in Canada, because he had not satisfied paragraph 124\nhas\n) of\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [the Regulations] which requires the applicant to show that they are the spouse of a guarantor and that they live with that guarantor in Canada."

He married his sponsor, Rossana De Santis, a permanent resident of Canada, on May 24, 2006. In January, 2008, Mr Gilani's application for permanent residence was approved in principle.\n[4]\nLater in 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] received a tip, referred to as a \"poison pen letter\" which claimed that the applicant's marriage was one of convenience, and that the applicant was paying his sponsor as a part of the agreement. In 2011, the Canadian Border Services Agency [CBSA] conducted an investigation, either in response to the tip or as part of a broader probe, which led to the applicant's arrest in October, 2011.\n[5]\nAs a result of surveillance, CBSA found that the applicant was not residing with his spouse and sponsor, but rather with his sister and brother-in-law. CBSA also found that his cell phone bill was sent to his sister's address and his car was parked at this address and never at his sponsor's home address. CBSA also noted that his spouse and sponsor, a recipient of an Ontario Disability Support Pension [ODSP], had not advised ODSP that she was married, and still indicated her status as \"single\".\n[6]\nFollowing the applicant's release from detention following his arrest, he returned to his sponsor's residence. CIC sent a procedural fairness letter on October 12, 2011 setting out the allegations that the applicant was not cohabiting with his sponsor. The applicant provided submissions in reply and statutory declarations from relatives and friends who attested that the applicant and sponsor were married but had been apart for a period of time in 2011.\n[7]\nThe applicant and sponsor were interviewed by the Officer on March 15, 2012.\nThe Decision under Review\n[8]\nThe Officer determined that the applicant had satisfied the eligibility requirements to apply for permanent resident status in the spouse and common-law partner in Canada class, but failed to demonstrate that he \"cohabits with (his) sponsor in Canada\" as required by Regulation 124(a) of the\nIRPR\n.\n[9]\nThe Officer considered the evidence from CBSA and the applicant's submissions in response to the procedural fairness letter which explained that he spent some nights at his sister's home to help with her young family and because of its proximity to his work and also because he and his sponsor had some conflicts following her miscarriage in November 2010 which led him to leave in January, 2011, but that the time apart was not intended as a separation.\n[10]\nThe Officer referred to the statutory declarations from friends and family in support of the applicant's assertion that he and his sponsor were married and that their time apart was temporary and due to the miscarriage and other reasons, including the proximity of his sister's home to his work and his assistance to his sister and her young children, but attributed little weight to these declarations because they came from relatives and friends closely tied to the applicant and were self-serving.\n[11]\nThe Officer considered the explanations and information provided at the March 15, 2011 interview with the applicant and his sponsor, and found that the applicant lacked basic information about the sponsor's pregnancy and miscarriage, and that his answers were not consistent with his sponsor's answers.

However, the Officer concluded that it appeared that the applicant and his sponsor were not cohabiting from January, 2011, or earlier, until the time of his arrest.\nThe Issues\n[15]\nThe applicant submits that the decision should be quashed on four grounds. First, the Officer unreasonably gave low probative weight to relevant and corroborative evidence, namely the statutory declarations of family and friends. Second, the Officer made unreasonable findings of fact with respect to the couple's cohabitation, the pregnancy and the CBSA investigation. Third, the Officer made veiled findings about the genuineness of the marriage and conflated cohabitation with genuineness. Fourth, the Officer breached principles of procedural fairness by not disclosing the details of the poison pen letter.\n[16]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer's decision was reasonable based on his assessment of all the evidence and that the applicant is, in essence, asking the court to reweigh evidence, which is not the role of the Court.\nStandard of review\n[17]\nThe parties agree that in accordance with\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there are only two standards of review: correctness for questions of law and reasonableness involving questions of mixed fact and law. A finding of cohabitation is a factual determination and reviewed against a standard of reasonableness:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nSaid\n] at para 18.\n[18]\nThe relevant provision of the Regulations governing the spouse of common-law partner class is the following:\n124. A foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they\n(\na\n) are the spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;\n(\nb\n) have temporary resident status in Canada; and\n(\nc\n) are the subject of a sponsorship application.\n124. Fait partie de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada l'étranger qui remplit les conditions suivantes:\na) il est l'époux ou le conjoint de fait d'un répondant et vit avec ce répondant au Canada;\nb) il détient le statut de résident temporaire au Canada;\nc) une demande de parrainage a été déposée à son égard.\nDid the Officer breach principles of procedural fairness by not disclosing the poison pen letter?\n[19]\nThe Officer clearly stated that he gave the \"poison pen letter\" no weight. The Officer relied on the CBSA investigation, the results of which were disclosed to the applicant in the procedural fairness letter sent in October, 2011. In addition, the contents of the poison pen letter, even though no weight was given to it, were disclosed to the applicant and his sponsor at the interview and they had an opportunity to respond. As noted by Justice Mosley in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"poison pen letter\" need not be disclosed if the allegations are made known to the applicant.\n[13] Moreover, the applicant's contention that there was a breach of procedural fairness because the letter or its particulars were not disclosed to the applicant or her husband is without merit. It has been held that a \"poison pen letter\" does not necessarily have to be disclosed to an applicant so long as the applicant is made aware of the allegations contained therein:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 315 at para. 14. This is what occurred here. During the applicant's husband's interview, the visa officer explicitly indicated that they had received an anonymous letter and gave him the opportunity to respond to the visa officer's concerns: Visa Officer's Decision, Applicant's Record, pgs. 50-52. No breaches of natural justice can said to have been committed.\n[20]\nSimilarly, in this case there was no breach of procedural fairness.\nDid the Officer make veiled findings regarding the genuineness of the marriage?\n[21]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer conflated the requirements that a marriage be genuine with the cohabitation requirement and made veiled findings about the genuineness of the marriage. I do not agree. While the Officer referred to the CBSA report as suggesting that the \"couple is not cohabiting in a genuine marital relationship\", it is clear from the CBSA investigation and from the Officer's decision as a whole that he was focused on the cohabitation requirement. In addition, it is well settled that failure to meet any of the requirements of Regulation 124 is fatal. If there is no cohabitation with the spouse and sponsor, the applicant is not eligible.\n[22]\nAs noted by Justice Russell in\nSaid\nat para 34:\n34 ..... If there was no cohabitation then sponsorship was not possible. There was no reason to consider whether the marriage \"was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act\" as set out in section 4 of the Regulations. The issue for the Officer was not about why the marriage was entered into, but whether the Applicant and his Sponsor were cohabitating at the time of the application. I see no reasonable error on this point.\n[35] ..... Further, Justice Shore held in\nLaabou,\nabove, at paragraph 27, that the failure to meet any of the conditions in subsection 124(a) of the Regulations is fatal to the claim. Whether or not their marriage was genuine, the fact remains - as reasonably found by the Officer - that the Applicant and his Sponsor are not cohabiting. This is sufficient to exclude him from the Spouse in Canada class.\n[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 190, Justice Boivin referred to the criteria in Regulation 124 and noted, at para 11:\n[11] Failure to meet one of the above-mentioned conditions is fatal to the applicant's application for permanent residence. Essentially, the applicant is asking this Court to consider the concerns raised by the officer and the explanations provided by the applicant in reply and to reweigh those explanations and arrive at a different conclusion, which is not the role of this Court\n.\nDid the Officer reject corroborating evidence?\n[24]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer erred in rejecting the corroborating evidence which supported the applicant's claim that he and his sponsor had been married for six years and, although they had been apart for almost a year, this was not a permanent separation and was due to the conflict following the miscarriage. The applicant submits that the Officer erred in giving the statutory declarations of family low probative weight because they were self serving and from persons with close ties to the applicant, and that the Officer failed to consider the declarations from the friends. The applicant, relying on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], argues that evidence can not be rejected only because it is self serving. The applicant notes that those who submitted the declarations are the best placed to describe the relationship and the reasons for the applicant's time away from his sponsor.\n[25]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer was entitled to attribute low weight to the statutory declarations and that he did not do so solely on the basis that the declarations came from family and friends with close ties. The respondent submits that the Officer analysed the contents of the declarations, referred to this information in his decision, and weighed all this information against the evidence provided in the CBSA investigation.\n[26]\nAs noted by Justice de Montigny in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[26] However, jurisprudence has established that,\ndepending on the circumstances\n,\nevidence should not be disregarded simply because it emanates from individuals connected to the persons concerned\n:\nR v Laboucan,\n2010 SCC 12, at para 11. As counsel for the Respondent rightly notes,\nLaboucan\nconcerned a criminal matter; however, immigration jurisprudence from this Court has established the same principle. Indeed, several immigration cases hold that giving evidence little weight because it comes from a friend or relative is an error.\n[27] For example, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Dawson held at paragraph 25 that, \"solicitation does not per se invalidate the contents of the letter, nor does the fact that the letter was written by a relative.\" Likewise, Justice Phelan noted the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nThe Officer gives little weight to other witnesses' affidavit evidence because it comes from a close family friend and a cousin. The Officer fails to explain from whom such evidence should come other than friends and family.\nSimilarly, Justice Mactavish stated the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nWith respect to [\nsic\n] letter from the President of the organization, I do not understand the Board's criticism of the letter as being \"self-serving\", as it is likely that any evidence submitted by an applicant will be beneficial to his or her case, and could thus be characterized as 'self-serving'.\n[28] In light of this jurisprudence, and under the circumstances, I do not believe it was reasonable for the Officer to award this evidence low probative value simply because it came from the Applicants' family members. Presumably, the Officer would have preferred letters written by individuals who had no ties to the Applicants and who were not invested in the Applicants' well-being. However, it is not reasonable to expect that anyone unconnected to the Applicants would have been able to furnish this kind of evidence regarding what had happened to the Applicants in Mexico. The Applicants' family members were the individuals who observed their alleged persecution, so these family members are the people best-positioned to give evidence relating to those events. In addition, since the family members were themselves targeted after the Applicants' departure, it is appropriate that they offer first-hand descriptions of the events that they experienced.\nTherefore, it was unreasonable of the Officer to distrust this evidence simply because it came from individuals connected to the Applicants\n. (emphasis added)\n[27]\nOther cases have looked at the particular circumstances and reiterated that evidence should not be discounted\nsolely\nbecause it is self serving. An additional passage in\nAhmed\n, is relevant, where Justice Mactavish applied that principle:\n[32] That said, although there are problems with the Board's findings regarding the evidentiary value of the letter in assessing the nature of Mr. Ahmed's involvement with the Anjuman Hussainia, these findings were not patently unreasonable. The Board noted that the letter was written long after the alleged incidents took place, and made no reference to any of Mr. Ahmed's accomplishments or specific responsibilities within the Anjuman organization. Further, the Board's negative credibility finding regarding Mr. Ahmed's problems with the SSP did not hinge solely on this letter. The Board questioned several aspects of his claim, including the very existence of a tailor shop, and the extent of Mr. Ahmed's involvement in the rally. In these circumstances, it was not patently unreasonable for the Board to view this letter as being of little probative value.\n[28]\nSimilarly in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Teitelbaum stated that while it is an error to attribute little probative value on the basis that the documents are self serving, other basis may support the low probative value attributed.\n[29]\nThe two issues raised by the applicant with respect to the declarations are related: whether the Officer assigned low probative value only because of the source of the declarations or for other reasons after an analysis of their contents; and, whether the Officer was required to specifically mention each one.\n[30]\nThe Officer referred to the statutory declarations from family and friends and he indicated that he gave \"these documents\" little weight. There is nothing on the record to suggest that the Officer ignored some of the declarations.\n[31]\nThe applicant submits that although the Officer says he considered all the evidence, he ignored the supporting declarations from friends. The applicant relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Evans noted at para 17 that \"Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.\"\n[32]\nI would also note the words of Justice Near in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  with respect to the applicability of this principle:\n[16] The Applicant relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 264, for the proposition that the Board committed a reviewable error by not at least acknowledging evidence that contradicted its finding regarding the Applicant's credibility. Cepeda is a seminal case often cited on judicial review when the Board has come to a conclusion that differs from information contained in a piece of evidence submitted by the Applicant. In this particular context it is important to remember that the general principle to be distilled from Cepeda's evolution into an all-purpose documentary evidence citation is that the more probative the evidence, the more likely the Court will find error when the Board ignores it (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 394 at para 9).\n[33]\nIn this case, the Officer did not make any blanket statements about the statutory declarations. The Officer referred to the declarations from family and friends both generally and specifically. The Officer referred to the statutory declarations of the family members in consideration of the applicant's explanation for spending nights at his sister's home and the Officer referred to the brother-in-law's declaration regarding the address on the cell phone bill and to the sponsor's declaration regarding her single status for the purpose of the ODSP benefits.\n[34]\nWhile the Officer did not specifically refer to each of the statutory declarations from friends, he referred to his consideration of all the evidence before him. It must be recalled that the declarations were similar in content and the fact that the applicant and his sponsor had not been together since at least January, 2011 was not in dispute.\n[35]\nThe Officer acknowledged that the declarations sought to provide explanations for the applicant's time away from his sponsor, but based on the assessment of all the evidence, both in support and against, he gave the declarations low weight. As the respondent submits, the Officer was entitled to weigh all the evidence supporting the applicant with all the evidence provided by the CBSA investigation and the interviews and attribute low weight to the statutory declarations. The Court can not engage in a reweighing of the evidence.\n[36]\nI do not agree that the Officer overlooked or ignored any of the declarations or that he assigned low probative value only because the declarations were provided by his sister and brother-in-law and by neighbors.\n[37]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Reilly considered the reasonableness of an Officer's decision that found the applicant and his spousal sponsor were not cohabiting and found that while there was evidence supporting the claim that the couple lived together, there was also contrary evidence. The Officer's decision which canvassed all the evidence was not unreasonable as it fell within the range of acceptable outcomes, based on the facts and the law.\nDid the Officer make unreasonable findings of fact?\n[38]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer erred in making unreasonable findings of fact on three significant issues; the couple's cohabitation; the pregnancy; and, the results of the CBSA investigation.\nCohabitation\n[39]\nFirst the applicant argues that the Officer failed to consider the applicable Operations Manual, OP 2, which provides guidance to officers about the meaning of cohabitation and which notes that while cohabitation means living together continuously, some separations which are temporary and short are contemplated. The applicant submits that although he was staying at his sister's home after the miscarriage, he also spent time with his sponsor and her children and, as noted in their statutory declarations, their separation was temporary. The applicant further submits that the Officer failed to consider that the couple have lived together continuously since his release from detention following his arrest in October, 2011.\n[40]\nThe respondent agrees that OP 2 contemplates exceptions to cohabitation such as absences due to work or illness of a short and temporary nature, but not due to relationship problems. The Officer based his findings with respect to cohabitation on all the evidence. Given that the Officer found that the sponsor had not been pregnant and had not had a miscarriage, the explanation cited for the separation was not accepted. Moreover, a period apart of over 10 months is not a short period and it was not assessed by the Officer to be temporary.\n[41]\nThe respondent also submits that the FOSS notes, which were considered by the Officer and form part of the reasons for the decision, include information which reasonably led to the finding that the couple were not cohabiting, all of which was set out in the procedural fairness letter.\n[42]\nThe Officer reasonably concluded that the applicant was not cohabiting with his sponsor. At his interview, the applicant indicated that he was \"gone\" after January, 2011. His explanations for why he resided with his sister and brother-in-law were not accepted as credible given the evasive answers he provided at the time of the arrest and the inconsistency in his responses at the interview with those of his sponsor. The Officer did not accept that the sponsor had been pregnant and, therefore, the explanation for the time apart had no foundation and no other credible reason was offered. The sponsor had not taken steps to advise ODSP that she was married and ODSP records confirmed that she remained listed as single. The applicant had admitted at his interview following his arrest that he had said that he did not support her so that she could continue to be eligible for the ODSP benefits.\nThe pregnancy\n[43]\nThe applicant submits that there was no evidentiary basis for the Officer to doubt that the sponsor had been pregnant and had a miscarriage. The applicant submits that the hospital emergency visit due to abdominal pain supports the sponsor's condition. In addition, both the applicant and the sponsor responded to the Officer's questions about the pregnancy at the interview.\n[44]\nThe respondent submits that there was no medical evidence to corroborate the assertion that the sponsor was pregnant and had miscarried. The hospital record merely recounted that the sponsor had said she had a positive pregnancy test, followed by a negative test. The purpose of the hospital visit was not due to the miscarriage. In addition, the applicant and respondent provided inconsistent answers at the interview with respect to their intention to have children.\n[45]\nThe Officer's finding that the sponsor had not been pregnant is not unreasonable. Although the Officer does not specifically refer to the lack of reliable medical evidence that one would expect could be provided to establish that the sponsor had been pregnant or had miscarried, the Officer noted that he was not satisfied based on \"the documentation provided\". In addition, the sponsor and the applicant had very different responses regarding how long they had been attempting to conceive.\nOver reliance on the CBSA investigation\n[46]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer placed too much reliance on the CBSA investigation but did not provide any details or dates of surveillance to the applicant.\n[47]\nAs noted by the respondent, all the allegations arising from the CBSA investigation were set out in the procedural fairness letter and the applicant provided submissions in response, therefore, there was no breach of procedural fairness.\n[48]\nWith respect to the applicant's submission that the officer overly relied on the CBSA investigation, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence. The CBSA letter and the FOSS notes were considered by the Officer and the Officer was entitled to place more probative value on this evidence than on the evidence provided by the applicant.\nConclusion\n[49]\nThe Officer's decision that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he \"cohabits with (his) sponsor in Canada\" as required by Regulation 124(a) of the\nIRPR\nwas reasonable. While there was some conflicting evidence, the officer justified his conclusions, which were noted in the reasons, and were based on his assessment of all the evidence.\n[50]\nThe judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n[51]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application is dismissed.\n2. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur, Syed Waqas Ali Gilani, sollicite, en vertu de l'article 72 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], le contrôle judiciaire de la décision du 16 mars 2012 par laquelle un agent d'immigration [l'agent] au Centre d'Immigration Canada à Etobicoke (Ontario) a rejeté la demande de résidence permanente du demandeur à titre de membre de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada, parce qu'il n'avait pas satisfait à l'alinéa 124\na\n) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/2002-227 [le Règlement] qui exige que le demandeur montre qu'il est l'époux d'un répondant et qu'il habite avec ce répondant au Canada.\n[2]\nPour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est rejetée.\nLe contexte\n[3]\nMonsieur Gilani est un citoyen du Pakistan et il est arrivé au Canada en 2003. Le 24 mai 2006, il a épousé sa répondante, Rossana De Santis, une résidente permanente du Canada. En janvier 2008, la demande de résidence permanente de M. Gilani a été approuvée en principe.\n[4]\nPlus tard en 2008, Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada [CIC] a reçu un renseignement, dans ce qui est appelé une  lettre de dénonciation , alléguant que le mariage du demandeur était un mariage de convenance et qu'il payait sa répondante conformément à l'accord qu'il avait conclu avec elle. En 2011, l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada [l'ASFC] a effectué une enquête, soit en réponse au renseignement reçu ou dans le cadre d'une enquête plus large, qui a mené à l'arrestation du demandeur en octobre 2011.\n[5]\nAprès avoir soumis le demandeur à une surveillance, l'ASFC a conclu qu'il ne résidait pas avec son épouse et répondante, mais plutôt avec sa sur et son beau-frère. L'ASFC a également conclu que sa facture de téléphone cellulaire était envoyée à l'adresse de sa sur et que sa voiture était stationnée à cette adresse et qu'elle ne l'était jamais à l'adresse de la résidence de sa répondante. L'ASFC a également souligné que son épouse et répondante, prestataire du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicapées [POSPH], n'avait pas avisé le POSPH qu'elle était mariée et qu'elle indiquait qu'elle était toujours [traduction]  célibataire .\n[6]\nAprès avoir été libéré de détention à la suite de son arrestation, il est retourné à la résidence de sa répondante. Le 12 octobre 2011, CIC lui a transmis une lettre relative à l'équité procédurale l'informant des allégations selon lesquelles le demandeur ne vivait pas avec sa répondante. En réponse, le demandeur a fourni des observations ainsi que des déclarations prévues par la loi de la part de parents et amis qui ont attesté que le demandeur et sa répondante étaient mariés, mais qu'ils avaient été séparés pendant un certain temps au cours de 2011.\n[7]\nL'agent a eu une entrevue avec le demandeur et la répondante le 15 mars 2012.\nLa décision faisant l'objet du contrôle\n[8]\nL'agent a conclu que le demandeur avait répondu aux exigences en matière d'admissibilité pour demander la résidence permanente à titre de membre de la catégorie des époux et conjoints de fait au Canada, mais qu'il n'avait pas montré qu'il [traduction]  vit avec (sa) répondante au Canada , comme l'exige l'alinéa 124\na\n) du Règlement.\n[9]\nL'agent a tenu compte des éléments de preuve de l'ASFC et des observations du demandeur en réponse à la lettre relative à l'équité procédurale. Dans ses observations, le demandeur expliquait qu'il passait des nuits chez sa sur pour l'aider avec sa jeune famille et parce qu'elle habitait près du travail du demandeur. Selon le demandeur, il en était également ainsi en raison de certains conflits avec sa répondante à la suite de sa fausse couche en novembre 2010, ce qui a entraîné son départ en janvier 2011. Toujours selon le demandeur, la séparation n'était pas le but de la période pendant laquelle il n'était pas avec la répondante.\n[10]\nL'agent a mentionné les déclarations prévues par la loi provenant des amis et des membres de la famille à l'appui de l'affirmation du demandeur selon laquelle sa répondante et lui étaient mariés et que la période où ils n'étaient pas ensemble était temporaire. Cette période découlait de la fausse couche et d'autres raisons, notamment la proximité de la demeure de sa sur à son travail et l'aide qu'il apportait à sa sur et à ses jeunes enfants. L'agent n'a pas accordé de poids à ces déclarations parce qu'elles provenaient de parents qui avaient des liens étroits avec le demandeur et qu'elles étaient intéressées.\n[11]\nL'agent a tenu compte des explications et des renseignements fournis à l'entrevue du 15 mars 2011 avec le demandeur et sa répondante. Il a conclu que le demandeur ne connaissait pas les renseignements élémentaires concernant la grossesse de la répondante et sa fausse couche et que les réponses du demandeur ne correspondaient pas aux réponses de sa répondante. En ce qui a trait à la facture de téléphone cellulaire, l'agent a conclu que selon toute vraisemblance, celle-ci était envoyée à l'adresse de la sur et du beau frère du demandeur parce que le demandeur y vivait, non pas parce que le beau-frère du demandeur payait la facture. En ce qui concerne le fait que la répondante se désignait comme célibataire aux fins des prestations du POSPH, l'agent a conclu que même si la répondante avait indiqué qu'il s'agissait d'une erreur et qu'elle avait pris des mesures pour la corriger, aucun élément de preuve n'indiquait qu'elle avait agi en ce sens.\n[12]\nL'agent a également souligné que le demandeur avait fourni peu de réponses ou d'explications au moment de son arrestation et que ses réponses et explications au moment de l'entrevue étaient vraisemblablement inventées, car il avait eu le temps de se préparer.\n[13]\nL'agent a clairement déclaré qu'il n'accordait aucun poids à la  lettre de dénonciation , mais qu'il s'appuyait sur les résultats de l'enquête de l'ASFC et sur les observations que le demandeur a fournies en réponse, ainsi que sur l'entrevue.\n[14]\nL'agent a reconnu que le demandeur et sa répondante semblaient avoir habité ensemble après que le demandeur eut été libéré à la suite de sa détention en octobre 2011 et qu'il n'était pas nécessaire qu'un couple passe toutes les nuits ensemble dans la même résidence. L'agent a cependant conclu que le demandeur et sa répondante semblaient ne pas vivre ensemble depuis janvier 2011, ou plus tôt, jusqu'au moment de son arrestation.\nLes questions en litige\n[15]\nLe demandeur soutient que la décision devrait être annulée pour quatre motifs. Premièrement, l'agent a, de façon déraisonnable, accordé une faible valeur probante à des éléments de preuve pertinents et corroborants, à savoir les déclarations prévues par la loi émanant des membres de la famille et d'amis. Deuxièmement, l'agent a tiré des conclusions de fait déraisonnables en ce qui a trait à la cohabitation du couple, la grossesse et l'enquête de l'ASFC. Troisièmement, l'agent a tiré des conclusions voilées quant à l'authenticité du mariage et a confondu la cohabitation et l'authenticité. Quatrièmement, l'agent a manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale en ne divulguant pas les détails de la lettre de dénonciation.\n[16]\nLe défendeur soutient que la décision de l'agent était raisonnable compte tenu de son appréciation de tous les éléments de preuve. Il fait de plus valoir que le demandeur demande à la Cour de soupeser à nouveau la preuve, ce qui n'est pas son rôle.\nLa norme de contrôle\n[17]\nLes parties conviennent que suivant l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , il existe uniquement deux normes de contrôle: la norme de la décision correcte pour les questions de droit et la norme de la raisonnabilité pour les questions mixtes de fait et de droit. Une conclusion de cohabitation est une conclusion de fait qui doit être revue selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSaid\n]).\n[18]\nLa disposition pertinente du Règlement régissant la catégorie des époux et conjoints de fait est la suivante:\n124. Fait partie de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada l'étranger qui remplit les conditions suivantes:\na) il est l'époux ou le conjoint de fait d'un répondant et vit avec ce répondant au Canada;\nb) il détient le statut de résident temporaire au Canada;\nc) une demande de parrainage a été déposée à son égard.\n124. A foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they\n(\na\n) are the spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;\n(\nb\n) have temporary resident status in Canada; and\n(\nc\n) are the subject of a sponsorship application.\nL'agent a-t-il manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale en ne communiquant pas la lettre de dénonciation?\n[19]\nL'agent a clairement déclaré qu'il n'accordait aucun poids à la  lettre de dénonciation . Il s'est appuyé sur l'enquête de l'ASFC, dont les résultats ont été communiqués au demandeur dans la lettre relative à l'équité procédurale envoyée en octobre 2011. En outre, le contenu de la lettre de dénonciation, même si aucun poids n'y a été accordé, a été communiqué au demandeur et à sa répondante lors de l'entrevue et ces derniers ont eu la possibilité d'y répondre. Comme l'a souligné le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> il n'est pas nécessaire de communiquer une  lettre de dénonciation  si l'on porte les allégations à la connaissance du demandeur:\n[13] De plus, la prétention de la demanderesse voulant que l'omission de lui communiquer, ou de communiquer à son époux, la lettre ou les détails de celle-ci constituait un manquement à l'équité procédurale est sans fondement. Il a été conclu qu'une  lettre malicieuse anonyme  n'a pas nécessairement à être communiquée à un demandeur, tant et aussi longtemps qu'on porte à sa connaissance les allégations contenues dans la lettre:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 315, au paragraphe 14. C'est ce qui s'est produit en l'espèce. Au cours de l'entrevue de l'époux de la demanderesse, l'agente des visas a explicitement mentionné que Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada avait reçu une lettre anonyme et lui a donné la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations: voir la décision de l'agente des visas, dossier de la demande, pages 50-52. L'on ne peut affirmer qu'il y a eu des manquements à la justice naturelle.\n[20]\nEn l'espèce, il n'y a pas non plus eu de manquement à l'équité procédurale.\nL'agent a-t-il tiré des conclusions voilées concernant l'authenticité du mariage?\n[21]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agent a assimilé les exigences relatives à l'authenticité d'un mariage et l'exigence de cohabitation et qu'il a tiré des conclusions voilées concernant l'authenticité du mariage. Je ne suis pas d'accord. Même si l'agent a mentionné que le rapport de l'ASFC indiquait que le [traduction]  couple ne vit pas ensemble dans le cadre d'une relation conjugale authentique , il ressort clairement de l'enquête de l'ASFC et de la décision de l'agent dans son ensemble qu'il a mis l'accent sur l'exigence de la cohabitation. De plus, il est bien établi que le non-respect de l'une des exigences de l'article 124 du Règlement entraîne le rejet de la demande. Si l'époux et la répondante ne vivent pas ensemble, le demandeur n'est pas admissible.\n[22]\nVoici ce qu'a déclaré le juge Russell au paragraphe 34 de\nSaid\n:\n34 [...] S'il n'y avait pas cohabitation, alors le parrainage n'était pas possible. Elle n'avait aucune raison de se demander si le mariage était ou non authentique et s'il visait ou non principalement l'acquisition d'un statut ou d'un privilège sous le régime de la Loi, selon ce que prévoit l'article 4 du Règlement. L'agente n'avait pas à se demander pourquoi le mariage avait été contracté, mais plutôt si le demandeur et sa répondante vivaient ensemble à la date de la demande. Je ne vois aucune erreur de l'agente sur cet aspect.\n[35] [...] Par ailleurs, le juge Shore écrivait, dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> que le fait de ne pas remplir l'une des conditions de l'alinéa 124\na\n) du Règlement rend irrecevable la demande de résidence permanente. Que leur mariage soit ou non authentique, il reste que, comme l'a conclu avec raison l'agente, le demandeur et sa répondante ne vivaient pas ensemble. Cela suffit à exclure le demandeur de la catégorie des époux au Canada.\n[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 216, le juge Boivin a mentionné les critères prévus à l'article 124 du Règlement et a souligné ce qui suit au paragraphe 11:\n[11] Le non-respect par le demandeur d'une des conditions d'obtention de la résidence permanente est fatal à sa demande. Essentiellement, la demanderesse demande à la Cour de tenir compte des questions soulevées par l'agent et des explications qu'elle a fournies en réponse puis de réévaluer ces explications afin d'en arriver à une conclusion différente, ce qui n'est pas le rôle de la Cour.\nL'agent a-t-il rejeté des éléments de preuve corroborants?\n[24]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agent a commis une erreur en rejetant des éléments de preuve corroborants qui appuyaient sa prétention selon laquelle sa répondante et lui étaient mariés depuis six ans et que même s'ils avaient été séparés pendant presque un an, il ne s'agissait pas d'une séparation permanente et que la situation découlait du conflit à la suite de sa fausse couche. Le demandeur fait valoir que l'agent a commis une erreur en accordant aux déclarations prévues par la loi émanant des membres de la famille une faible valeur probante parce que les déclarations étaient intéressées et qu'elles provenaient de personnes qui avaient des liens étroits avec le demandeur. Le demandeur prétend de plus que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte des déclarations provenant des amis.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], le demandeur soutient que des éléments de preuve ne peuvent être rejetés uniquement parce qu'ils sont intéressés. Le demandeur souligne que ceux qui ont présenté les déclarations sont les mieux placés pour décrire la relation et les raisons pour lesquelles le demandeur a vécu séparé de sa répondante.\n[25]\nLe défendeur soutient que l'agent avait le droit d'accorder une faible valeur aux déclarations prévues par la loi et qu'il ne l'a pas fait uniquement au motif que les déclarations provenaient de membres de la famille et d'amis qui entretenaient des liens étroits avec le demandeur. Le défendeur fait valoir que l'agent a analysé le contenu des déclarations, a mentionné ces renseignements dans sa décision et a soupesé ces renseignements avec les éléments de preuve qu'a fournis l'enquête de l'ASFC.\n[26]\nVoici ce qu'a déclaré le juge de Montigny dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[26] Toutefois, la jurisprudence a établi que, selon les circonstances,\nla preuve ne doit pas être écartée simplement parce qu'elle provient de personnes liées aux intéressés\n:\nR c. Laboucan\n, 2010 CSC 12, au par. 11. Comme le souligne avec raison l'avocate du défendeur, l'arrêt\nLaboucan\na été rendu dans une affaire criminelle; cependant, la jurisprudence de la Cour en matière d'immigration a établi le même principe. En effet, selon plusieurs décisions en matière d'immigration, le fait d'accorder peu de poids à la preuve parce qu'elle émane d'un ami ou d'un membre de la famille constitue une erreur.\n[27] Par exemple, dans l'affaire\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Dawson a statué, au paragraphe 25, que  le fait qu'une lettre a été sollicitée ou qu'elle a été écrite par un parent n'est pas suffisant en soi pour en invalider le contenu . De même, le juge Phelan a fait observer ce qui suit dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nL'agente n'attache guère de valeur probante au témoignage par affidavit des deux autres témoins parce qu'il émane d'un ami intime de la famille et d'un cousin. Elle n'explique pas qui d'autre que des amis et des parents devrait donner ce genre de témoignage.\nDe même, dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> la juge Mactavish a déclaré ce qui suit:\nS'agissant de la lettre du président de l'organisation, je ne comprends pas la critique de la Commission lorsqu'elle dit que la lettre était intéressée, puisqu'il est probable que tout élément de preuve présenté par un revendicateur sera utile pour son cas et pourrait par conséquent être qualifié d' intéressé .\n[28] À la lumière de cette jurisprudence, dans les circonstances, je ne crois pas qu'il était raisonnable que l'agente accorde à cette preuve une faible valeur probante simplement parce qu'elle émanait des membres de la famille des demandeurs. L'agente aurait sans doute préféré des lettres écrites par des personnes n'ayant aucun lien avec les demandeurs et ne se souciant pas de leur bien-être. Cependant, il n'est pas raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'une personne n'ayant aucun lien avec les demandeurs soit en mesure de fournir ce genre de preuve à propos de ce qui est arrivé aux demandeurs au Mexique. Les membres de la famille des demandeurs ont été témoins de leur persécution alléguée, alors ce sont les personnes les mieux placées pour témoigner au sujet de ces événements. De plus, comme les membres de leur famille ont eux-mêmes été ciblés après le départ des demandeurs, il est opportun qu'ils décrivent eux-mêmes les événements qu'ils ont vécus.\nPar conséquent, il était déraisonnable que l'agente n'ajoute pas foi à cette preuve simplement parce qu'elle émanait de personnes liées aux demandeurs\n.\n(Non souligné dans l'original.)\n[27]\nLa Cour a examiné d'autres décisions dans les circonstances particulières et réitéré que des éléments de preuve ne devraient pas être écartés\nuniquement\nparce qu'ils sont intéressés. Dans un autre passage pertinent dans\nAhmed\n, la juge Mactavish applique ce principe:\n[32] Cela dit, malgré les failles que montrent les conclusions de la Commission sur la valeur probante de la lettre en ce qui a trait à la nature du rôle de M. Ahmed au sein du Anjuman Hussainia, ces conclusions n'étaient pas manifestement déraisonnables. La Commission a relevé que la lettre avait été écrite longtemps après les présumés incidents, et qu'elle ne faisait état d'aucune des réalisations ou des responsabilités de M. Ahmed au sein de l'organisation Anjuman. Par ailleurs, les doutes de la Commission à propos des ennuis que connaissait M. Ahmed avec le SSP ne reposaient pas uniquement sur cette lettre. La Commission mettait en doute plusieurs aspects de sa revendication, notamment l'existence même d'un atelier de confection, et le niveau de la participation de M. Ahmed à la manifestation. Il n'était donc pas manifestement déraisonnable pour la Commission de ne pas accorder beaucoup de crédit à cette lettre.\n[28]\nDe même, dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> le juge Teitelbaum a déclaré que le fait d'accorder peu de valeur probante à des documents parce qu'ils sont intéressés constitue une erreur, mais que l'attribution d'une faible valeur probante pouvait reposer sur d'autres fondements.\n[29]\nLes deux questions que soulève le demandeur concernant les déclarations sont liées: celle de savoir si l'agent a accordé une faible valeur probante uniquement en raison de la source des déclarations ou pour d'autres motifs après en avoir analysé le contenu et celle de savoir si l'agent était tenu de mentionner chaque déclaration.\n[30]\nL'agent a mentionné les déclarations prévues par la loi émanant de parents et amis et il a indiqué qu'il accordait peu de poids à [traduction]  ces documents . Rien dans le dossier n'indique que l'agent a ignoré certaines déclarations.\n[31]\nLe demandeur soutient que même si l'agent dit qu'il a examiné tous les éléments de preuve, il a ignoré les déclarations à l'appui émanant des amis. Le demandeur invoque\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où le juge Evans a souligné ceci, au paragraphe 17:  Ainsi, une déclaration générale affirmant que l'organisme a examiné l'ensemble de la preuve ne suffit pas lorsque les éléments de preuve dont elle n'a pas discuté dans ses motifs semblent carrément contredire sa conclusion. Qui plus est, quand l'organisme fait référence de façon assez détaillée à des éléments de preuve appuyant sa conclusion, mais qu'elle passe sous silence des éléments de preuve qui tendent à prouver le contraire, il peut être plus facile d'inférer que l'organisme n'a pas examiné la preuve contradictoire pour en arriver à sa conclusion de fait. \n[32]\nJ'aimerais également citer les propos tenus par le juge  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  concernant l'applicabilité de ce principe:\n[16] Le demandeur cite la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 264, pour appuyer la proposition selon laquelle la Commission a commis une erreur susceptible de révision en ne reconnaissant pas au moins que l'existence de certains éléments de preuve contredisent la conclusion qu'elle a tirée au sujet de sa crédibilité. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est une décision clé souvent citée dans le cadre d'un contrôle judiciaire lorsque la Commission a tiré une conclusion qui diffère de l'information contenue dans un élément de preuve produit par le demandeur. Dans ce contexte particulier, il est important de se rappeler que le principe général qui se dégage de l'évolution de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , qui est devenue une référence d'application générale en matière de preuve documentaire, est que plus la valeur probante d'une preuve est importante, plus la Cour sera susceptible de conclure que la Commission a commis une erreur en ne tenant pas compte de cette preuve (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 394, par. 9).\n[33]\nEn l'espèce, l'agent n'a pas fait de déclaration générale à propos des déclarations prévues par la loi. Il a mentionné les déclarations émanant des parents et amis à la fois de façon générale et de façon précise. L'agent a mentionné les déclarations prévues par la loi provenant des membres de la famille relativement à l'explication du demandeur à propos du fait qu'il passait les nuits à la résidence de sa sur. Il a également mentionné la déclaration émanant du beau-frère concernant l'adresse sur la facture de téléphone cellulaire du beau-frère et la déclaration de la répondante concernant le fait qu'elle se désignait comme célibataire aux fins des prestations du POSPH.\n[34]\nBien que l'agent n'ait pas mentionné de façon précise chacune des déclarations prévues par la loi émanant des amis, il a mentionné qu'il avait pris en compte tous les éléments de preuve qui lui avaient été présentés. Il faut rappeler que le contenu des déclarations était semblable et que le fait que le demandeur et sa répondante n'étaient pas ensemble depuis au moins janvier 2011 n'était pas contesté.\n[35]\nL'agent a reconnu que les déclarations avaient pour but de fournir des explications concernant la période pendant laquelle le demandeur n'était pas avec sa répondante, mais compte tenu de son appréciation de tous les éléments de preuve, à la fois pour et contre, il a accordé peu de poids aux déclarations. Comme le défendeur le soutient, l'agent avait le droit de soupeser tous les éléments de preuve appuyant la demande et tous les éléments de preuve qu'avait fournis l'enquête de l'ASFC et les entrevues et d'accorder peu de poids aux déclarations prévues par la loi. La Cour ne peut pas soupeser à nouveau la preuve.\n[36]\nJe ne suis pas d'accord pour dire que l'agent a ignoré ou écarté des déclarations ou leur a attribué une faible valeur probante uniquement parce que les déclarations émanaient de la sur du demandeur et de son beau-frère ainsi que de voisins.\n[37]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge O'Reilly a examiné le caractère raisonnable de la décision d'une agente, laquelle avait conclu que le demandeur et sa conjointe répondante ne vivaient pas ensemble et avait conclu que même si des éléments de preuve appuyaient la prétention selon laquelle le couple vivait ensemble, il y avait des éléments de preuve contraire. La décision de l'agente qui examinait tous les éléments de preuve n'était pas déraisonnable, car elle appartenait aux issues possibles acceptables au regard des faits et du droit.\nL'agent a-t-il tiré des conclusions de fait déraisonnables?\n[38]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agent a commis une erreur en tirant des conclusions de fait déraisonnables à l'égard de trois questions importantes: la cohabitation du couple, la grossesse et les résultats de l'enquête de l'ASFC.\nLa cohabitation\n[39]\nPremièrement, le demandeur soutient que l'agent n'a pas tenu compte du Guide opérationnel OP 2 qui s'applique et fournit des indications aux agents à propos de la signification du mot  cohabitation . Le Guide OP 2 souligne que bien que la cohabitation signifie vivre ensemble de façon continue, certaines séparations temporaires et de courte durée sont envisagées. Le demandeur fait valoir que même s'il demeurait chez sa sur après la fausse couche, il passait également du temps avec sa répondante et les enfants de celle-ci. De plus, comme l'indiquent les déclarations statutaires, la séparation était temporaire. Le demandeur prétend en outre que l'agent a omis de prendre en compte le fait que le couple avait vécu ensemble de façon continue après qu'il a été libéré de sa détention à la suite de son arrestation en octobre 2011.\n[40]\nLe défendeur convient que le Guide opérationnel OP 2 prévoit des exceptions à la cohabitation, telles que les absences temporaires et de courte durée en raison du travail et de la maladie, mais non en raison de problèmes relationnels. L'agent a fondé ses conclusions quant à la cohabitation sur tous les éléments de preuve. Étant donné que l'agent a conclu que la répondante n'avait pas été enceinte et qu'elle n'avait pas eu de fausse couche, l'explication présentée concernant la séparation n'a pas été acceptée. De plus, une séparation de plus de dix mois n'est pas une séparation de courte durée et selon l'évaluation de l'agent, elle n'était pas temporaire.\n[41]\nLe défendeur fait également valoir que les notes du SSOBL, dont l'agent a tenu compte et qui font partie des motifs de la décision, comprennent des renseignements qui ont raisonnablement mené à la conclusion selon laquelle le couple ne vivait pas ensemble et qui étaient tous présentés dans la lettre relative à l'équité procédurale.\n[42]\nL'agent a conclu de façon raisonnable que le demandeur ne vivait pas avec sa répondante. Lors de son entrevue, le demandeur a indiqué qu'il était [traduction]  parti  après janvier 2011. Ces explications concernant les raisons pour lesquelles il résidait chez sa sur et son beau-frère n'ont pas été reconnues comme étant crédibles, compte tenu des réponses évasives qu'il avait fournies au moment de son arrestation et du fait qu'il a fourni des réponses qui ne correspondaient pas à celles de sa répondante au moment de l'entrevue. L'agent n'a pas reconnu que la répondante avait été enceinte et, par conséquent, l'explication concernant la période pendant laquelle le demandeur et la répondante ont été séparés était sans fondement et aucune autre raison crédible n'a été présentée. La répondante n'avait pas pris de mesures pour informer le POSPH qu'elle était mariée et les dossiers du POSPH ont confirmé qu'elle continuait d'être désignée comme célibataire. Lors de l'entrevue suivant son arrestation, le demandeur avait avoué qu'il avait dit ne pas subvenir à ses besoins pour qu'elle puisse continuer à être admissible aux prestations du POSPH.\nLa grossesse\n[43]\nLe demandeur soutient qu'aucun élément de preuve ne permettait à l'agent de mettre en doute la grossesse et la fausse couche de la répondante. Il fait valoir que la visite aux urgences de l'hôpital en raison de douleurs abdominales étaye l'état de la répondante. De plus, lors de l'entrevue, le demandeur et la répondante ont tous deux répondu aux questions de l'agent concernant la grossesse.\n[44]\nLe défendeur soutient qu'il n'y avait aucun élément de preuve médicale pour corroborer l'affirmation selon laquelle la répondante avait été enceinte et qu'elle avait fait une fausse couche. Le dossier médical relatait simplement que la répondante avait indiqué qu'un test de grossesse avait fourni un résultat positif, suivi d'un résultat négatif. La fausse couche n'était pas l'objet de la visite à l'hôpital. En outre, le demandeur et la répondante ont, à l'entrevue, fourni des réponses contradictoires quant à leur intention d'avoir des enfants.\n[45]\nLa conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle la répondante n'avait pas été enceinte n'est pas déraisonnable. Bien que l'agent ne mentionne pas précisément l'absence de preuve médicale fiable à laquelle on pourrait s'attendre pour établir la grossesse ou la fausse couche de la répondante, l'agent a souligné qu'il n'était pas convaincu compte tenu, des [traduction]  documents fournis . En outre, la répondante et le demandeur ont donné des réponses très différentes concernant la période depuis laquelle ils tentaient de concevoir un enfant.\nTrop grande importance accordée à l'enquête de l'ASFC\n[46]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agent a accordé une trop grande importance à l'enquête de l'ASFC et n'a pas fourni de détails ou de dates concernant la surveillance dont il avait fait l'objet.\n[47]\nComme l'a souligné le défendeur, toutes les allégations découlant de l'enquête de l'ASFC étaient énoncées dans la lettre relative à l'équité procédurale et le demandeur a fourni des observations en réponse à celle-ci. Par conséquent, il n'y a eu aucun manquement à l'équité procédurale.\n[48]\nEn ce qui concerne l'observation du demandeur selon laquelle l'agent a accordé une trop grande importance à l'enquête de l'ASFC, il n'appartient pas à la Cour de soupeser la preuve de nouveau. L'agent a tenu compte de la lettre de l'ASFC et des notes du SSOBL et il lui était loisible d'accorder une plus grande valeur probante à ces éléments de preuve qu'aux éléments de preuve fournis par le demandeur.\nConclusion\n[49]\nLa décision de l'agent, selon laquelle le demandeur n'a pas montré qu'il  vit avec (son) répondant au Canada  comme l'exige l'alinéa 124\na\n) du Règlement, était raisonnable. Malgré certains éléments de preuve contradictoires, l'agent a justifié ses conclusions, qui étaient mentionnées dans les motifs et fondées sur son appréciation de tous les éléments de preuve.\n[50]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\nJUGEMENT\n[51]\nLA COUR ORDONNE\n:\n1. La requête est rejetée.\n2. Il n'y a aucune question aux fins de certification.\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 243)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nKane, J.\nMarch 7, 2013.\nCounsel:\nTara McElroy, for the applicant;\nMelissa Mathieu, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nWaldman & Associates, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;\nWilliam F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nKane, J.\n: The applicant, Mr Syed Waqas Ali Gilani, seeks judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\nSC 2001, c 27 [\nIRPA\n] of a decision made by an Immigration Officer [the Officer] at the Canada Immigration Centre, Etobicoke, Ontario, dated March 16, 2012, refusing his claim for permanent residence as a member of the Spouse or Common-law partner in Canada class, because he had not satisfied Regulation 124(a) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [\nIRPR\n] which requires an applicant to demonstrate that the applicant is the spouse of a sponsor and that the applicant cohabits with the sponsor in Canada.\n\n[2]\nFor the reasons that follow the application is dismissed.\nBackground\n\n[3]\nMr Gilani is a citizen of Pakistan who arrived in Canada in 2003. He married his sponsor, Rossana De Santis, a permanent resident of Canada, on May 24, 2006. In January, 2008, Mr Gilani's application for permanent residence was approved in principle.\n\n[4]\nLater in 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada [CIC] received a tip, referred to as a \"poison pen letter\" which claimed that the applicant's marriage was one of convenience, and that the applicant was paying his sponsor as a part of the agreement. In 2011, the Canadian Border Services Agency [CBSA] conducted an investigation, either in response to the tip or as part of a broader probe, which led to the applicant's arrest in October, 2011.\n\n[5]\nAs a result of surveillance, CBSA found that the applicant was not residing with his spouse and sponsor, but rather with his sister and brother-in-law. CBSA also found that his cell phone bill was sent to his sister's address and his car was parked at this address and never at his sponsor's home address. CBSA also noted that his spouse and sponsor, a recipient of an Ontario Disability Support Pension [ODSP], had not advised ODSP that she was married, and still indicated her status as \"single\".\n\n[6]\nFollowing the applicant's release from detention following his arrest, he returned to his sponsor's residence. CIC sent a procedural fairness letter on October 12, 2011 setting out the allegations that the applicant was not cohabiting with his sponsor. The applicant provided submissions in reply and statutory declarations from relatives and friends who attested that the applicant and sponsor were married but had been apart for a period of time in 2011.\n\n[7]\nThe applicant and sponsor were interviewed by the Officer on March 15, 2012.\nThe Decision under Review\n\n[8]\nThe Officer determined that the applicant had satisfied the eligibility requirements to apply for permanent resident status in the spouse and common-law partner in Canada class, but failed to demonstrate that he \"cohabits with (his) sponsor in Canada\" as required by Regulation 124(a) of the\nIRPR\n.\n\n[9]\nThe Officer considered the evidence from CBSA and the applicant's submissions in response to the procedural fairness letter which explained that he spent some nights at his sister's home to help with her young family and because of its proximity to his work and also because he and his sponsor had some conflicts following her miscarriage in November 2010 which led him to leave in January, 2011, but that the time apart was not intended as a separation.\n\n[10]\nThe Officer referred to the statutory declarations from friends and family in support of the applicant's assertion that he and his sponsor were married and that their time apart was temporary and due to the miscarriage and other reasons, including the proximity of his sister's home to his work and his assistance to his sister and her young children, but attributed little weight to these declarations because they came from relatives and friends closely tied to the applicant and were self-serving.\n\n[11]\nThe Officer considered the explanations and information provided at the March 15, 2011 interview with the applicant and his sponsor, and found that the applicant lacked basic information about the sponsor's pregnancy and miscarriage, and that his answers were not consistent with his sponsor's answers. With respect to the cell phone bill, the Officer concluded that it was more likely that it was sent to his sister and brother-in-law's address because the applicant lived there, rather than because the applicant's brother-in-law was paying the bill. With respect to the sponsor's status as single for the purpose of her ODSP benefits, the Officer found that while the sponsor indicated that this was a mistake which she had taken steps to clarify, there was no evidence that she had done so.\n\n[12]\nThe Officer also noted that the applicant had few answers or explanations at the time of his arrest and his answers and explanations at the time of the interview were likely made up and the result of having time to prepare.\n\n[13]\nThe Officer clearly stated that he gave no weight to the \"poison pen letter\", but relied on the results of the CBSA investigation and the submissions of the applicant in response, including the interview.\n\n[14]\nThe Officer acknowledged that the applicant and his sponsor appeared to have resided together after his release from detention in October, 2011 and that a couple need not spend every night together in the same home. However, the Officer concluded that it appeared that the applicant and his sponsor were not cohabiting from January, 2011, or earlier, until the time of his arrest.\nThe Issues\n\n[15]\nThe applicant submits that the decision should be quashed on four grounds. First, the Officer unreasonably gave low probative weight to relevant and corroborative evidence, namely the statutory declarations of family and friends. Second, the Officer made unreasonable findings of fact with respect to the couple's cohabitation, the pregnancy and the CBSA investigation. Third, the Officer made veiled findings about the genuineness of the marriage and conflated cohabitation with genuineness. Fourth, the Officer breached principles of procedural fairness by not disclosing the details of the poison pen letter.\n\n[16]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer's decision was reasonable based on his assessment of all the evidence and that the applicant is, in essence, asking the court to reweigh evidence, which is not the role of the Court.\nStandard of review\n\n[17]\nThe parties agree that in accordance with\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , there are only two standards of review: correctness for questions of law and reasonableness involving questions of mixed fact and law. A finding of cohabitation is a factual determination and reviewed against a standard of reasonableness:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nSaid\n] at para 18.\n\n[18]\nThe relevant provision of the Regulations governing the spouse of common-law partner class is the following:\n124. A foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they\n(\nhas\n) are the spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;\n(\nb\n) have temporary resident status in Canada; and\n(\nc\n) are the subject of a sponsorship application.\n124. A foreigner who meets the following conditions is part of the category of spouse or common-law partner in Canada:\n(a) he is the spouse or common-law partner of a guarantor and lives with that guarantor in Canada;\n(b) he holds temporary resident status in Canada;\nc) a sponsorship application has been filed in his regard.\nDid the Officer breach principles of procedural fairness by not disclosing the poison pen letter?\n\n[19]\nThe Officer clearly stated that he gave the \"poison pen letter\" no weight. The Officer relied on the CBSA investigation, the results of which were disclosed to the applicant in the procedural fairness letter sent in October, 2011. In addition, the contents of the poison pen letter, even though no weight was given to it, were disclosed to the applicant and his sponsor at the interview and they had an opportunity to respond. As noted by Justice Mosley in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"poison pen letter\" need not be disclosed if the allegations are made known to the applicant. [13] Moreover, the applicant's contention that there was a breach of procedural fairness because the letter or its particulars were not disclosed to the applicant or her husband is without merit. It has been held that a \"poison pen letter\" does not necessarily have to be disclosed to an applicant so long as the applicant is made aware of the allegations contained therein:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 315 at para. 14. This is what occurred here. During the applicant's husband's interview, the visa officer explicitly indicated that they had received an anonymous letter and gave him the opportunity to respond to the visa officer's concerns: Visa Officer's Decision, Applicant's Record, pgs. 50-52. No breaches of natural justice can said to have been committed.\n\n[20]\nSimilarly, in this case there was no breach of procedural fairness.\nDid the Officer make veiled findings regarding the genuineness of the marriage?\n\n[21]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer conflated the requirements that a marriage be genuine with the cohabitation requirement and made veiled findings about the genuineness of the marriage. I do not agree. While the Officer referred to the CBSA report as suggesting that the \"couple is not cohabiting in a genuine marital relationship\", it is clear from the CBSA investigation and from the Officer's decision as a whole that he was focused on the cohabitation requirement. In addition, it is well settled that failure to meet any of the requirements of Regulation 124 is fatal. If there is no cohabitation with the spouse and sponsor, the applicant is not eligible.\n\n[22]\nAs noted by Justice Russell in\nSaid\nat para 34:\n34 ..... If there was no cohabitation then sponsorship was not possible. There was no reason to consider whether the marriage \"was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act\" as set out in section 4 of the Regulations. The issue for the Officer was not about why the marriage was entered into, but whether the Applicant and his Sponsor were cohabitating at the time of the application. I see no reasonable error on this point. [35] ..... Further, Justice Shore held in\nLaabou,\nabove, at paragraph 27, that the failure to meet any of the conditions in subsection 124(a) of the Regulations is fatal to the claim. Whether or not their marriage was genuine, the fact remains - as reasonably found by the Officer - that the Applicant and his Sponsor are not cohabiting. This is sufficient to exclude him from the Spouse in Canada class.\n\n[23]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 190, Justice Boivin referred to the criteria in Regulation 124 and noted, at para 11: [11] Failure to meet one of the above-mentioned conditions is fatal to the applicant's application for permanent residence. Essentially, the applicant is asking this Court to consider the concerns raised by the officer and the explanations provided by the applicant in reply and to reweigh those explanations and arrive at a different conclusion, which is not the role of this Court\n.\nDid the Officer reject corroborating evidence?\n\n[24]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer erred in rejecting the corroborating evidence which supported the applicant's claim that he and his sponsor had been married for six years and, although they had been apart for almost a year, this was not a permanent separation and was due to the conflict following the miscarriage. The applicant submits that the Officer erred in giving the statutory declarations of family low probative weight because they were self serving and from persons with close ties to the applicant, and that the Officer failed to consider the declarations from the friends. The applicant, relying on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], argues that evidence can not be rejected only because it is self serving. The applicant notes that those who submitted the declarations are the best placed to describe the relationship and the reasons for the applicant's time away from his sponsor.\n\n[25]\nThe respondent submits that the Officer was entitled to attribute low weight to the statutory declarations and that he did not do so solely on the basis that the declarations came from family and friends with close ties. The respondent submits that the Officer analysed the contents of the declarations, referred to this information in his decision, and weighed all this information against the evidence provided in the CBSA investigation.\n\n[26]\nAs noted by Justice de Montigny in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [26] However, jurisprudence has established that,\ndepending on the circumstances\n,\nevidence should not be disregarded simply because it emanates from individuals connected to the persons concerned\n:\nR v Laboucan,\n2010 SCC 12, at para 11. As counsel for the Respondent rightly notes,\nLaboucan\nconcerned a criminal matter; however, immigration jurisprudence from this Court has established the same principle. Indeed, several immigration cases hold that giving evidence little weight because it comes from a friend or relative is an error.\n\n[27] For example, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Dawson held at paragraph 25 that, \"solicitation does not per se invalidate the contents of the letter, nor does the fact that the letter was written by a relative.\" Likewise, Justice Phelan noted the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nThe Officer gives little weight to other witnesses' affidavit evidence because it comes from a close family friend and a cousin. The Officer fails to explain from whom such evidence should come other than friends and family.\nSimilarly, Justice Mactavish stated the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nWith respect to [\nsic\n] letter from the President of the organization, I do not understand the Board's criticism of the letter as being \"self-serving\", as it is likely that any evidence submitted by an applicant will be beneficial to his or her case, and could thus be characterized as 'self-serving'.\n\n[28] In light of this jurisprudence, and under the circumstances, I do not believe it was reasonable for the Officer to award this evidence low probative value simply because it came from the Applicants' family members. Presumably, the Officer would have preferred letters written by individuals who had no ties to the Applicants and who were not invested in the Applicants' well-being. However, it is not reasonable to expect that anyone unconnected to the Applicants would have been able to furnish this kind of evidence regarding what had happened to the Applicants in Mexico. The Applicants' family members were the individuals who observed their alleged persecution, so these family members are the people best-positioned to give evidence relating to those events. In addition, since the family members were themselves targeted after the Applicants' departure, it is appropriate that they offer first-hand descriptions of the events that they experienced.\nTherefore, it was unreasonable of the Officer to distrust this evidence simply because it came from individuals connected to the Applicants\n. (emphasis added) [27]\nOther cases have looked at the particular circumstances and reiterated that evidence should not be discounted\nsolely\nbecause it is self serving. An additional passage in\nAhmed\n, is relevant, where Justice Mactavish applied that principle: [32] That said, although there are problems with the Board's findings regarding the evidentiary value of the letter in assessing the nature of Mr. Ahmed's involvement with the Anjuman Hussainia, these findings were not patently unreasonable. The Board noted that the letter was written long after the alleged incidents took place, and made no reference to any of Mr. Ahmed's accomplishments or specific responsibilities within the Anjuman organization. Further, the Board's negative credibility finding regarding Mr. Ahmed's problems with the SSP did not hinge solely on this letter. The Board questioned several aspects of his claim, including the very existence of a tailor shop, and the extent of Mr. Ahmed's involvement in the rally. In these circumstances, it was not patently unreasonable for the Board to view this letter as being of little probative value. [28]\nSimilarly in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Teitelbaum stated that while it is an error to attribute little probative value on the basis that the documents are self serving, other basis may support the low probative value attributed.\n\n[29]\nThe two issues raised by the applicant with respect to the declarations are related: whether the Officer assigned low probative value only because of the source of the declarations or for other reasons after an analysis of their contents; and, whether the Officer was required to specifically mention each one.\n\n[30]\nThe Officer referred to the statutory declarations from family and friends and he indicated that he gave \"these documents\" little weight. There is nothing on the record to suggest that the Officer ignored some of the declarations.\n\n[31]\nThe applicant submits that although the Officer says he considered all the evidence, he ignored the supporting declarations from friends. The applicant relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where Justice Evans noted at para 17 that \"Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.\"\n\n[32]\nI would also note the words of Justice Near in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  with respect to the applicability of this principle: [16] The Applicant relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 264, for the proposition that the Board committed a reviewable error by not at least acknowledging evidence that contradicted its finding regarding the Applicant's credibility. Cepeda is a seminal case often cited on judicial review when the Board has come to a conclusion that differs from information contained in a piece of evidence submitted by the Applicant. In this particular context it is important to remember that the general principle to be distilled from Cepeda's evolution into an all-purpose documentary evidence citation is that the more probative the evidence, the more likely the Court will find error when the Board ignores it (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  NR 394 at para 9).\n\n[33]\nIn this case, the Officer did not make any blanket statements about the statutory declarations. The Officer referred to the declarations from family and friends both generally and specifically. The Officer referred to the statutory declarations of the family members in consideration of the applicant's explanation for spending nights at his sister's home and the Officer referred to the brother-in-law's declaration regarding the address on the cell phone bill and to the sponsor's declaration regarding her single status for the purpose of the ODSP benefits.\n\n[34]\nWhile the Officer did not specifically refer to each of the statutory declarations from friends, he referred to his consideration of all the evidence before him. It must be recalled that the declarations were similar in content and the fact that the applicant and his sponsor had not been together since at least January, 2011 was not in dispute.\n\n[35]\nThe Officer acknowledged that the declarations sought to provide explanations for the applicant's time away from his sponsor, but based on the assessment of all the evidence, both in support and against, he gave the declarations low weight. As the respondent submits, the Officer was entitled to weigh all the evidence supporting the applicant with all the evidence provided by the CBSA investigation and the interviews and attribute low weight to the statutory declarations. The Court can not engage in a reweighing of the evidence.\n\n[36]\nI do not agree that the Officer overlooked or ignored any of the declarations or that he assigned low probative value only because the declarations were provided by his sister and brother-in-law and by neighbors.\n\n[37]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice O'Reilly considered the reasonableness of an Officer's decision that found the applicant and his spousal sponsor were not cohabiting and found that while there was evidence supporting the claim that the couple lived together, there was also contrary evidence. The Officer's decision which canvassed all the evidence was not unreasonable as it fell within the range of acceptable outcomes, based on the facts and the law.\nDid the Officer make unreasonable findings of fact?\n\n[38]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer erred in making unreasonable findings of fact on three significant issues; the couple's cohabitation; the pregnancy; and, the results of the CBSA investigation.\nCohabitation\n\n[39]\nFirst the applicant argues that the Officer failed to consider the applicable Operations Manual, OP 2, which provides guidance to officers about the meaning of cohabitation and which notes that while cohabitation means living together continuously, some separations which are temporary and short are contemplated. The applicant submits that although he was staying at his sister's home after the miscarriage, he also spent time with his sponsor and her children and, as noted in their statutory declarations, their separation was temporary. The applicant further submits that the Officer failed to consider that the couple have lived together continuously since his release from detention following his arrest in October, 2011.\n\n[40]\nThe respondent agrees that OP 2 contemplates exceptions to cohabitation such as absences due to work or illness of a short and temporary nature, but not due to relationship problems. The Officer based his findings with respect to cohabitation on all the evidence. Given that the Officer found that the sponsor had not been pregnant and had not had a miscarriage, the explanation cited for the separation was not accepted. Moreover, a period apart of over 10 months is not a short period and it was not assessed by the Officer to be temporary.\n\n[41]\nThe respondent also submits that the FOSS notes, which were considered by the Officer and form part of the reasons for the decision, include information which reasonably led to the finding that the couple were not cohabiting, all of which was set out in the procedural fairness letter.\n\n[42]\nThe Officer reasonably concluded that the applicant was not cohabiting with his sponsor. At his interview, the applicant indicated that he was \"gone\" after January, 2011. His explanations for why he resided with his sister and brother-in-law were not accepted as credible given the evasive answers he provided at the time of the arrest and the inconsistency in his responses at the interview with those of his sponsor. The Officer did not accept that the sponsor had been pregnant and, therefore, the explanation for the time apart had no foundation and no other credible reason was offered. The sponsor had not taken steps to advise ODSP that she was married and ODSP records confirmed that she remained listed as single. The applicant had admitted at his interview following his arrest that he had said that he did not support her so that she could continue to be eligible for the ODSP benefits.\nThe pregnancy\n\n[43]\nThe applicant submits that there was no evidentiary basis for the Officer to doubt that the sponsor had been pregnant and had a miscarriage. The applicant submits that the hospital emergency visit due to abdominal pain supports the sponsor's condition. In addition, both the applicant and the sponsor responded to the Officer's questions about the pregnancy at the interview.\n\n[44]\nThe respondent submits that there was no medical evidence to corroborate the assertion that the sponsor was pregnant and had miscarried. The hospital record merely recounted that the sponsor had said she had a positive pregnancy test, followed by a negative test. The purpose of the hospital visit was not due to the miscarriage. In addition, the applicant and respondent provided inconsistent answers at the interview with respect to their intention to have children.\n\n[45]\nThe Officer's finding that the sponsor had not been pregnant is not unreasonable. Although the Officer does not specifically refer to the lack of reliable medical evidence that one would expect could be provided to establish that the sponsor had been pregnant or had miscarried, the Officer noted that he was not satisfied based on \"the documentation provided\". In addition, the sponsor and the applicant had very different responses regarding how long they had been attempting to conceive.\nOver reliance on the CBSA investigation\n\n[46]\nThe applicant submits that the Officer placed too much reliance on the CBSA investigation but did not provide any details or dates of surveillance to the applicant.\n\n[47]\nAs noted by the respondent, all the allegations arising from the CBSA investigation were set out in the procedural fairness letter and the applicant provided submissions in response, therefore, there was no breach of procedural fairness.\n\n[48]\nWith respect to the applicant's submission that the officer overly relied on the CBSA investigation, it is not the role of the Court to reweigh the evidence. The CBSA letter and the FOSS notes were considered by the Officer and the Officer was entitled to place more probative value on this evidence than on the evidence provided by the applicant.\nConclusion\n\n[49]\nThe Officer's decision that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he \"cohabits with (his) sponsor in Canada\" as required by Regulation 124(a) of the\nIRPR\nwas reasonable. While there was some conflicting evidence, the officer justified his conclusions, which were noted in the reasons, and were based on his assessment of all the evidence.\n\n[50]\nThe judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[51]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application is dismissed.\n2. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant, Syed Waqas Ali Gilani, seeks, under section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], the judicial review of the decision of March 16, 2012 by which an immigration officer [the officer] at the Canada Immigration Center in Etobicoke, Ontario, rejected the applicant's application for permanent residence as a member of the spouse or common-law partner class in Canada, because he had not satisfied paragraph 124\nhas\n) of\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [the Regulations] which requires the applicant to show that they are the spouse of a guarantor and that they live with that guarantor in Canada.",
