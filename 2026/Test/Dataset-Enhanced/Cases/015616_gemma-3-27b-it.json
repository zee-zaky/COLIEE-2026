    "[1]\nHargrave, Prothonotary\n: This application, made \"ex parte\" on behalf of the plaintiffs, is for an order extending the time for service of the statement of claim for 12 months.",
    "[2]\nThe action arises out of damage to a consignment of plywood from Vancouver to Antwerp, Belgium, under Bills of Lading dated December 31, 1991.",
    "[3]\nThe plaintiffs commenced their action on February 12, 1993. The defendants, PCL European Service Ltd., Neptune Aries Shipping Corp. and the \"Florida Rainbow\" have not been served. There is no affidavit evidence setting out any attempts to serve those defendants, however the defendant Pacific Commerce Line Inc. is said to have been served at their Vancouver office.",
    "[4]\nOn the morning that the motion was heard the plaintiffs asked for and received an amendment to their Notice of Motion so that, as amended it referred to a reading of the pleadings and proceedings in addition to the May 18, 1994, affidavit of Marna Langner. This allowed counsel to refer to a supplemental affidavit filed May 26, 1994.",
    "[5]\nThe grounds set out for extending the time for service of the Statement of Claim on the \"Florida Rainbow\", as set out in a supplemental affidavit filed May 26, 1994, are that the vessel has not been in port locally since June 11, 1992, some time before the issuance of the statement of claim.",
    "[6]\nI have made an order extending the time for service of the statement of claim, on the \"Florida Rainbow\", for 12 months from the date of this order.",
    "[7]\nThis extension of the statement of claim, for \"in rem\" service, applied for after the initial time for the service of the statement of claim has expired, is based on the fairly exhaustive canvassing of the law by Sheppard, D.J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[8]\nAs set out in\nThe Captain Yiannis\n, if the \"Florida Rainbow\" has been within the Canadian jurisdiction, unknown to the plaintiffs, the \"ex parte\" order may be set aside.",
    "[9]\nExtension of time for service of the corporate defendants, \"in personam\", stands on a different footing. An extension of time is the exception. It should not be easily granted. It requires a sufficient reason: see for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).",
    "[10]\nCounsel noted that at some point, after the statement of claim was filed, the plaintiffs tried to settle the claim themselves. Following the return of the file by the plaintiffs, to their lawyers, service of the statement of claim on the balance of the defendants was overlooked.",
    "[11]\nCounsel referred to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). In the\nLaval Fortin\ncase the plaintiff's lawyer had given instructions to serve, but staff failed to send the material out for service. Mr. Justice Joyal, in extending the time for service of the statement of claim, noted that service had been intended, would have come as no surprise and was the sort of inadvertence that, based on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), was a mere slip in practice and not a laxity.",
    "[12]\nIn the present instance the affidavit material does not indicate anything in the nature of an overlooked diarization as in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  mere slip in practice.",
    "[13]\nThe affidavit material also seems to indicate that there were some settlement negotiations with Pacific Commerce Line Inc., the defendant which was in fact served, which did not lead to a resolution and, perhaps by extension, the negotiations were the reason that the balance of the defendants were not served.",
    "[14]\nA failure to serve a defendant because of settlement negotiations with some other party does not constitute a sufficient reason for granting an extension:\nDuval Sales Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  able to find, in the material, a sufficient reason for extending the time for service on the corporate defendants. Indeed, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.):\n\"... when the defendant was available for service and the plaintiff was not inhibited from serving or induced by the defendant not to serve, it is almost impossible to think of a 'sufficient reason' for not serving within the time fixed for serving.\" (p. 404)",
    "[15] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[16]\nAs I say, the time for serving the statement of claim on the vessel is extended for 12 months from today, but I will not grant an extension of time for serving the two remaining defendant companies.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/gas\n[End of document]"

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court distinguished between extending time for service *in rem* (against the vessel, “Florida Rainbow”) and *in personam* (against the corporate defendants).",
      "For *in rem* service against the vessel, the court relied on the precedent established in *Sheppard, D.J.*, which provides a framework for extending service time when a vessel has not been in port. The court acknowledged the possibility of setting aside the order if the vessel had been within Canadian jurisdiction unbeknownst to the plaintiffs, citing *The Captain Yiannis*.",
      "Regarding *in personam* service against the corporate defendants, the court held that extensions are exceptional and require a 'sufficient reason,' referencing case law like *<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (T.D.)*.",
      "The court found the plaintiffs’ explanation – that service was overlooked after the file was returned from settlement attempts – insufficient justification for extending the service period. It differentiated this situation from cases like *Laval Fortin*, where a clear intention to serve existed and the failure was a mere administrative slip, noting the present case lacked evidence of such a 'diarization' oversight.",
      "The court rejected the argument that settlement negotiations with one defendant excused the failure to serve others, citing *Duval Sales Corp.* and emphasizing that a defendant’s availability for service, without inhibition or inducement not to serve, makes it difficult to establish a 'sufficient reason' for delay, as highlighted by the Federal Court of Appeal in *<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (F.C.A.)*.",
      "Ultimately, the court granted the extension for service against the vessel but denied the extension for service against the corporate defendants, based on the lack of a 'sufficient reason' for the delay in the latter case."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "Time for service of the statement of claim on the vessel \"Florida Rainbow\" was extended for 12 months from the date of the order.",
      "Application for extension of time for service on the two remaining defendant companies was denied."
