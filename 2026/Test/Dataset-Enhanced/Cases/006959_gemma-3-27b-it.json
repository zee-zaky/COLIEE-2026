    "[1]\nRouleau, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review by the Applicant, Lakhbir Singh, a citizen of India who had claimed refugee status upon his arrival in December 2004.",
    "[2]\nIn this motion for judicial review the applicant is challenging the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board which had declared Mr. Singh's claim as being abandoned.",
    "[3]\nThe initial date scheduled for the hearing of his refugee application was November 23, 2005. On that day the applicant failed to appear; his counsel was present as well as a friend who advised the Chairperson that Mr. Singh had been admitted to the hospital the day before. The Board then advised both counsel and the friend that the matter was rescheduled for December 12, 2005 and that the applicant would be provided with an opportunity to show cause why his claim to convention refugee status should not be declared abandoned.",
    "[4]\nThe parties were also advised that the applicant should produce a medical certificate to justify his inability to attend on November 23, 2005.",
    "[5]\nDuring the course of discussion between the Chairperson and counsel for the applicant on November 23, 2005, it was initially suggested that the matter proceed on December 12, 2005 as a full refugee hearing. It was determined by the Chairperson and counsel for the applicant that they both had other matters proceeding on that day and, as a result, it was agreed that the parties would appear at 8:45 a.m. simply to determine whether or not the claim should be considered abandoned; a show cause hearing.",
    "[6]\nOn December 12, 2005, Mr. Singh was present along with his counsel. The Chairman immediately requested a medical certificate from the applicant in order to substantiate and justify his failure to appear on November 23. The applicant testified that he had requested a medical report on the 8th day of December 2005 but was advised by the attending physician that he would not provide him with any document; that he proceed to the medical records office and obtain from them an attestation that he had been hospitalised on November 22, 2005 for a few days. He was advised by the medical records attendant that such a document would take three to four weeks. The applicant nevertheless produced for the panel a document dated December 5, 2005 issued by the Emergency Department of the hospital in which it is indicated that he had been seen by an emergency physician on the 22nd of November, 2005 and was billed $125.00 for the services. This document also indicated that if he had refugee status to send a copy of his citizenship and immigration identification form. He also produced a medication prescription form duly signed by the attending physician also dated November 22, 2005. Part of the documents submitted was his request to Immigration Canada dated September 20. 2005 indicating that he had misplaced his medical ID and seeking a replacement since he was having medical problems, it indicated he had high blood pressure and diabetes problems.",
    "[7]\nThe Chairman was not satisfied with these documents and declared the claim abandoned.",
    "[8]\nThe Court is somewhat offended by the rather inequitable and unkind treatment that this refugee claimant was subjected to. It was evident that the Chairperson was constrained with respect to time since he himself admitted at the hearing on the 23rd of November, 2005 that he could not proceed with a full refugee claim hearing on December 12, 2005. And, it is rather strange to note that this Chairperson admits that he is not very highly thought of in the immigrant indian community in the area and I quote the presiding member's own words:\n\"You see, sir, one of your colleagues told me, he told us a few weeks ago while he testifying in his own case, that when the people of your community see that I am the one who is presiding the case, all the members of your community try to go to the hospital in order not to pass in front of me. So it seems to be a pattern of the members of the members of your community to do everything possible in order for them not to pass in front of me ...\"",
    "[9]\nIt is evident that this presiding member is not very highly thought of or respected among a certain class of refugee claimants.",
    "[10]\nThere is no doubt that it is entirely in his discretion to determine whether or not a claim should be determined abandoned. It appears that in this particular case we have an individual who required an interpreter, who produced some documents to justify his absence and corroborate his allegation of illness but who, undoubtedly, was going to be given a curt hearing at 8:45 in the morning of December 12, 2005.",
    "[11]\nCounsel for the Crown cited numerous authorities supporting her position that the abandonment order must be upheld. I have reviewed these authorities and note that in every case except one the Chairperson had determined the matter to be abandoned since the applicants had not appeared on one or in many cases two occasions scheduled for the hearing of their refugee claim. One of the authorities submitted by counsel for the Crown was\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2005 FC 908, where Justice von Finckenstein wrote at paragraph 10:\n\"The test for determining whether a claim has been abandoned is whether the refugee claimant's conduct amounts to a lack of intention to pursue the claim with diligence.\"",
    "[12]\nIt appears somewhat evident that this Chairperson had no intention of proceeding with a refugee claim hearing when he determined on November 23, 2005 that he had very little time at his disposal on December 12, 2005.",
    "[13]\nIn the present case we have some medical evidence to justify the applicant's absence on November 23, 2005 and it was patently unreasonable for the Chairperson to find the claim abandoned since the applicant did not request a medical certificate soon enough. At no time did the Chairperson even enquire of the applicant if he wished to abandon his claim or pursue it further.",
    "[14]\nWhen dealing with abandonment claims, this Court has clearly stated that the question the Board must ask itself is whether or not the Applicant truly intended to abandon his claim; see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 184 F.T.R. 283; 4 Imm. L.R.(3d) 91 (T.D.), at paragraph 32 and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[15]\nRule 169 of the (\nIRPR\n) states that a Board can deem a claim abandoned for the following reasons:\n\"169. An application for protection is declared abandoned\n(a) in the case of an applicant who fails to appear at a hearing, if the applicant is given notice of a subsequent hearing and fails to appear at that hearing; and\n(b) in the case of an applicant who voluntarily departs Canada, when the applicant's removal order is enforced under section 240 or the applicant otherwise departs Canada.\"\n\"169. Le désistement d'une demande de protection est prononcé:\na) dans le cas où le demandeur omet de se présenter à une audience, lorsqu'il omet de se présenter à une audience ultérieure dont il a reçu avis;\nb) dans le cas où le demandeur quitte volontairement le Canada, lorsque la mesure de renvoi est exécutée en application de l'article 240 ou lorsqu'il quitte autrement le Canada.\"",
    "[16]\nIn addition to the above mentioned rule, Rule 58 of the\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n(\nRPDR\n) states that:\n\"58(1) A claim may be declared abandoned, without giving the claimant an opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned, if\n(a) the Division has not received the claimant's contact information and their Personal Information Form within 28 days after the claimant received the form; and\n(b) the Minister and the claimant's counsel, if any, do not have the claimant's contact information.\n\"Opportunity to explain\n\"(2) In every other case, the Division must give the claimant an opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned. The Division must give this opportunity\n(a) immediately, if the claimant is present at the hearing and the Division considers that it is fair to do so; gold\n(b) in any other case, by way of a special hearing after notifying the claimant in writing.\n“Factors to consider\n\"(3) The Division must consider, in deciding whether the claim should be declared abandoned, the explanations given by the claimant at the hearing and any other relevant information, including the fact that the claimant is ready to start or continue the proceedings.\n\"Decision to start or continue the proceedings\n\"(4) If the Division decides not to declare the claim abandoned, it must start or continue the proceedings without delay.\"\n\"58(1) The Division may declare the withdrawal of an application for asylum without giving the asylum seeker the opportunity to explain why the withdrawal should not be pronounced if, at the same time:\n(a) she has not received either the contact details or the personal information form of the asylum seeker within twenty-eight days following the date on which the latter received the form;\n(b) neither the Minister nor the asylum seeker's counsel, where applicable, knows these contact details.\n\"Possibility to explain\n\"(2) In any other case, the Section gives the asylum seeker the opportunity to explain why the withdrawal should not be made. It gives him this opportunity:\n(a) immediately, if he is present at the hearing and the Division considers it equitable to do so;\n(b) otherwise, at a special hearing of which the Section has notified him in writing.\n\"Things to consider\n\"(3) In deciding whether to withdraw the application, the Section shall take into consideration the explanations given by the asylum seeker at the hearing and any other relevant element, in particular the fact that the asylum seeker is ready to begin or continue the case.\n\"Continuation of the case\n\"(4) If the Section decides not to discontinue the case, it shall commence or continue the case without delay.\"",
    "[17]\nIt is evident that this applicant did not contravene Rule 169 of the\nIRPR\n. A review of Rule 58 indicates that the applicant should be given an opportunity to explain why his application should not be declared abandoned and be given an opportunity to justify his conduct. The rule further goes on to explain that in the event that the Division decides not to declare the claim abandoned, it must start or continue the proceeding without delay. It is obvious that this was not the Chairperson's intention when he even scheduled this matter for a show cause hearing.",
    "[18]\nThe applicable standard of review in abandonment cases is reasonabless simpliciter and I am not satisfied that the reasons given by the Chairperson could withstand a probing examination.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[19]\nFor the foregoing reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed. The matter will be returned for a full refugee hearing before a panel which shall exclude the member who presided on November 23, 2005 and December 12, 2005.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E.

    "factual_background": [
      "An Indian citizen, Lakhbir Singh, applied for refugee status in December 2004.",
      "A hearing for his refugee application was initially scheduled for November 23, 2005.",
      "Mr. Singh did not appear at the November 23, 2005 hearing; his counsel and a friend were present and informed the board he was hospitalized.",
      "The hearing was rescheduled for December 12, 2005, with a requirement for Mr. Singh to provide a medical certificate.",
      "The parties agreed the December 12th hearing would be limited to determining whether the claim should be considered abandoned.",
      "On December 12, 2005, Mr. Singh attended with counsel and presented documentation including a hospital emergency department record dated November 22, 2005, and a prescription.",
      "Mr. Singh stated he was unable to obtain a formal medical certificate in time, as it would take several weeks to process.",
      "He had previously requested a replacement medical ID in September 2005 due to high blood pressure and diabetes.",
      "The Chairperson declared Mr. Singh’s refugee claim abandoned after reviewing the submitted documentation.",
      "The Chairperson noted a perceived pattern of individuals from Mr. Singh’s community avoiding appearances before him."

    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The claim should not have been declared abandoned because the applicant presented some medical evidence (hospital visit on November 22, 2005, and a prescription) to justify his absence on November 23, 2005.",
        "The applicant requested a medical certificate but was told it would take 3-4 weeks to obtain from the medical records office.",
        "The applicant did not intend to abandon his claim.",
        "The Chairperson did not inquire whether the applicant wished to abandon his claim or pursue it further.",
        "The Chairperson appeared predisposed against individuals from the applicant’s community.",
        "The Chairperson scheduled the December 12th hearing knowing he had limited time and it was effectively a show cause hearing only, suggesting a lack of intention to proceed with a full hearing."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The applicant failed to appear at the originally scheduled hearing on November 23, 2005.",
        "The applicant failed to provide a sufficient medical certificate to justify his absence on November 23, 2005.",
        "The applicant’s conduct amounted to a lack of intention to pursue the claim with diligence (citing the test from *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Wang*).",
        "The claim was properly abandoned under Rule 169 of the IRPR, as the applicant failed to appear at subsequent hearings.",
        "The procedures outlined in Rule 58 of the RPDR were followed."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found the Refugee Protection Division’s decision to declare the claim abandoned unreasonable, despite acknowledging the Chairperson’s discretion in such matters.",
      "The court was critical of the Chairperson’s apparent lack of intention to genuinely hear the refugee claim, noting his admission of time constraints and his own perception of negative sentiment from the applicant’s community.",
      "The court determined the Chairperson failed to adequately consider the medical evidence presented by the applicant, even though it corroborated his reason for missing the initial hearing, and unreasonably focused on the timing of obtaining a medical certificate.",
      "The court emphasized that the central question in abandonment cases is whether the applicant *intended* to abandon their claim, and found no evidence of such intent here.",
      "The court interpreted the relevant regulations (IRPR Rule 169 and RPDR Rule 58) to require the Board to provide the applicant with a meaningful opportunity to explain their absence and justify their claim before declaring it abandoned, which the court found lacking in this case.",
      "The court applied the ‘reasonableness simpliciter’ standard of review and concluded the Chairperson’s reasons for declaring the claim abandoned did not withstand scrutiny, particularly given the available medical documentation and the lack of inquiry into the applicant’s desire to continue the claim.",
      "The court ordered a full refugee hearing before a different panel, excluding the original Chairperson, to ensure a fair and proper assessment of the claim."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application for judicial review is allowed.",
      "The matter is returned for a full refugee hearing before a panel excluding the member who presided on November 23, 2005 and December 12, 2005."
