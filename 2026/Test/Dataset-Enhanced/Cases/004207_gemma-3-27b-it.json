    "[1]\nPhelan, J.\n: The Applicant was denied refugee status. The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) decision was based upon credibility and plausibility findings. A critical aspect of the credibility finding was the alleged discrepancy between the notes of her interview at Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and the testimony before the Board. This judicial review raises, amongst other grounds, the issue of proper translation and the appropriateness of plausibility findings.\nII. BACKGROUND",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant, a Chinese national, was persuaded to attend at a house church on\na regular basis. The group had eleven members, two of whom would act as lookouts at each meeting.",
    "[3]\nThe Applicants evidence was that the religious services were discovered by the Chinese Public Security Bureau (PSB) but that as a result of the lookouts warnings, she escaped. She then escaped from China with the assistance of snakeheads using her own passport.",
    "[4]\nThe Board found the Applicant not to be a credible witness and not a member of an underground church. The Board noted that there were inconsistencies between her CIC interview, her PIF narrative and her evidence at the Board hearing.",
    "[5]\nThe Board also noted in their submissions that there was confusion in her evidence because the translator at the CIC interview was a native Cantonese speaker translating from Mandarin to English. The Board went so far as to acknowledge the possibility of problems, even to extending the benefit of the doubt on credibility findings due to possible translation problems in the similarity in numbers. It also went on to make plausibility findings in areas where there were discrepancies.",
    "[6]\nThe Applicant filed an affidavit from a Chinese language expert attesting to the possible difficulties a native Cantonese speaker would have with Mandarin and translation from Mandarin to English.",
    "[7]\nThe Board also made a finding that the Applicants story about escaping the church was not plausible because the PSB would have surrounded the church before raiding it. The Board was of the view that escape would have been impossible.",

    "[9]\nOne of the sources of the translation issues is at the CIC interview. The interview is not recorded in its original form. What exists are the notes of the English translated version of the Applicants testimony. Therefore, any difficulties would not be apparent to the Applicant if there was a misunderstanding in the translation. CIC does not take the step of reading back the interview notes to ensure their accuracy.",

The Applicant is not required to show that he has suffered actual prejudice as a result of the breach of the standard of interpretation in order for this Court to interfere with the decision of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[12]\nAs important as this right is, the burden on a person raising interpretation issues is significant. Such a claim must overcome the presumption that a translator, who has taken an oath to provide faithful translation, has acted in a manner contrary to the oath. Simply alleging mis-translation will not be sufficient  the burden is to show that on a balance of probabilities mis-translation occurred.",
    "[13]\nIn this instance the Applicant has met this burden through a combination of factors including expert but circumstantial evidence and, most importantly, the Boards own acknowledgement and concession as to the relevance of the problem to its credibility findings.",
    "[14]\nI will not conclude that the CIC has an absolute obligation to read back interview notes to ensure accuracy. There may be good reason for not doing so including having spontaneous rather than tailored responses.
