    "[1]\nShore, J.\n: In the Chan decision, the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a status claimant has the burden of demonstrating the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution. This fear includes both a subjective and objective element and only the existence of these two elements allows us to conclude that a serious possibility of persecution is attached to it:\nBoth the existence of a subjective fear and the objective basis of this fear must be established on the balance of probabilities. [...] The applicable test has been described as the existence of a reasonable possibility or, more aptly in my opinion, a serious possibility.\n(<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (QL))\nNATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE\nE",
    "[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (Act) of the decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) dated August 18, 2005, that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\nFACTS",
    "[3]\nThe applicants, Ruben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, his wife Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron, and their son Brian Dario Modernell Rodriguez, are citizens of Uruguay. The familys application is based on Mr. Modernell Gilgorris story.",
    "[4]\nMs. Rodriguez Padron worked for a few years in a pharmacy while Mr. Modernell Gilgorri, after having studied in electricity, was a self-employed electrician and sold various products.",
    "[5]\nIn mid-December 2002, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was elected as a member of the local Community Centre Management. Shortly thereafter, he noticed that members of the executive committee were appropriating funds meant for the community. In February 2003, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri reported this misappropriation of funds. Mr. Modernell Gilgorri alleges that three individuals attacked him, but he did not file a police report because he was not able to identify his attackers.",
    "[6]\nAfter this attack, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri stopped attending the Executive Committee meetings but he continued his community work with the underprivileged population of his neighbourhood.",
    "[7]\nIn December 2003, at the general assembly of the Community Centre Management, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri condemned the misappropriation of funds. Several individuals demanded the resignation of the members of the Executive Committee who were, according to Mr. Modernell Gilgorri, members of the Uruguayan Communist Party.",
    "[8]\nThen, in April 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri met Alejandro Fernandez, a former member of the Executive Committee, who pointed out that he had not forgotten him.",
    "[9]\nIn May 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was assaulted by four individuals when he was returning home at night. He filed a police report. Following the complaint and the police investigation, Alejandro Fernandez was arrested and detained for assaulting Mr. Modernell Gilgorri.",
    "[10]\nNearing the end of May and the beginning of June 2004, Rodriguez Padron was assaulted and their son was threatened repeatedly. In September 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was threatened in turn; he was told that he would be killed if he did not withdraw the charges.",
    "[11]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri then decided to leave the country with his family. They left Uruguay on October 28, 2004, by bus bound for Canada through Argentine, Chili, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa-Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and finally the United States. They crossed the Lacolle border on November 24, 2004, and claimed protection from Canada.\nIMPUGNED DECISION",
    "[12]\nThe Board determined that they were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection since it did not see a connection with the Convention and since Mr. Modernell Gilgorri did not wait for the Uruguayan police and judicial authorities to do their job.",
    "[13]\nThe Board determined that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family are rather faced with a fear of personal vengeance. It is more a problem of local crime than an issue of persecution. The Board is of the opinion that the authorities acted in accordance with the norms, i.e. that they investigated and brought Alejandro Fernandez to trial following Mr. Modernell Gilgorri s complaint.",
    "[14]\nThe Board doubted the validity of the fear of Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family. It found that their conduct was inconsistent with the conduct of reasonable persons having a fear of persecution and seeking international protection. In fact, they travelled through 12 countries before arriving in Canada but did not seek protection in any of those countries.\nISSUES",
    "[15]\nThe parties raised the following issues:\n1. Did the Board err in determining that the principal applicant was not credible with respect to the alleged fear of persecution?\n2. Did the Board err in determining that the applicants did not meet their burden of proof of establishing that they could not benefit from the protection of the State of Uruguay?\n3. Did the Board err in determining that the applicants had an internal flight alternative?\nANALYSIS\nStandard of review",
    "[16]\nWith its expertise, the Board is the tribunal in the best position to weigh the facts, particularly when it is a matter of assessing the witnesses credibility and the evidence filed with regard to the definition of Convention refugee.\nThere is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 4)",
    "[17]\nThis Court has on numerous occasions reiterated that the principle of patent unreasonableness applies to decisions by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 9-15;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 8-9;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 10-11;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).",
    "[18]\nThe Board has a well-established expertise with regard to assessing the facts, particularly in assessing the credibility of refugee claimants and the availability of protection offered by the country of origin ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).",
    "[19]\nThe question of whether there is an internal flight alternative is itself also a question of fact. The standard of review is therefore that of patent unreasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1263 (QL), at paragraphs 9-10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1606 (QL), at paragraph 10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 2171 (QL), at paragraph 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 463 (QL), at paragraph 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1912 (QL), at paragraph 18).\nCredibility and fear of persecution",
    "[20]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri alleges that he fears that Alejandro Fernandez, member of the Uruguayan Communist Party and former member of the local community centre, will persecute him. Mr. Modernell Gilgorri says that he fears him because of his political beliefs and because he reported him to the police which led to his arrest, charges and a trial.",
    "[21]\nApart from fleeing Uruguay because of Fernandezs threats, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri pointed out at the hearing that his goal was to come to Canada in order to escape the misery existing in his own country.",
    "[22]\nIn this matter, the Boards determination can be inferred reasonably from the evidence. The simple fact that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family interpret the evidence differently does not at all establish that the Board made a determinative error in its own interpretation of the evidence or in the inferences that it made therefrom.",
    "[23]\nFurther, the Board made a negative finding with respect to the conduct of Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family, which was incompatible with the conduct of persons having a well-founded fear of persecution. The Board points out that they left Uruguay for Canada via 12 South American, Central American and North American countries. They did not claim protection from any of these countries.",
    "[24]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 2, Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay states the following:\nThe basis of that conclusion was that his conduct subsequent to leaving Romania in July 1992 was inconsistent with a fear of persecution and his delay in claiming refugee status until he arrived in Canada in February 1993 negated a well-founded fear of persecution.",
    "[25]\nSimilarly, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 14, Mr. Justice Max Teitelbaum states as follows:\n. . . Failure to immediately seek protection can impugn the claimant's credibility, including his or her testimony about events in his country of origin . . .",
    "[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 7 and 12, Mr. Justice Francis Muldoon writes the following:\n. . . One might observe that he passed through Amsterdam and that The Netherlands is a convention refugee signatory, but apparently he did not think to claim refugee status there.\n. . .\n. . . Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.",
    "[27]\nReferring to several other decisions bearing on this very subject, Mr. Justice Edmond Blanchard states, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 27:\n. . .The fact of passing through a country which is a signatory of the Convention without claiming refugee status as quickly as possible may be one factor in assessing the subjective aspects of her claim.",
    "[28]\nThe Board was entitled to determine that it was a fear characterized by Alejandro Fernandezs need for personal vengeance. In other words, the alleged fear of persecution is not related to the grounds listed in the Convention. Personal vengeance has no connection with grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, which are the grounds set out in the definition of Convention refugee.",
    "[29]\nThis principle was established inter alia by Madam Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):\nIn view of the facts in the record the panel could have concluded as it did that the fear mentioned by the applicant was not connected to any of the five grounds listed in the definition of a Convention refugee. The fear of personal vengeance is not a fear of persecution. In these circumstances, I cannot intervene.",
    "[30]\nIn  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a refugee claimant has the burden of establishing the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution. This fear has a subjective and objective element, and a serious possibility of persecution can be found only where both of these elements exist.",
    "[31]\nOn that point, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer said the following in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 10:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definitionsubjective and objectivemust be met.",
    "[32]\nAccordingly, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that they had a subjective fear of persecution if they were to return to Uruguay. The lack of a subjective fear of persecution signifies that the Board need not identify the objective basis of the alleged fear based on any independent documentary evidence.\nState protection",
    "[33]\nThe Board was preoccupied by the fact that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not wait for the judicial process initiated by the judicial authorities to be completed. They decided to leave their country and Mr. Modernell Gilgorri did not testify at the trial of Alejandro Fernandez, who was arrested and detained following Mr. Modernell Gilgorris report to the police.",
    "[34]\nIt is important to remember the principle established in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 50, namely that the evidence must be clear and convincing to rebut the presumption that a State is able to guarantee the protection of its nationals:\nThere is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden.",
    "[35]\nFurther, the Court of Appeal has already stated that no country can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. . . . On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\n(Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 7)",
    "[36]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not meet their burden of proof of establishing that they were not being protected by their State.",
    "[37]\nThe determinations made by the Board can reasonably be inferred from the evidence filed. The presumption to the effect that the Board considered all of the evidence in determining that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection is applicable in this case ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nInternal flight alternative",
    "[38]\nWhen there is an internal flight alternative, it is not necessary to determine whether a claimant is able or willing to obtain protection from the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 14).",
    "[39]\nIt is the claimants responsibility to establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution in the entire country, therefore that there is no internal flight alternative ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1747 (QL), at paragraph 17; E.H.S., supra, at paragraphs 13-14).",
    "[40]\nIn E.H.S., supra, at paragraph 12, Mr. Justice Pierre Blais sets out the test for determining whether there is an internal flight alternative:\nThe Federal Court of Appeal developed a two-part test to determine whether a person claiming refugee status has an IFA in another part of their country. The test was clearly reiterated by Beaudry J.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  v. (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 463, at paragraph 11:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) at paragraph 2, the Federal Court of Appeal listed two elements to be considered when establishing an IFA: the Board must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists, and, taking into account all the circumstances, including those specific to the applicant, the situation in the proposed location must be such that it would not be unreasonable for the applicant to seek shelter there.",
    "[41]\nIn this case, the Board determined that there was an internal flight alternative in Uruguay. When Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was questioned on that point, he said that the State was too small for him to find safety elsewhere and that he did not have enough money to move elsewhere in the country. He also said that he had not considered the possibility of moving elsewhere.",
    "[42]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not show the Board that they were at risk of being persecuted everywhere across Uruguay. They did not establish that it would be unreasonable for them to go elsewhere in Uruguay to seek refuge. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to determine that there was an internal flight alternative and therefore that it was not justified in granting protection to Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[43]\nConsidering the foregoing, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that the Board made a patently unreasonable error in law or in assessing the facts that would justify the intervention of this Court. This application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[44]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée;\n2. Aucune question grave de portée générale soit certifiée.\n.........................\nRuben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a refugee claimant has the burden of establishing that a well-founded fear of persecution exists. This fear has an element that is both subjective and objective and only the existence of both of these elements supports a determination that there is a serious possibility of persecution:\nBoth the existence of the subjective fear and the fact that the fear is objectively well-founded must be established on a balance of probabilities. In the specific context of refugee determination, it has been established by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the claimant need not prove that persecution would be more likely than not in order to meet the objective portion of the test. The claimant must establish, however, that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution. The applicable test has been expressed as a reasonable possibility or, more appropriately in my view, as a serious possibility.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\nNATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING"

Cette crainte comporte à la fois un élément subjectif et objectif et seule l'existence de ces deux éléments permet de conclure qu'une possibilité sérieuse de persécution s'y rattache :\nTant l'existence d'une crainte subjective que le fondement objectif de cette crainte doivent être établis selon la prépondérance des probabilités. [...] On a décrit le critère applicable comme étant l'existence d'une  possibilité raisonnable  ou, plus justement à mon avis, d'une  possibilité sérieuse  .\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL))\nNATURE DE LA PROCÉDURE JUDICIAIR\nE\n[2]\nIl s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, c. 27 (Loi) de la décision de la Section de protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (Commission) datée du 18 août 2005 par laquelle il a été décidé que les demandeurs n'ont pas la qualité de réfugiés au sens de la Convention ou de personnes à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la Loi.\nFAITS\n[3]\nLes demandeurs, monsieur Ruben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, son épouse, madame Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron, et leur fils, Brian Dario Modernell Rodriguez, sont citoyens de l'Uruguay. La famille base sa demande sur le récit de monsieur Modernell Gilgorri.\n[4]\nMadame Rodriguez Padron travaille quelques années dans une pharmacie alors que monsieur Modernell Gilgorri, après avoir étudié en électricité, travaille à son compte à titre d'électricien et vendeur de divers produits.\n[5]\nÀ la mi-décembre 2002, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri est élu à titre de membre de la Direction du Centre communautaire local. Peu après, il s'aperçoit que des membres du Comité exécutif s'approprient l'argent destiné à la collectivité. En février 2003, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri dénonce ce détournement de fonds. Monsieur Modernell Gilgorri allègue alors avoir subi une agression par trois personnes mais il n'a pas porté plainte à la police parce qu'il n'était pas en mesure d'identifier ses agresseurs.\n[6]\nAprès cette agression, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri cesse d'assister aux réunions du Comité exécutif mais il poursuit ses travaux communautaires auprès de la population défavorisée de son quartier.\n[7]\nEn décembre 2003, lors de l'assemblée générale de la Direction du Centre communautaire, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri dénonce le détournement de fonds. Plusieurs personnes réclament la démission des membres du Comité exécutif qui sont, selon monsieur Modernell Gilgorri, membres du Parti communiste uruguayen.\n[8]\nPuis, en avril 2004, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri rencontre Alejandro Fernandez, un ancien membre du Comité exécutif, qui souligne qu'il ne l'a pas oublié.\n[9]\nEn mai 2004, alors qu'il retourne à la maison le soir, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri est agressé par quatre individus. Il porte plainte à la police. Suite à la dénonciation et à l'enquête de la police, Alejandro Fernandez est arrêté et détenu pour agression à l'encontre de monsieur Modernell Gilgorri.\n[10]\nVers la fin mai et le début juin 2004, Madame Rodriguez Padron est agressée et leur fils est menacé à plusieurs reprises. En septembre 2004, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri est menacé à son tour, on lui dit que s'il ne retire pas les accusations, il sera tué.\n[11]\nMonsieur Modernell Gilgorri décide alors de quitter le pays avec sa famille. Ils quittent l'Uruguay le 28 octobre 2004 en autobus à destination du Canada via l'Argentine, le Chili, le Pérou, l'Équateur, la Colombie, le Panama, le Costa-Rica, le Nicaragua, El Salvador, le Guatémala, le Mexique et finalement les États-Unis. Ils traversent la frontière de Lacolle le 24 novembre 2004 et réclament la protection du Canada.\nDÉCISION CONTESTÉE\n[12]\nLa Commission conclue qu'ils ne sont pas des réfugiés au sens de la Convention ou des personnes à protéger puisqu'elle ne voit pas de lien avec la Convention et que monsieur Modernell Gilgorri n'a pas attendu que les autorités policières et judiciaires uruguayennes fassent leur travail.\n[13]\nLa Commission détermine que monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille sont davantage confrontés à une crainte de vengeance personnelle. Il s'agit davantage d'un problème de criminalité locale que d'une question de persécution. La Commission est d'avis que les autorités ont agi selon les normes, c'est-à-dire qu'elles ont enquêté et introduit un procès contre Alejandro Fernandez suite à la plainte de monsieur Modernell Gilgorri.\n[14]\nLa Commission doute de la validité de la crainte de monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille. Elle trouve que leur comportement est incompatible avec celui de personnes raisonnables ayant une crainte de persécution et recherchant la protection internationale. En effet, ils ont traversé douze pays avant d'arriver au Canada mais n'ont pas demandé l'asile dans aucun de ces pays.\nQUESTIONS EN LITIGE\n[15]\nLes parties soulèvent les questions en litige suivantes :\n1. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que le demandeur principal n'était pas crédible eu égard à la crainte de persécution alléguée?\n2. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que les demandeurs ne se sont pas déchargés de leur fardeau de preuve afin de démontrer qu'ils ne pouvaient pas bénéficier de la protection de l'État de l'Uruguay?\n3. La Commission a-t-elle commis une erreur en concluant que les demandeurs pouvaient bénéficier d'un refuge interne?\nANALYSE\nNorme de contrôle\n[16]\nGrâce à son expertise, la Commission est le tribunal le mieux placé pour apprécier les faits, particulièrement lorsqu'il s'agit d'évaluer la crédibilité des témoins et la preuve présentée relative à la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que le tribunal spécialisé qu'est la section du statut de réfugié a pleine compétence pour apprécier la plausibilité d'un témoignage. Qui, en effet, mieux que lui, est en mesure de jauger la crédibilité d'un récit et de tirer les inférences qui s'imposent? Dans la mesure où les inférences que le tribunal tire ne sont pas déraisonnables au point d'attirer notre intervention, ses conclusions sont à l'abri du contrôle judiciaire. Dans Giron, la Cour n'a fait que constater que dans le domaine de la plausibilité, le caractère déraisonnable d'une décision peut être davantage palpable, donc plus facilement identifiable, puisque le récit apparaît à la face même du dossier. Giron, à notre avis, ne diminue en rien le fardeau d'un appelant de démontrer que les inférences tirées par le tribunal ne pouvaient pas raisonnablement l'être. L'appelant, en l'espèce, ne s'est pas déchargé de ce fardeau.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 4)\n[17]\nCette Cour a réitéré à de nombreuses reprises que le principe de la norme manifestement déraisonnable s'appliquait aux décisions de la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), aux paragraphes 9-15;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), aux paragraphes 8-9;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), aux paragraphes 10-11;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL))\n[18]\nLa Commission détient une expertise bien reconnue eu égard à l'appréciation des faits, particulièrement dans l'évaluation de la crédibilité des personnes revendiquant le statut de réfugié et dans la disponibilité de la protection offerte par le pays d'origine. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (QL))\n[19]\nLa question de savoir s'il existe une possibilité de refuge interne est celle aussi une question de fait. La norme de contrôle applicable est donc celle de la décision manifestement déraisonnable. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] A.C.F. no 1263 (QL), aux paragraphes 9-10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 1606 (QL), au paragraphe 10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 2171 (QL), au paragraphe 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] A.C.F. no 463 (QL), au paragraphe 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 1912 (QL), au paragraphe 18)\nCrédibilité et crainte de persécution\n[20]\nMonsieur Modernell Gilgorri allègue qu'il craint d'être persécuté par Alejandro Fernandez, membre du Parti communiste uruguayen et ancien membre du centre communautaire local. Monsieur Modernell Gilgorri dit craindre ce dernier en raison de ses opinions politiques et parce qu'il l'a dénoncé à la police ce qui a mené à son arrestation, des accusations et un procès.\n[21]\nEn plus de fuir l'Uruguay à cause des menaces de Fernandez, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri a souligné durant l'audience qu'il avait pour but de venir au Canada afin de quitter la misère qui existe dans son pays.\n[22]\nDans le présent dossier, les conclusions de la Commission s'infèrent raisonnablement de la preuve. Le simple fait que monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille interprètent la preuve différemment n'établit aucunement que la Commission aurait commis une erreur déterminante dans sa propre interprétation de la preuve ainsi que dans les inférences qu'elle en a tirées.\n[23]\nDe plus, la Commission a tiré une conclusion négative quant au comportement incompatible de monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille avec celui des personnes ayant une crainte bien fondée de persécution. La Commission souligne qu'ils ont quitté l'Uruguay à destination du Canada via douze pays d'Amérique du sud, d'Amérique centrale et d'Amérique du nord. Ils n'ont pas revendiqué la protection d'aucun de ces pays.\n[24]\nDans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 2, le juge Andrew MacKay a tenu les propos suivants :\nCette conclusion s'appuie sur la conviction que la conduite du requérant après son départ de la Roumanie en juillet 1992 était incompatible avec une crainte de persécution et que le fait qu'il n'ait pas revendiqué le statut de réfugié avant d'arriver au Canada en février 1993 démontrait qu'il n'avait pas de crainte bien fondée de persécution.\n[25]\nDe même, dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 14, le juge Max Teitelbaum affirme ce qui suit :\n...L'omission de demander immédiatement protection peut attaquer la crédibilité du demandeur, y compris son témoignage sur les événements survenus dans son pays d'origine...\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), aux paragraphes 7 et 12, le juge Francis Muldoon écrit ce qui suit :\n...On pourrait observer qu'il est passé par Amsterdam et que les Pays-Bas sont au nombre des signataires de la Convention du statut de réfugié mais, apparemment, le requérant n'a pas songé à y réclamer ce statut.\n...\nTout comme je ne souhaite pas renvoyer dans son pays une personne qui risque d'y être persécutée, je ne veux pas non plus que demeure au Canada une personne qui n'a pas le droit de s'y trouver; par exemple, une personne qui est passée par un pays signataire de la Convention du statut de réfugié et qui n'a pas songé à y réclamer ce statut.\n[27]\nRéférant à plusieurs autres décisions portent sur ce même sujet, le juge Edmond Blanchard énonce, dans  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 27 :\n...Le fait d'être de passage dans un pays signataire de la Convention sans toutefois revendiquer le statut de réfugié dans les plus brefs délais peut être un facteur dans l'appréciation des facteurs subjectifs de sa revendication.\n[28]\nC'est à juste titre que la Commission a conclu qu'il s'agit d'une crainte caractérisée par le besoin de vengeance personnelle d'Alejandro Fernandez. Autrement dit, la crainte alléguée de persécution n'a pas de lien avec les motifs énumérés à la Convention. La vengeance personnelle n'est pas liée aux motifs de race, religion, nationalité, opinions politiques ou appartenance à un groupe social, qui sont les motifs énoncés à la définition de réfugié au sens de la Convention.\n[29]\nCe principe a notamment été établi par la juge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL) :\nVu les faits présents au dossier, il lui était loisible de conclure comme il l'a fait que la crainte dont fait état le requérant n'était pas reliée à aucun des cinq motifs énumérés à la définition de  réfugié  au sens de la Convention. La crainte d'une vengeance personnelle ne constitue pas la crainte de persécution. Dans ces circonstances je ne peux intervenir.\n[30]\nDans l'arrêt Chan, ci-dessus, la Cour suprême du Canada a réitéré qu'un revendicateur de statut a le fardeau de démontrer l'existence d'une crainte bien fondée de persécution. Cette crainte comporte à la fois un élément subjectif et objectif et seule l'existence de ces deux éléments permet de conclure qu'une possibilité sérieuse de persécution s'y rattache.\n[31]\nÀ ce sujet, Madame la juge Tremblay-Lamer a dit ce qui suit dans l'arrêt  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 10:\nL'absence de preuve quant à l'élément subjectif de la revendication constitue une lacune fatale qui justifie à elle seule le rejet de la revendication puisque les deux éléments de la définition de réfugié, subjectif et objectif, doivent être rencontrés.\n[32]\nConséquemment, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille n'ont pas établi qu'ils avaient une crainte subjective de persécution advenant leur retour en Uruguay. L'absence d'une crainte subjective de persécution implique que la Commission n'a pas à rechercher le fondement objectif de la crainte alléguée sur la base d'une quelconque preuve documentaire indépendante.\nProtection de l'État\n[33]\nLa Commission était préoccupée par le fait que monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille n'ont pas attendu que le processus judiciaire initié par les autorités judiciaires soit terminé. Ils ont décidé de quitter leur pays et monsieur Modernell Gilgorri n'a pas témoigné au procès d'Alejandro Fernandez, qui avait été arrêté et détenu suite à la plainte de monsieur Modernell Gilgorri.\n[34]\nIl est important de se rappeler le principe établi dans l'arrêt Canada (Procureur général) c. Ward, [1993] 2 R.C.S. 689, [1993] A.C.S. no 74 (QL), au paragraphe 50, soit que la preuve doit être claire et convaincante pour renverser la présomption qu'un État est capable d'assurer la protection de ses ressortissants :\nIl s'agit donc de savoir comment, en pratique, un demandeur arrive à prouver l'incapacité de l'État de protéger ses ressortissants et le caractère raisonnable de son refus de solliciter réellement cette protection. D'après les faits de l'espèce, il n'était pas nécessaire de prouver ce point car les représentants des autorités de l'État ont reconnu leur incapacité de protéger Ward. Toutefois, en l'absence de pareil aveu, il faut confirmer d'une façon claire et convaincante l'incapacité de l'État d'assurer la protection. Par exemple, un demandeur pourrait présenter le témoignage de personnes [page725] qui sont dans une situation semblable à la sienne et que les dispositions prises par l'État pour les protéger n'ont pas aidées, ou son propre témoignage au sujet d'incidents personnels antérieurs au cours desquels la protection de l'État ne s'est pas concrétisée. En l'absence d'une preuve quelconque, la revendication devrait échouer, car il y a lieu de présumer que les nations sont capables de protéger leurs citoyens. La sécurité des ressortissants constitue, après tout, l'essence de la souveraineté. En l'absence d'un effondrement complet de l'appareil étatique, comme celui qui a été reconnu au Liban dans l'arrêt Zalzali, il y a lieu de présumer que l'État est capable de protéger le demandeur.\n[35]\nDe plus, la Cour d'appel a déjà déclaré qu'aucun pays ne peut offrir une garantie de protection de tous ses citoyens en tout temps :\nAucun gouvernement qui professe des valeurs démocratiques ou affirme son respect des droits de la personne ne peut garantir la protection de chacun de ses citoyens en tout temps. [...] Par contre, lorsqu'un état a le contrôle efficient de son territoire, qu'il possède des autorités militaires et civiles et une force policière établies, et qu'il fait de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens contre les activités terroristes, le seul fait qu'il n'y réussit pas toujours ne suffit pas à justifier la prétention que les victimes du terrorisme ne peuvent pas se réclamer de sa protection.\n(Canada (Ministre de l'Emploi et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), au paragraphe 7)\n[36]\nMonsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille n'ont pas rencontré leur fardeau de preuve pour démontrer qu'ils ne bénéficiaient pas de la protection de leur État.\n[37]\nLes conclusions tirées par la Commission s'infèrent raisonnablement de la preuve présentée. La présomption voulant que la Commission ait tenu compte de l'ensemble de la preuve pour conclure que monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille ne sont pas des réfugiés au sens de la Convention ni des personnes à protéger s'applique en l'espèce. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )\nRefuge interne\n[38]\nLors qu'il existe une possibilité de refuge interne, il n'est pas nécessaire de déterminer si un revendicateur peut ou veut obtenir la protection de l'État. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL); Urgel, ci-dessus au paragraphe 14)\n[39]\nIl appartient au revendicateur de démontrer qu'il existe un risque sérieux de persécution dans tout le pays, donc qu'il n'existe aucune possibilité de refuge interne. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] A.C.F. no 1747 (QL), au paragraphe 17; E.H.S., ci-dessus, aux paragraphes 13-14)\n[40]\nDans E.H.S., ci-dessus, au paragraphe 12, le juge Pierre Blais énonce le test pour déterminer s'il existe une possibilité de refuge interne :\nLa Cour d'appel fédérale a développé un test à deux volets pour déterminer si quelqu'un qui réclame le statut de réfugié a un PRI dans un autre endroit de son pays. Le test a été réitéré clairement par le juge Beaudry dans l'arrêt Dillon c. (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'immigration), [2005] A.C.F. no 463, au paragraphe 11 :\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) paragraphe 2, la Cour d'appel fédérale a mentionné deux éléments à être considérés lorsqu'il s'agit d'établir une PRI : la Commission doit être convaincue selon la prépondérance des probabilités que le demandeur ne risque pas sérieusement d'être persécuté à l'endroit proposé comme PRI, et compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, dont celles propres au demandeur, la situation à l'endroit proposé est telle qu'il n'est pas déraisonnable pour le demandeur d'y chercher refuge.\n[41]\nEn l'espèce, la Commission a déterminé qu'il existe une possibilité de refuge interne en Uruguay. Lorsque monsieur Modernell Gilgorri a été questionné à ce sujet, il a dit que l'État était trop petit pour lui permettre d'être en sécurité ailleurs et qu'il n'avait pas assez d'argent pour déménager ailleurs dans le pays. Il a aussi dit qu'il n'avait pas envisagé la possibilité de déménager ailleurs.\n[42]\nMonsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille n'ont pas démontré à la Commission qu'ils étaient à risque de persécution partout à travers l'Uruguay. Ils n'ont pas démontré qu'il leur serait déraisonnable d'aller ailleurs en Uruguay pour y chercher refuge. Il était donc raisonnable pour la Commission de conclure qu'il existe une possibilité de refuge interne et donc, qu'il n'était pas justifié d'accorder la protection à monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille.\nCONCLUSION\n[43]\nCompte tenu de ce qui précède, monsieur Modernell Gilgorri et sa famille n'ont pas fait la preuve que la Commission a commis une erreur de droit ou une erreur dans l'appréciation des faits qui serait manifestement déraisonnable et qui justifierait l'intervention de cette Cour. Cette demande de contrôle judiciaire est donc rejetée.\nJUGEMENT\n[44]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée;\n2. Aucune question grave de portée générale soit certifiée.\n.........................\nRuben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a refugee claimant has the burden of establishing that a well-founded fear of persecution exists. This fear has an element that is both subjective and objective and only the existence of both of these elements supports a determination that there is a serious possibility of persecution:\nBoth the existence of the subjective fear and the fact that the fear is objectively well-founded must be established on a balance of probabilities. In the specific context of refugee determination, it has been established by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the claimant need not prove that persecution would be more likely than not in order to meet the objective portion of the test. The claimant must establish, however, that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution. The applicable test has been expressed as a reasonable possibility or, more appropriately in my view, as a serious possibility.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\nNATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING\n[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (Act) of the decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) dated August 18, 2005, that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\nFACTS\n[3]\nThe applicants, Ruben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, his wife Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron, and their son Brian Dario Modernell Rodriguez, are citizens of Uruguay. The familys application is based on Mr. Modernell Gilgorris story.\n[4]\nMs. Rodriguez Padron worked for a few years in a pharmacy while Mr. Modernell Gilgorri, after having studied in electricity, was a self-employed electrician and sold various products.\n[5]\nIn mid-December 2002, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was elected as a member of the local Community Centre Management. Shortly thereafter, he noticed that members of the executive committee were appropriating funds meant for the community. In February 2003, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri reported this misappropriation of funds. Mr. Modernell Gilgorri alleges that three individuals attacked him, but he did not file a police report because he was not able to identify his attackers.\n[6]\nAfter this attack, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri stopped attending the Executive Committee meetings but he continued his community work with the underprivileged population of his neighbourhood.\n[7]\nIn December 2003, at the general assembly of the Community Centre Management, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri condemned the misappropriation of funds. Several individuals demanded the resignation of the members of the Executive Committee who were, according to Mr. Modernell Gilgorri, members of the Uruguayan Communist Party.\n[8]\nThen, in April 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri met Alejandro Fernandez, a former member of the Executive Committee, who pointed out that he had not forgotten him.\n[9]\nIn May 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was assaulted by four individuals when he was returning home at night. He filed a police report. Following the complaint and the police investigation, Alejandro Fernandez was arrested and detained for assaulting Mr. Modernell Gilgorri.\n[10]\nNearing the end of May and the beginning of June 2004, Rodriguez Padron was assaulted and their son was threatened repeatedly. In September 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was threatened in turn; he was told that he would be killed if he did not withdraw the charges.\n[11]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri then decided to leave the country with his family. They left Uruguay on October 28, 2004, by bus bound for Canada through Argentine, Chili, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa-Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and finally the United States. They crossed the Lacolle border on November 24, 2004, and claimed protection from Canada.\nIMPUGNED DECISION\n[12]\nThe Board determined that they were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection since it did not see a connection with the Convention and since Mr. Modernell Gilgorri did not wait for the Uruguayan police and judicial authorities to do their job.\n[13]\nThe Board determined that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family are rather faced with a fear of personal vengeance. It is more a problem of local crime than an issue of persecution. The Board is of the opinion that the authorities acted in accordance with the norms, i.e. that they investigated and brought Alejandro Fernandez to trial following Mr. Modernell Gilgorri s complaint.\n[14]\nThe Board doubted the validity of the fear of Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family. It found that their conduct was inconsistent with the conduct of reasonable persons having a fear of persecution and seeking international protection. In fact, they travelled through 12 countries before arriving in Canada but did not seek protection in any of those countries.\nISSUES\n[15]\nThe parties raised the following issues:\n1. Did the Board err in determining that the principal applicant was not credible with respect to the alleged fear of persecution?\n2. Did the Board err in determining that the applicants did not meet their burden of proof of establishing that they could not benefit from the protection of the State of Uruguay?\n3. Did the Board err in determining that the applicants had an internal flight alternative?\nANALYSIS\nStandard of review\n[16]\nWith its expertise, the Board is the tribunal in the best position to weigh the facts, particularly when it is a matter of assessing the witnesses credibility and the evidence filed with regard to the definition of Convention refugee.\nThere is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 4)\n[17]\nThis Court has on numerous occasions reiterated that the principle of patent unreasonableness applies to decisions by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 9-15;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 8-9;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 10-11;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n[18]\nThe Board has a well-established expertise with regard to assessing the facts, particularly in assessing the credibility of refugee claimants and the availability of protection offered by the country of origin ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n[19]\nThe question of whether there is an internal flight alternative is itself also a question of fact. The standard of review is therefore that of patent unreasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1263 (QL), at paragraphs 9-10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1606 (QL), at paragraph 10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 2171 (QL), at paragraph 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 463 (QL), at paragraph 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1912 (QL), at paragraph 18).\nCredibility and fear of persecution\n[20]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri alleges that he fears that Alejandro Fernandez, member of the Uruguayan Communist Party and former member of the local community centre, will persecute him. Mr. Modernell Gilgorri says that he fears him because of his political beliefs and because he reported him to the police which led to his arrest, charges and a trial.\n[21]\nApart from fleeing Uruguay because of Fernandezs threats, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri pointed out at the hearing that his goal was to come to Canada in order to escape the misery existing in his own country.\n[22]\nIn this matter, the Boards determination can be inferred reasonably from the evidence. The simple fact that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family interpret the evidence differently does not at all establish that the Board made a determinative error in its own interpretation of the evidence or in the inferences that it made therefrom.\n[23]\nFurther, the Board made a negative finding with respect to the conduct of Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family, which was incompatible with the conduct of persons having a well-founded fear of persecution. The Board points out that they left Uruguay for Canada via 12 South American, Central American and North American countries. They did not claim protection from any of these countries.\n[24]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 2, Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay states the following:\nThe basis of that conclusion was that his conduct subsequent to leaving Romania in July 1992 was inconsistent with a fear of persecution and his delay in claiming refugee status until he arrived in Canada in February 1993 negated a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[25]\nSimilarly, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 14, Mr. Justice Max Teitelbaum states as follows:\n. . . Failure to immediately seek protection can impugn the claimant's credibility, including his or her testimony about events in his country of origin . . .\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 7 and 12, Mr. Justice Francis Muldoon writes the following:\n. . . One might observe that he passed through Amsterdam and that The Netherlands is a convention refugee signatory, but apparently he did not think to claim refugee status there.\n. . .\n. . . Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\n[27]\nReferring to several other decisions bearing on this very subject, Mr. Justice Edmond Blanchard states, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 27:\n. . .The fact of passing through a country which is a signatory of the Convention without claiming refugee status as quickly as possible may be one factor in assessing the subjective aspects of her claim.\n[28]\nThe Board was entitled to determine that it was a fear characterized by Alejandro Fernandezs need for personal vengeance. In other words, the alleged fear of persecution is not related to the grounds listed in the Convention. Personal vengeance has no connection with grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, which are the grounds set out in the definition of Convention refugee.\n[29]\nThis principle was established inter alia by Madam Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):\nIn view of the facts in the record the panel could have concluded as it did that the fear mentioned by the applicant was not connected to any of the five grounds listed in the definition of a Convention refugee. The fear of personal vengeance is not a fear of persecution. In these circumstances, I cannot intervene.\n[30]\nIn  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a refugee claimant has the burden of establishing the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution. This fear has a subjective and objective element, and a serious possibility of persecution can be found only where both of these elements exist.\n[31]\nOn that point, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer said the following in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 10:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definitionsubjective and objectivemust be met.\n[32]\nAccordingly, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that they had a subjective fear of persecution if they were to return to Uruguay. The lack of a subjective fear of persecution signifies that the Board need not identify the objective basis of the alleged fear based on any independent documentary evidence.\nState protection\n[33]\nThe Board was preoccupied by the fact that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not wait for the judicial process initiated by the judicial authorities to be completed. They decided to leave their country and Mr. Modernell Gilgorri did not testify at the trial of Alejandro Fernandez, who was arrested and detained following Mr. Modernell Gilgorris report to the police.\n[34]\nIt is important to remember the principle established in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 50, namely that the evidence must be clear and convincing to rebut the presumption that a State is able to guarantee the protection of its nationals:\nThere is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden.\n[35]\nFurther, the Court of Appeal has already stated that no country can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. . . . On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\n(Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 7)\n[36]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not meet their burden of proof of establishing that they were not being protected by their State.\n[37]\nThe determinations made by the Board can reasonably be inferred from the evidence filed. The presumption to the effect that the Board considered all of the evidence in determining that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection is applicable in this case ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nInternal flight alternative\n[38]\nWhen there is an internal flight alternative, it is not necessary to determine whether a claimant is able or willing to obtain protection from the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 14).\n[39]\nIt is the claimants responsibility to establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution in the entire country, therefore that there is no internal flight alternative ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1747 (QL), at paragraph 17; E.H.S., supra, at paragraphs 13-14).\n[40]\nIn E.H.S., supra, at paragraph 12, Mr. Justice Pierre Blais sets out the test for determining whether there is an internal flight alternative:\nThe Federal Court of Appeal developed a two-part test to determine whether a person claiming refugee status has an IFA in another part of their country. The test was clearly reiterated by Beaudry J.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  v. (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 463, at paragraph 11:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) at paragraph 2, the Federal Court of Appeal listed two elements to be considered when establishing an IFA: the Board must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists, and, taking into account all the circumstances, including those specific to the applicant, the situation in the proposed location must be such that it would not be unreasonable for the applicant to seek shelter there.\n[41]\nIn this case, the Board determined that there was an internal flight alternative in Uruguay. When Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was questioned on that point, he said that the State was too small for him to find safety elsewhere and that he did not have enough money to move elsewhere in the country. He also said that he had not considered the possibility of moving elsewhere.\n[42]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not show the Board that they were at risk of being persecuted everywhere across Uruguay. They did not establish that it would be unreasonable for them to go elsewhere in Uruguay to seek refuge. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to determine that there was an internal flight alternative and therefore that it was not justified in granting protection to Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family.\nCONCLUSION\n[43]\nConsidering the foregoing, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that the Board made a patently unreasonable error in law or in assessing the facts that would justify the intervention of this Court. This application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n[44]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that:\n1. The application for judicial review be dismissed.\n2. No serious question of general importance be certified.\n[End of document]",

This fear includes both a subjective and objective element and only the existence of these two elements allows us to conclude that a serious possibility of persecution is attached to it:\nBoth the existence of a subjective fear and the objective basis of this fear must be established on the balance of probabilities. [...] The applicable test has been described as the existence of a reasonable possibility or, more aptly in my opinion, a serious possibility.\n(<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (QL))\nNATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEDURE\nE\n\n[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (Act) of the decision by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) dated August 18, 2005, that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\nFACTS\n\n[3]\nThe applicants, Ruben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, his wife Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron, and their son Brian Dario Modernell Rodriguez, are citizens of Uruguay. The familys application is based on Mr. Modernell Gilgorris story.\n\n[4]\nMs. Rodriguez Padron worked for a few years in a pharmacy while Mr. Modernell Gilgorri, after having studied in electricity, was a self-employed electrician and sold various products.\n\n[5]\nIn mid-December 2002, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was elected as a member of the local Community Centre Management. Shortly thereafter, he noticed that members of the executive committee were appropriating funds meant for the community. In February 2003, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri reported this misappropriation of funds. Mr. Modernell Gilgorri alleges that three individuals attacked him, but he did not file a police report because he was not able to identify his attackers.\n\n[6]\nAfter this attack, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri stopped attending the Executive Committee meetings but he continued his community work with the underprivileged population of his neighbourhood.\n\n[7]\nIn December 2003, at the general assembly of the Community Centre Management, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri condemned the misappropriation of funds.

He filed a police report.

In September 2004, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was threatened in turn; he was told that he would be killed if he did not withdraw the charges.\n\n[11]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri then decided to leave the country with his family. They left Uruguay on October 28, 2004, by bus bound for Canada through Argentine, Chili, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa-Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and finally the United States. They crossed the Lacolle border on November 24, 2004, and claimed protection from Canada.\nIMPUGNED DECISION\n\n[12]\nThe Board determined that they were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection since it did not see a connection with the Convention and since Mr. Modernell Gilgorri did not wait for the Uruguayan police and judicial authorities to do their job.\n\n[13]\nThe Board determined that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family are rather faced with a fear of personal vengeance. It is more a problem of local crime than an issue of persecution. The Board is of the opinion that the authorities acted in accordance with the norms, i.e. that they investigated and brought Alejandro Fernandez to trial following Mr. Modernell Gilgorri s complaint.\n\n[14]\nThe Board doubted the validity of the fear of Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family. It found that their conduct was inconsistent with the conduct of reasonable persons having a fear of persecution and seeking international protection. In fact, they travelled through 12 countries before arriving in Canada but did not seek protection in any of those countries.\nISSUES\n\n[15]\nThe parties raised the following issues:\n1. Did the Board err in determining that the principal applicant was not credible with respect to the alleged fear of persecution?\n2. Did the Board err in determining that the applicants did not meet their burden of proof of establishing that they could not benefit from the protection of the State of Uruguay?\n3. Did the Board err in determining that the applicants had an internal flight alternative?\nANALYSIS\nStandard of review\n\n[16]\nWith its expertise, the Board is the tribunal in the best position to weigh the facts, particularly when it is a matter of assessing the witnesses credibility and the evidence filed with regard to the definition of Convention refugee.\nThere is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 4)\n\n[17]\nThis Court has on numerous occasions reiterated that the principle of patent unreasonableness applies to decisions by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 9-15;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 8-9;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 10-11;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n\n[18]\nThe Board has a well-established expertise with regard to assessing the facts, particularly in assessing the credibility of refugee claimants and the availability of protection offered by the country of origin ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\n\n[19]\nThe question of whether there is an internal flight alternative is itself also a question of fact. The standard of review is therefore that of patent unreasonableness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1263 (QL), at paragraphs 9-10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1606 (QL), at paragraph 10;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 2171 (QL), at paragraph 13;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 463 (QL), at paragraph 7;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1912 (QL), at paragraph 18).\nCredibility and fear of persecution\n\n[20]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri alleges that he fears that Alejandro Fernandez, member of the Uruguayan Communist Party and former member of the local community centre, will persecute him. Mr. Modernell Gilgorri says that he fears him because of his political beliefs and because he reported him to the police which led to his arrest, charges and a trial.\n\n[21]\nApart from fleeing Uruguay because of Fernandezs threats, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri pointed out at the hearing that his goal was to come to Canada in order to escape the misery existing in his own country.\n\n[22]\nIn this matter, the Boards determination can be inferred reasonably from the evidence. The simple fact that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family interpret the evidence differently does not at all establish that the Board made a determinative error in its own interpretation of the evidence or in the inferences that it made therefrom.\n\n[23]\nFurther, the Board made a negative finding with respect to the conduct of Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family, which was incompatible with the conduct of persons having a well-founded fear of persecution. The Board points out that they left Uruguay for Canada via 12 South American, Central American and North American countries. They did not claim protection from any of these countries.\n\n[24]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 2, Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay states the following:\nThe basis of that conclusion was that his conduct subsequent to leaving Romania in July 1992 was inconsistent with a fear of persecution and his delay in claiming refugee status until he arrived in Canada in February 1993 negated a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\n[25]\nSimilarly, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 14, Mr. Justice Max Teitelbaum states as follows:\n. . . Failure to immediately seek protection can impugn the claimant's credibility, including his or her testimony about events in his country of origin . . .\n\n[26]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraphs 7 and 12, Mr. Justice Francis Muldoon writes the following:\n. . . One might observe that he passed through Amsterdam and that The Netherlands is a convention refugee signatory, but apparently he did not think to claim refugee status there.\n. . .\n. . . Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\n\n[27]\nReferring to several other decisions bearing on this very subject, Mr. Justice Edmond Blanchard states, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 27:\n. . .The fact of passing through a country which is a signatory of the Convention without claiming refugee status as quickly as possible may be one factor in assessing the subjective aspects of her claim.\n\n[28]\nThe Board was entitled to determine that it was a fear characterized by Alejandro Fernandezs need for personal vengeance. In other words, the alleged fear of persecution is not related to the grounds listed in the Convention. Personal vengeance has no connection with grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, which are the grounds set out in the definition of Convention refugee.\n\n[29]\nThis principle was established inter alia by Madam Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL):\nIn view of the facts in the record the panel could have concluded as it did that the fear mentioned by the applicant was not connected to any of the five grounds listed in the definition of a Convention refugee. The fear of personal vengeance is not a fear of persecution. In these circumstances, I cannot intervene.\n\n[30]\nIn  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a refugee claimant has the burden of establishing the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution. This fear has a subjective and objective element, and a serious possibility of persecution can be found only where both of these elements exist.\n\n[31]\nOn that point, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer said the following in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 10:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definitionsubjective and objectivemust be met.\n\n[32]\nAccordingly, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that they had a subjective fear of persecution if they were to return to Uruguay. The lack of a subjective fear of persecution signifies that the Board need not identify the objective basis of the alleged fear based on any independent documentary evidence.\nState protection\n\n[33]\nThe Board was preoccupied by the fact that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not wait for the judicial process initiated by the judicial authorities to be completed. They decided to leave their country and Mr. Modernell Gilgorri did not testify at the trial of Alejandro Fernandez, who was arrested and detained following Mr. Modernell Gilgorris report to the police.\n\n[34]\nIt is important to remember the principle established in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 50, namely that the evidence must be clear and convincing to rebut the presumption that a State is able to guarantee the protection of its nationals:\nThere is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden.\n\n[35]\nFurther, the Court of Appeal has already stated that no country can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. . . . On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\n(Canada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at paragraph 7)\n\n[36]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not meet their burden of proof of establishing that they were not being protected by their State.\n\n[37]\nThe determinations made by the Board can reasonably be inferred from the evidence filed. The presumption to the effect that the Board considered all of the evidence in determining that Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection is applicable in this case ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nInternal flight alternative\n\n[38]\nWhen there is an internal flight alternative, it is not necessary to determine whether a claimant is able or willing to obtain protection from the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 14).\n\n[39]\nIt is the claimants responsibility to establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution in the entire country, therefore that there is no internal flight alternative ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1747 (QL), at paragraph 17; E.H.S., supra, at paragraphs 13-14).\n\n[40]\nIn E.H.S., supra, at paragraph 12, Mr. Justice Pierre Blais sets out the test for determining whether there is an internal flight alternative:\nThe Federal Court of Appeal developed a two-part test to determine whether a person claiming refugee status has an IFA in another part of their country. The test was clearly reiterated by Beaudry J.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  v. (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 463, at paragraph 11:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) at paragraph 2, the Federal Court of Appeal listed two elements to be considered when establishing an IFA: the Board must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists, and, taking into account all the circumstances, including those specific to the applicant, the situation in the proposed location must be such that it would not be unreasonable for the applicant to seek shelter there.\n\n[41]\nIn this case, the Board determined that there was an internal flight alternative in Uruguay. When Mr. Modernell Gilgorri was questioned on that point, he said that the State was too small for him to find safety elsewhere and that he did not have enough money to move elsewhere in the country. He also said that he had not considered the possibility of moving elsewhere.\n\n[42]\nMr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not show the Board that they were at risk of being persecuted everywhere across Uruguay. They did not establish that it would be unreasonable for them to go elsewhere in Uruguay to seek refuge. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to determine that there was an internal flight alternative and therefore that it was not justified in granting protection to Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[43]\nConsidering the foregoing, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that the Board made a patently unreasonable error in law or in assessing the facts that would justify the intervention of this Court. This application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[44]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée;\n2. Aucune question grave de portée générale soit certifiée.\n.........................\nRuben Dario Modernell Gilgorri, Ana Laura Rodriguez Padron and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that a refugee claimant has the burden of establishing that a well-founded fear of persecution exists. This fear has an element that is both subjective and objective and only the existence of both of these elements supports a determination that there is a serious possibility of persecution:\nBoth the existence of the subjective fear and the fact that the fear is objectively well-founded must be established on a balance of probabilities. In the specific context of refugee determination, it has been established by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the claimant need not prove that persecution would be more likely than not in order to meet the objective portion of the test. The claimant must establish, however, that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution. The applicable test has been expressed as a reasonable possibility or, more appropriately in my view, as a serious possibility.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)).\nNATURE OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING",
