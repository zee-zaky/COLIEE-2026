    "[1]\nStrayer, J.\n: This is an action for infringement of the plaintiff's Canadian patent 1,193,508 issued September 17, 1985 with respect to a \"smooth bore double lumen catheter\". The disclosures of the patent describe a use of this catheter in hemodialysis (the removal of blood from a patient suffering a kidney dysfunction, the cleansing and return of that blood) by means of insertion of the catheter into a large vein. The catheter, having two \"lumens\" or passages in it, carries away from the vein through one passage blood containing toxins, and returns to that vein through the other passage the cleansed blood once it has passed through a dialysis machine. Reproduced on p. 51 are the drawings from the patent in issue. In figure 1 can be seen, at the proximal end of the catheter, tube 17 which carries away the soiled blood from the catheter, and tube 16 which returns the clean blood from the dialysis machine.\nDRAWING OF DEFENDANTS' PRODUCT\n[Diagram omitted. See printed volume.]\nDRAWING FROM PATENT IN ISSUE\n[Diagram omitted. See printed volume.]",
    "[2]\nThe plaintiff is a physician employed by the Division of Nephrology in the Department of Medicine, Cook County Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, and an Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Chicago Medical School.",
    "[3]\nAccording to the statement of agreed facts, the defendant Vas-Cath is an Ontario corporation which manufactures and sells in Canada double lumen catheters known as VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000. Reproduced below are some drawings from a patent application filed by the defendant Vas-Cath on May 24, 1984.",
    "[4]\nAccording to Geoffrey S. Martin, President and 50% owner of Vas-Cath who was its representative at the examination for discovery held on November 13, 1986, the intent was that such drawings should cover the catheters then being manufactured by Vas-Cath. Subsequent to that examination for discovery, in March, 1987 Vas-Cath made some changes to the design of the VACCESS 3500 and of the VACCESS 4000. The only material alteration is described in a continuation of the examination for discovery held on November 20, 1987 and is marked on trial Exhibit P-29. The relevant change as indicated by Mr. Martin involves a gap or a space in the material marked as 56 and 58 in figure 3 above, the gap commencing at about midway between the numbers 56 and 46 and ending slightly to the right of the number 5 all as they appear in figure 3. It was also agreed in the statement of agreed facts that the defendant Gambro Canada Ltd. is the exclusive distributor for this kind of product of Vas-Cath throughout the world except in the U.S.A. It was further agreed that Vas-Cath has been manufacturing and selling in Canada the VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 double lumen catheters without any licence from the plaintiff and intends to continue to do so, and that Gambro has similarly distributed these catheters in Canada and intends to continue to do so.",
    "[5]\nThe defendants deny infringement, and as is usual in such cases deny the validity of the plaintiff's patent 1,193,508. They attack the validity on the grounds that the plaintiff is not the first inventor and that before the plaintiff applied for his patent (the priority date being August 15, 1984 the date of application for the corresponding U.S. patent) products embodying the same alleged invention had been made available to the public; that the plaintiff's application should have been rejected under s. 63(2) of the Patent Act because the defendant Vas-Cath had already obtained Canadian patent number 1,167,727 issued on May 22, 1984 for the same invention; that the plaintiff's invention had been anticipated by an earlier patent; that it was obvious having regard to the prior art; that it does not comply with the requirements of s. 36(1) of the Patent Act; and that the claims are wider than the invention disclosed.",
    "[6]\nPursuant to an order of this court made on November 18, 1986 any assessment of damages or profits arising from infringement is to be the subject of a reference under rule 500, should I find liability. I therefore need not deal with questions of quantum.\nInfringement",
    "[7]\nI have concluded that the catheters VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 sold by the defendants infringe at least certain of the claims of the plaintiff's patent. I find infringement of claims 7, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Claims 11, 20, and 26 are not in issue.",
    "[8]\nThe reasons for which I find infringement of these claims are well illustrated in Exhibit P11-38, part of the affidavit of the plaintiff testifying as an expert. He displays there side by side the drawings which Vas-Cath admits depict their product and the text of the claims, demonstrating by arrows where the various features described in the claims can be found in the drawing. I have reviewed this material and accept it as demonstrating infringement of the claims to which I have referred.",
    "[9]\nThe principal contention of the defendants with respect to infringement has been that their product does not involve a \"relative concentration of material extending axially from the second opening to the distal end of said cylindrical tube ...\" as referred to in claims 7 and 14. In figure 7 of the patent in issue, reproduced above, this \"concentration of material\" is depicted at 23. The defendants contend that as so described in the patent, it can refer only to material which is derived from the double lumen tubing itself or from a projection from a separate tip inserted into the second (shorter) lumen. By contrast, they point out (and this is not disputed) that their catheters use a separate plug of the same material as the lumens, the plug being inserted into the second lumen prior to formation of the tip, it appearing in figure 3 of the drawing of their product reproduced above as 56 and 58. Further, they point out that in the revised models of their catheters produced since March of 1987 there is a shorter plug blocking off the second lumen, then going toward the tip an open space (part of the original second lumen), and then solid material where the second lumen used to be, caused by the forming of the tip. Thus they contend that there is no \"relative concentration of material as contemplated by claim 14. I find this contention unconvincing. First, I believe that there is textual infringement of the patent because the words \"relative concentration of material\" in their normal usage do not as such imply the source of the \"material\". I see no reason why the \"material\" may not come from an extraneous source and be added to the material of the lumens to increase the \"concentration\" in a certain area. There was no expert evidence which clearly indicated to me why the ordinary meaning of the words should not apply in this case. In any event I am satisfied that there is substantive infringement by the defendants' catheters even though they insert a plug in one lumen to strengthen the tip instead of providing such thickening through integral moulding of the material already in the dual lumen tubing. As stated recently by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords [see footnote 1], a court should in interpreting a claim give it a \"purposive construction\" and not interpret it to exclude minor variants which to the knowledge of the inventor and the readers of the patent could have no material effect upon the way in which the invention works. That approach is clearly applicable here. It is clear from the evidence that the purpose of the \"relative concentration of material\" is to strengthen the tip of the catheter so that it will not bend unduly while being pushed through human tissue. The evidence satisfies me that this purpose would be evident to any one skilled in the art in reading the patent. To the achievement of this purpose, no one has demonstrated to me what possible difference it could make whether the concentration of material is integrally formed from the dual lumen tubing or whether it is provided by similar material in the form of a plug inserted into one of the lumens. There was evidence that when, so inserted, heat is applied, the effect is to meld the plug with the surrounding material. This surely results in a concentration of material in the area where the plug was placed. More importantly, the purpose of using this technique, and its net effect, is the same as if the extra material had been found in the tubing itself through melting and compaction of extra tubing material at the tip end. The use of a plug is a mere detail which does not save the defendants from infringement of the patent [see footnote 2]. For the same reasons, the innovation of a gap in the plug area as found in the new models of VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 produced since March, 1987 does not save those devices from infringing. Expert witnesses including Dr. Robert Uldall and Mr. Glen Beall testified that this variation would make no functional difference to the catheter. I am therefore satisfied that it also infringes in substance the plaintiff's patent.",
    "[10]\nThe defendants also contended that there was no infringement of claim 17 because it describes a catheter as claimed in claim 14:\n\"... wherein the first opening in the distal end of said cylindrical tube is eccentric with respect to the axis of the conical tapered tip.\"\n\"Eccentric\" is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as describing something which is \"not centrally placed\" or whose axis is not centrally placed. I therefore understand this claim to describe a tip in which the opening for the entry to the first lumen is off center of the tip. The defendants contend, and this appears to be the case, that the lumen opening in their tips is centered. For this reason I am not finding any infringement with claim 17, but this does not mean that the defendants have not infringed the other claims to which I have referred. At best, the precise location of the hole in the end of the tip is a minor variation which, as I understand the evidence, can have no serious effect on the way the catheter operates. A more general and important claim is claim 15 which requires that:\n\"... the apex of said conical tip is substantially aligned with the axis of said cylindrical tube.\"\nIn other words, this claim requires that the tip be essentially in the center point of the tube. According to the evidence this will facilitate insertion through human tissue. It is only within the diameter of that tip that the opening hold could be either centered or eccentric to the axis of the tube. Such variations must, by their nature, be minuscule and there was no evidence that a centered or eccentric position of the opening in the end of the conical tip would significantly affect the insertion of the catheter over a wire in accordance with the Seldinger technique. Claim 15 aptly describes the configuration of the defendants' products. The fact that they have not adopted the variation described in claim 17 does not exempt them from liability for infringement as they have appropriated the substance of the plaintiff's patent as set out in the claims to which I have referred.",
    "[11]\nAs will be explained below, I have found the remaining claims to be invalid and therefore will not analyze whether any of them are infringed by the defendants' products.\nPriority of Invention",
    "[12]\nI have concluded that the plaintiff, Doctor Mahurkar, was the inventor of the dual lumen subclavian catheter as described in the patent in issue and that he was therefore the first person to know of or use it. I find the following to be the salient facts. In 1977 Dr. Mahurkar had applied for, and on January 16, 1979 had obtained, U.S. patent 4,134,402 for a \"double lumen hemodialysis catheter\". This was actually a double lumen rigid needle, cylindrical in shape but divided internally by a septum which created two equal-sized \"D\"-shaped or semi-circular lumens for carrying away and returning blood. This needle would, as I understand it, normally be used for hemodialysis through insertion into a fistula, probably in the arm or leg. The needle did not have a tapered tip. The tip was bevelled, with one lumen continuing to the tip and the other lumen being cut away some distance back from the tip with its end open at that point. In the summer of 1979 Dr. Mahurkar conceived the idea of a plastic double lumen catheter and started to seek appropriate tubing from manufacturers. He finally obtained some suitable samples from Teal Plastics Inc. of Baraboo, Wisconsin. On December 22, 1980 he ordered a quantity of such double lumen extrusion from the company. In January of 1981 through experimentation at his home in Chicago in the development of a suitable tip for such tubing, he produced a few tapered tips which are now Exhibits P11-16. In April, 1981 and in approximately June, 1981 he had conversations with Mr. Wayne Quinton, Chairman of the Board of Quinton Instrument Company of Seattle, Washington. Mr. Quinton, whose company makes various medical products, was interested in the idea of dual lumen catheters for hemodialysis and he was intrigued by Dr. Mahurkar's dual lumen needle as covered by the U.S. '402 patent. While in his evidence he was somewhat unsure as to when Dr. Mahurkar first showed him the dual lumen tubing with tapered tips which are now Exhibits P11-16, it seems clear from the events that followed that this happened either in these meetings of April and June or in the subsequent months of 1981 when discussions were going on between Mr. Quinton and Dr. Mahurkar which culminated in a licence agreement being signed on February 1, 1982. (See Exhibit P-2, page 123 ff.) This licence agreement refers only to U.S. patent '402 but involved the obtaining, and grant, of a licence from Dr. Mahurkar to Quinton Instrument Company of the right to manufacture, use, sell and distribute, inter alia, a double lumen needle and a double lumen subclavian catheter. Pursuant to this agreement, the Quinton Instrument Company developed a double lumen subclavian catheter into a commercially successful product. In doing so Quinton developed a tapered tip which, though functioning the same as those subsequently depicted in the patent in issue, is fabricated separately with insertions which fit into the end of double lumen tubing to produce a product which externally is virtually identical to the catheter depicted in Canadian patent '508 (the patent in issue). A prototype of this catheter was displayed at a meeting of the American Society of Nephrology in Chicago in December, 1982. While it was not at that time ready for market it was displayed as a commercial product by Quinton at the American Society of Artificial Internal Organs meeting in Toronto in April, 1983. On both occasions it was seen by Geoffrey Martin, the President of the defendant Vas-Cath. By June, 1983 it was put on the market by Quinton under the name of the \"Mahurkar Catheter\". It continues to be sold under that name. Several million dollars (U.S.) worth of this catheter have been sold since June, 1983.",
    "[13]\nI am satisfied from the evidence that it was the work and discoveries of Dr. Mahurkar in the development of a usable dual lumen tubing and the design and placing thereon of a tapered tip which enabled the Quinton Instrument Company to put this catheter on the market. Mr. Quinton himself acknowledged that the development of the commercial product flowed from the agreement, particularly with reference to the exclusive licence granted by paragraph 1.2 with respect to a \"double lumen subclavian catheter\". He referred to the transfer, pursuant to the agreement, of inventory in the hands of Dr. Mahurkar. The company agreed under the licence agreement to refer to such products by the name of Dr. Mahurkar and it has done so with respect to its product (P-7). It advertises its product as the Mahurkar Catheter (P-8, P-9). The fact that before going into commercial production Quinton developed a separately moulded tip, rather than using an integrally moulded tip as Dr. Mahurkar did in his original prototypes, takes nothing away from Dr. Mahurkar's invention. Mr. Quinton explained in evidence that for his particular plant it was more economical to mould the tip separately when undertaking production in commercial quantities. This does not alter the fact that the design was Dr. Mahurkar's and that the \"Mahurkar Catheter\" sold by Quinton since June, 1983 incorporates the substance of Dr. Mahurkar's invention.",
    "[14]\nDr. Mahurkar subsequently applied on August 15, 1984 for a U.S. patent on a \"smooth bore double lumen catheter\" and made a counterpart Canadian application on August 28, 1984. Canadian patent 1,193,508, the patent in issue, was subsequently issued on September 17, 1985 as a result of this application.",
    "[15]\nAs the defendants have asserted that Geoffrey Martin, the President of the defendant Vas-Cath, made this invention, I will set out briefly my findings with respect to the activities of Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin commenced the Vas-Cath business in 1977 and the company was incorporated in January, 1979. From the outset Vas-Cath specialized in manufacturing catheters. Some time in 1978 Mr. Martin met Dr. Robert Uldall, the Director of Hemodialysis at Toronto Western Hospital and Associate Professor, Division of Nephrology, Toronto Western Hospital. Mr. Martin acting under Dr. Uldall's direction developed both a single lumen catheter and a double lumen catheter for dialysis. The double lumen catheter was co-axial, that is it consisted of one tube inside another. As a result of disagreements, Dr. Uldall and Vas-Cath discontinued collaboration in November, 1979. Vas-Cath continued to produce a dual lumen co-axial catheter thereafter. Dr. Mahurkar, who lives in Chicago, had heard of Vas-Cath as a commercial manufacturer of catheters and contacted that firm by telephone sometime after he developed the tips found in Exhibits P11-16, to discuss the possibility of it making some tips for him. After contacting Vas-Cath by telephone, he sent to it on April 2, 1981 some seventy pieces of his double lumen catheter tubing, these being sent \"for forming a smooth tip and bevel satisfactory for penetration test\". (See P3-6). On April 21, 1981 Vas-Cath returned to Dr. Mahurkar sixteen of these pieces of tubing, fourteen of which had tips. (See P-2, page 96). None of these tips were of the tapered design which is the subject of the patent in issue. As noted above Martin saw the prototype of the Mahurkar catheter as produced by Quinton in December, 1982. He saw it again as a product then commercially available in April, 1983. He says that he developed the catheter with the tip which Vas-Cath uses in its product during the summer and fall of 1983. The first sales of the Vas-Cath catheter of the type allegedly infringing the plaintiff's patent occurred in January, 1984. On May 24, 1984 Martin applied for a patent for his catheter, and such patent was issued on March 31, 1987. It is common ground that the claims of this Canadian patent 1,219,785 describe an invention covered by the claims of the plaintiff's patent 1,193,508.",
    "[16]\nIt will be apparent that in finding the facts as I have, I have preferred the evidence of the plaintiff to that of Mr. Martin on behalf of Vas-Cath. The evidence of the plaintiff as to the time of the invention was corroborated in important respects by documents and the evidence of other witnesses concerning his search for a manufacturer of tubing meeting his specifications, his discussions with other persons, and the course of his cooperation with Mr. Quinton leading to the production and sale of the \"Mahurkar Catheter\". On the other hand Mr. Martin says that he got the idea for such a catheter on March 21, 1978 while at Boynton Beach, Florida. In support of this contention he identified drawings on the back of Exhibit D-8 which he says he made at that time. These drawings show three possible designs for a double lumen catheter one of which appears to be similar to that of the plaintiff. I am aware of no other evidence which corroborates the date or authorship of this design. Nor was there any evidence that he developed this design into a workable product until after the Mahurkar catheter was actually on the market. I am further inclined to believe that Dr. Mahurkar was the inventor rather than Mr. Martin because Dr. Mahurkar had the requisite skills to create an appropriate design and Mr. Martin did not. In expert evidence given by both Dr. Mahurkar and Dr. Uldall it was said that the design of such a catheter requires extensive medical knowledge, particularly that related to the behaviour of blood, as well as knowledge of the technology of hypodermic needle and catheter manufacture. Dr. Mahurkar's training and experience equipped him for this task. By contrast, Mr. Martin's academic training is in music. He said on examination for discovery that with respect to medical supplies he was\n\"... self-taught by examining U.S.C.I. catheters and slicing them apart and seeing how they were put together; knowing what they were used for; and researching new types of products.\"\nWhile he no doubt has developed a certain amount of technical skill in the manufacture of catheters I have concluded, from the foregoing and other evidence, that with respect to this catheter he was more opportunist than inventor.",
    "[17]\nAs I have concluded that Dr. Mahurkar is the inventor of the invention disclosed in his patent '508, and that it was not known or used by any other person including Mr. Martin before he invented it, all of the defendants' pleas of invalidity based on paragraph 28(1)(a) and s. 63(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, must be dismissed.",
    "[18]\nIn addition, the defendants rely on s. 63(2) of the Patent Act which provides:\n\"63(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 43, an application for a patent for an invention for which a patent has already issued under this Act shall be rejected unless the applicant, within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner, commences an action to set aside the prior patent, so far as it covers the invention in question, but if such action is so commenced and diligently prosecuted, the application shall not be deemed to have been abandoned unless the applicant fails to proceed upon it within a reasonable time after the action has been finally disposed of.\"\nThey contend that since Vas-Cath had applied for a patent for a dual lumen cannula on November 26, 1981, and thereby obtained Canadian patent 1,167,727 issued May 22, 1984, there was a patent already issued for the same invention as was contained in the plaintiff's application of August 28, 1984, for the patent in issue. (Although the defendants' pleadings refer to patent 1,116,727 I assume in the context that patent 1,167,727 is intended). Thus it is contended that since the Commissioner did not fix a time within which the plaintiff as applicant for the patent should have commenced action against Vas-Cath as holder of patent '727, the plaintiff's application should have been rejected and his patent must therefore be treated as invalid. I am not satisfied from the evidence that Vas-Cath's earlier patent '727 is for the same invention as that covered by the plaintiff's subsequent patent '508. While involving the use of the same kind of dual lumen cylindrical tubing bisected internally by a septum, it does not have a smoothly tapered conical point. One lumen terminates in an opening at the distal end, but the other lumen terminates in an inclined plane closing off the second lumen before it reaches the distal end. There was insufficient evidence to satisfy me that this should be regarded as the same invention as that described in the plaintiff's patent '508. It is interesting to note, however, that as a result of the exchange of letters and materials between the plaintiff and Vas-Cath in April, 1981, Vas-Cath retained in its possession many pieces of the dual lumen tubing which the plaintiff had developed. After a meeting in Toronto on June 30, 1981, at which the plaintiff and Vas-Cath were unable to come to an agreement about the manufacture of plaintiff's catheter, the defendant Vas-Cath lost no time in seeking the patent for the kind of catheter described in its patent '727. On July 6th Mr. Martin sent instructions to his patent attorney with respect to a patent application. On July 24, 1981, Martin applied for a U.S. patent equivalent to patent '727, and the application for the Canadian patent was then made on November 26, 1981. This patent clearly utilizes the kind of dual lumen tubing developed by Dr. Mahurkar.\nAnticipation",
    "[19]\nThe defendants rely solely on the Pfarre patent, a U.S. patent issued in 1882, as anticipating the patent in issue. The Pfarre patent describes a catheter of soft rubber rounded, not tapered, at the end. It has within it two channels or lumens which are not of equal size. In one embodiment one of the lumens does lead to an opening at the distal end while the other lumen receives or discharges fluid through a hole in the side of the tube.",
    "[20]\nThe test for anticipation is very rigorous. For a prior document or patent to anticipate a patent whose validity is attacked, the former must be so clear and so apposite as inevitably to lead skilled workmen to the latter [see footnote 3]. I find that the Pfarre patent does not meet these requirements. There was no evidence that the Pfarre patent was ever implemented in a usable product and as a \"paper anticipation\" it must be viewed very strictly. The evidence from the expert witnesses was, of course, conflicting. Taking that evidence into account, and reading the two patents I am unable to conclude that the Pfarre patent would have inevitably led a skilled workman to the invention depicted in patent '508. For example, the Pfarre patent says nothing of the importance of having two D-shaped lumens of similar size. This aspect of the invention claimed is stated in claim 14 of patent '508 where it refers to \"a planar axial divider bisecting said cylindrical tube into first and second lumens ...\" Claim 7 states a similar requirement. A divider bisecting a tube must of necessity create two D-shaped lumens of similar size. The evidence has demonstrated that from the standpoint of the fluid dynamics of blood this configuration is very important. The drawing in Pfarre in fact depicts two lumens of quite unequal size. Further, the specifications say nothing as to the shape of the distal end of the catheter although the drawings depict a hemispherical end. Claim 14 of patent '508 calls for a \"smooth conical tapered tip that smoothly merges with the cylindrical surface of said cylindrical tube ...\" Claim 1 (as adopted by claim 7) has a similar requirement. It is apparent to me from the disclosures and the evidence that this is a very important feature of this catheter because of the need to insert it through the skin and into a vein, notwithstanding the evidence of one expert, Dr. Shaldon, that the difference for these purposes between a conical and hemispherical shape would be \"immaterial\". Further, claims 7 and 14 require \"a relative concentration of material\" near the tip to add rigidity for these purposes. The Pfarre patent says nothing of this requirement. Quite apart from these important differences between the actual devices, a skilled person reading it would not \"in every case and without possibility of error be led to\" [see footnote 4] the invention in issue. The whole stated purpose of Pfarre is different: it is an invention to be used for flushing out body cavities by means of insertions through existing orifices. As the specifications state:\n\"This invention is for use in washing, bathing, cooling, or warming and cleansing the bladder, stomach, ears, nose, rectum, and other diseased cavities or wounds of the human or animal body.\"\nAs the inventor states at a later point:\n\"I have experimented for some time, and have at last succeeded in producing an instrument that will be soft and easy of introduction, so that patients may be educated by their physicians to wash their bladder, stomach, &c., without pain and with ease.\"\nBy contrast, the disclosures of the patent in issue clearly show that it deals with a double lumen catheter designed for effecting the exchange of blood for purposes of hemodialysis, by means of penetration of the skin and blood vessels. Both Dr. Mahurkar and one of the defendants' witnesses, Dr. Shaldon, testifying as experts, said that Pfarre was designed for completely different purposes. The evidence satisfies me that the difference in purpose of the two devices is so material that Pfarre could not be seen as a source of clear direction for someone trying to devise a percutaneous dual lumen hemodialysis catheter. Such a connection between the two could only, I fear, be apparent to a patent agent or his computer. It is certainly curious that if this 1882 patent provided all the necessary information it took ninety-nine years for anyone to produce the kind of device depicted in the patent in issue. I appreciate, of course, that in the rarefied world of patents, such a banal observation is legally irrelevant to the question of whether an earlier patent is an anticipation of a later patent.",
    "[21]\nI therefore find that the invention in patent '508 was not anticipated by the Pfarre patent.\nObviousness",
    "[22]\nWhile obviousness may be established by demonstrating that through a variety of information available to the \"inventor\" from diverse sources the \"invention\" should have been obvious to him and therefore was not truly an \"invention\", this principle must be applied with great caution. As Hugessen, J., said on behalf of the Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy.\"\nIn the present case I am particularly mindful of his observation at page 295:\n\"Every invention is obvious after it has been made, and to no one more so than an expert in the field. Where the expert has been hired for the purpose of testifying, his infallible hindsight is even more suspect. It is so easy, once the teaching of a patent is known, to say, 'I could have done that'; before the assertion can be given any weight, one must have a satisfactory answer to the question, 'Why didn't you?'\"",
    "[23]\nWhile there was, of course, conflicting expert evidence on whether at the time Dr. Mahurkar made his invention it would have been obvious to a skilled technician in the art, I am satisfied on balance that the defendants have not met the burden of proof which lies on them to establish obviousness. I have given the most weight to the evidence of Dr. Uldall and Dr. Mahurkar. They are both medical specialists in this area who had both been engaged in the search for a device which would function for the purposes, and with the success, of the device covered by the patent in issue. Both make it clear in their evidence that there was a recognized problem - the need to have a more satisfactory dual lumen catheter to facilitate continuous hemodialysis - on which various people were working. In other words, the solution was not obvious. While Dr. Mahurkar is of course an interested party and his expert evidence must be viewed with some caution, Dr. Uldall has no interest at stake and his evidence was to the same effect. He was indeed a most persuasive witness. He is generally credited with introducing the technique of using a catheter in the subclavian vein for purposes of dialysis. He invented a single lumen catheter for this purpose and then a co-axial double lumen catheter. Before his co-axial double lumen catheter had really enjoyed wide-spread sales, however, the Mahurkar catheter as manufactured and sold by Quinton had come on the market. Dr. Uldall testified that he immediately recognized that the Mahurkar catheter was superior to his own. He said that when Dr. Mahurkar first showed him privately some of his early prototype catheters, Dr. Uldall was doubtful that they would work because he felt that the inlet holes on the side of the catheter, intended to allow the passage of blood into the inlet lumen, would become blocked by adhesion to the side of the blood vessel. In fact this proved not to be the case. He also recognized the superiority of the double-\"D\" tubing over his co-axial design but such a structure had not occurred to him for this kind of catheter. If the invention was not obvious to Dr. Uldall, it would not have been obvious to a mere skilled by unimaginative technician.",
    "[24]\nAgainst this evidence that the solution was far from obvious, the defendants produced two experts: Clair Strohl and Dr. Stanley Shaldon. Strohl has the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering. He has many years of experience in the engineering and production of medical devices including those for blood processing and handling. After working for various manufacturers of these products he is now an independent engineering consultant \"in the medical device area and, in particular ... as it relates to the application of plastics and medical devices\". He did not precisely say that in 1981 the Mahurkar design would have been obvious to him. He said that if in 1979 he had been given a double-\"D\" lumen plastic tube and asked to put a tip on it suitable for percutaneous insertation by the Seldinger technique he thinks he would have ended up with a conical tapered tip having one lumen open to the tip and the other closed with access through holes in the side of the catheter. This in my view does not amount to evidence that the device conceived by Dr. Mahurkar was obvious. It was Dr. Mahurkar who had made to his specifications the double-\"D\" flexible thermoplastic tubing and it was he who concluded that a conical tip of a certain design with one lumen open at the tip and the other lumen open at the side of the catheter would function best. Mr. Strohl did not say that he would have had this idea but only that if asked to make such a device with appropriate instructions as to the end product required, he could have made it. Apart from this Mr. Strohl in his affidavit analyzed a lengthy list of prior art pleaded by the defendants in this action. He prepared an inventory of features of the patent which could be found in one form or another in some of the prior art. I find his evidence unconvincing on the question of obviousness.",
    "[25]\nDr. Shaldon, who is Head of the Research Section of the Department of Nephrology at the University Hospital in Nimes, France is unquestionably a medical authority of renown who is responsible for important advances in techniques for hemodialysis particularly with respect to percutaneous catheters. He too in his affidavit said that if he had been aware of double-\"D\" flexible material suitable for percutaneous use in a catheter he would have had no problems in forming a conical tip. He refers however to forming a conical tip \"similar to the one which I formed on my catheter shown in Schedule 'H' hereto\". Schedule \"H\", as I understand it, depicts a conical tube which is not smoothly tapered on one plane as is Dr. Mahurkar's, and moreover it is fixed on a single lumen catheter. Further, he said that he could achieve this with the double-\"D\" flexible material \"if I had wanted to make use of it\". It was clear from Dr. Shaldon's evidence that he is quite sceptical about the use of double lumen catheters generally, because he feels that as they are normally larger than a single lumen catheter extra trauma is caused to the patient by their insertion. He expressed doubts that this additional trauma is justified by the advantage of the continuous flow of blood in and out as permitted by a dual lumen catheter, as compared to the alternating flow which is employed when dialysis is done through a single lumen catheter. In part, then, his evidence must be seen as somewhat similar to Mr. Strohl's, that is he could have produced some sort of tip on a double lumen catheter if somebody had given him the catheter. In part it suggests that it would not have occurred to him to use a double lumen catheter for this purpose and therefore he would never have undertaken to make such a tip. Further, the kind of tip which he said he could make was not, in point of fact, the kind of tip required on a dual lumen catheter. It must also be observed that while he described himself as a \"medical bricoleur\", he is an expert in this field and not merely an unimaginative skilled workman.",
    "[26]\nI have reviewed the prior art at some length and I do not find it to demonstrate that Dr. Mahurkar's invention was obvious. As Mr. Strohl has demonstrated in his affidavit, one can find features here and there common to the patent in issue in various pieces of the prior art. In some cases the commonality is established only through the use of very general terms of description. I have rejected at the outset items 1.I, 1.J, and 1.K, of the schedule of prior art pleaded by the defendants in their particulars of objection. As I have found the invention date to have been some time in January, 1981 these items, all of which are dated after that time, can form no part of the prior art. As for the rest, none of them can be used for precisely the purpose for which the Mahurkar catheter is designed. (In this respect I am satisfied that I can look to the whole of the specifications of the patent in determining the purpose of the invention). Some of the prior art items are not intended for nor are they suitable for the transmission of blood. Most of them do not have lumens of equal size or \"D\"-shaped lumens. Most of them have no conical tapered tip. As noted before, Mr. Strohl did not go so far as to say that the design of a catheter and tip such as that of Dr. Mahurkar would have been obvious to him from these items of prior art. He only points out that one can find features of the Mahurkar device in such art, but such features are never found in one place nor are they designed and combined in a way suitable for percutaneous subclavian insertion of a catheter for purposes of hemodialysis.",
    "[27]\nIn reviewing the prior art I have also been persuaded by counsel for the plaintiff that an objective test should be applied to determine whether the hypothetical skilled workman in the art could be reasonably assumed to have knowledge of such prior art. There appears to be adequate authority in the jurisprudence [see footnote 6] for such a test. No evidence was produced by the defendants to show that the ordinary skilled workman should be assumed to have been aware of all of this prior art. Frankly I find it difficult to believe that several of the items of prior art would have been present to the mind of the ordinary skilled workman in 1981.",
    "[28]\nI am further satisfied from the evidence of its commercial success that Dr. Mahurkar's invention was not obvious. For reasons which I have set out above, I am satisfied that the Quinton product known as the \"Mahurkar Catheter\" incorporates the substance of Dr. Mahurkar's invention. Mr. Quinton testified as to the rapid acceptance of this product on the market and the considerable sales which it has enjoyed since its introduction in June of 1983. Some sales figures are set out in P6 and P10 and while there may be some debate over the precise sales attributable to the Mahurkar Catheter, it is clear that these have amounted to several million dollars (U.S.) during the four years following the introduction of this product. Both Dr. Uldall and Dr. Shaldon agreed that the dual lumen catheter of this configuration (whether made by Quintin, Vas-Cath, or other producers, against some of whom infringement actions are pending in the U.S.) now dominates the North American market for hemodialysis catheters. It has been less successful in Europe but may have a 20% to 25% share of the market there according to Dr. Shaldon. He referred to other factors which have tended to limit its use in Europe. Dr. Uldall made it clear that prior to 1981 there was a problem which various people were seeking to solve, that Dr. Mahurkar solved the problem with his device, and that this achievement has been recognized through the rapid adoption of catheters of this type. While evidence of commercial success must be viewed with caution and is often ambiguous, in the present case I find it clear and persuasive.",
    "[29]\nI therefore am satisfied that the defendants have not established that the invention embodied in patent '508 was obvious in January, 1981 when Dr. Mahurkar achieved it.\nCompliance with section 36(1) of the Patent Act",
    "[30]\nThe defendants contend that the plaintiff has not in his patent complied with this section because the patent fails to describe adequately, or at all, a number of matters pertaining to his invention. These are set out in the particulars of objection in the defendants' pleadings. Those which appear to me to have been relied upon during the trial are as follows: the meaning of \"the relative concentration of material\" with reference to the tip as referred to in claim 14 and elsewhere, and where such material is to come from; how to form the conical tip including this material; the specific materials of which the tube and tip are to be made; and how to construct such a device which will have the utility claimed for it. Other matters set out in the particulars of objection were not relied upon in argument on behalf of the defendants.",
    "[31]\nIn applying s. 36(1) it is clear that I can look at the whole of the patent to see if the requisite information can be found in either the disclosures or the claims. This is clear from the wording of s. 36(1) itself which merely requires that the applicant describe \"in the specification\" the invention and its operation or use. The specification includes both the disclosures and the claims. The jurisprudence has confirmed this approach to s. 36(1) [see footnote 7]. While I have concluded that certain of the claims are invalid, for purposes of applying s. 36(1) I could have resorted to all of the claims. That will not be necessary, however, as I have concluded that the necessary description can be found in the disclosures and the valid claims.",
    "[32]\nThe jurisprudence also confirms that in applying s. 36(1) the court should not be too technical in its approach [see footnote 8]. As Duff, C.J.C., said in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a reasonable view of it, can be so read as to afford the inventor protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented, the court, as a rule, will endeavour to give effect to that construction.\"\nFurther, what I must ascertain is what the whole of the patent would have meant, at the date it issued, to a person skilled in the art [see footnote 10].",
    "[33]\nAs for the meaning of the phrase \"relative concentration of material\" expert witnesses for the defendants professed bewilderment as to its meaning. Mr. Strohl could not see where this material would come from. As I indicated in respect of the infringement issue, I interpret the evidence as a whole to support the view that insertion of a plug in one lumen prior to the forming of the tip, as is done by the defendants in the fabrication of their product, can create a \"concentration of material\". Mr. Strohl in his evidence described the Blake patent of 1972 as involving a dual lumen catheter in which, at the formation stage, a plastic plug is inserted in one lumen and a round wire in the other lumen. A tapered tip is then formed by a heated die which according to him \"at the same time causes the plastic plug to lose its identity and merge into the material of the catheter tube resulting in a thickening of the tip\". I am at a loss to know why this does not create what could be described as a \"relative concentration of material\", nor why a skilled workman reading the present patent in 1985 when it was issued would not understand that as one possible meaning. Mr. Martin, on examination for discovery, in describing the process used to make the defendants' catheters, said that when the plug is inserted in the second lumen and the catheter is then heated in a mold to form the conical tip, the tubing and the plug \"liquify and flow together\" to form a unitary structure. He further said that in making catheters with a glass mold, such processes \"tend to form a concentration of material and make a more rigid ... tip\". He said these techniques were known to him in 1975. Further, in respect of the modified version of their catheters which have been produced since March, 1987 where a plug is used to block off the lumen but does not extend as far as the tip, the formation of the tip creates a thickening of the wall of the catheter between the plug and the tip (some open space being first left in a former portion of the second lumen before this thickening commences). As he said, \"that thickening results from the material that is integral with the tip\". An expert witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal, Glenn L. Beall, of Gurnee, Illinois, President of Glenn Beall Engineering Incorporated which is a manufacturer inter alia of catheters, testified (transcript, pages 991-993) that he could readily achieve a concentration of material in the fabrication of such a tip by deforming some additional portion of tube material beyond the tip and displacing that to the tip area. Mr. Beall said that he understood \"relative concentration of material\" simply to mean that there would be more material in a certain area than elsewhere. I conclude that a skilled workman would have understood the term \"relative concentration of material\" to have such a meaning and further would have known possible sources of such material, such as an additional plug fused into the tube through heating or the displacement into this area of extra material from an additional portion of the tubing.",
    "[34]\nThe other major difficulty which the defendants assert with respect to this patent is that it does not make clear how the tip is to be formed: whether it is to be manufactured as a separate piece bonded onto the end of the dual lumen tube, or is to be integrally formed from the tube itself. The defendants say that the patent in this respect is ambiguous and confusing. At page 8, lines 9 to 16 of patent '508, part of the disclosures, it is stated:\n\"The tip 20 including the relative concentration of material 23 is easily molded and bonded or is integrally formed from the cylindrical tube 11 by the use of internal and external mandrels and the application of heat by any number of conventional means such as RF forming, thermal forming, or infrared forming.\"\nFurther, in the patent drawings as reproduced at the beginning of this judgment, in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 there is a horizontal line above the tip 20 at a point where the tip ceases to taper and the cylindrical tubing of uniform diameter begins. In figure 7, on the other hand, a portion of the cylindrical tubing and the tapered tip are depicted as one integral piece. Both Dr. Shaldon and Mr. Strohl testifying on behalf of the defendants said that they understood figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 to depict a separate tip bonded to the tube. Both were of the opinion that it would be dangerous to bond the tip to the tube as secure adhesion could not be assured, and it would be very harmful to a patient if a tip came loose during the use of the catheter. Dr. Uldall said that one could bond the tip \"face to face with the lumen\" but that he would \"worry about the end becoming disconnected\" and therefore he would not use such a catheter. Mr. Beall on the other hand said that it would be difficult but not impossible to bond a tip to the tube securely. Mr. Quinton, another catheter manufacturer, said that he was not prepared to agree that it would be impractical to bond the tip to the tube although for the particular manufacturing processes of his company it was preferable to use a separate tip with inserts as they do in the manufacture of the Mahurkar catheter. Mr. Beall, however, testified that reading the patent as a whole he believed it taught the use of an integrally formed tip. He said that although there might be some ambiguity in the less detailed figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 because of the horizontal line which traverses the catheter at the base of the tip, a skilled workman would know that figure 7 which is the more detailed drawing of the tip area should be determinative. I am satisfied from his evidence that figure 7 depicts an integrally formed tip. I do not believe that any of the defendants' witnesses really contradicted this although they found figure 7 inadequate because it does not clearly explain from where the \"relative concentration of material\" is to come.",
    "[35]\nCounsel for the defendants argued on the basis of this evidence that the patent teaches the use of a separate tip bonded face to face with the end of the dual lumen tubing, that such device would be dangerous for patients, and that therefore the invention described lacks utility; or that at least it is so ambiguous as to mislead a skilled workman into one possible implementation of the patent which would not serve the purpose stated in the patent. Counsel relied in this respect on the decision of my colleague Collier, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relevant principle is to be found in the decision of the Supreme Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  used in making electrocardiograms, etc. The claims described a cream \"composed of an aqueous emulsion\" which would contain, inter alia, \"1-10% of a highly ionizable salt ...\" It was contended that the patent did not meet the requirements of s. 36(1) of the Patent Act because this general language could include salts and solutions which might be corrosive to the skin. The Supreme Court rejected this contention because the addressee of a patent is a man skilled in the art [see footnote 13].\n\"... and the knowledge such a man is expected to possess is to be taken into consideration. To such a man it must be obvious that a cream for use with skin contact electrodes is not to be made up with ingredients that are toxic or irritating or are apt to stain or discolour the skin.\"\nIn the present case, even if Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 must be interpreted as depicting the separate bonded tip which is referred to in the disclosures as a possible design, the evidence was not clear that its use would be impossible. If it would be, this is a matter a skilled workman would know and he would not pursue this option. What the patent does is to provide a design for a dual lumen catheter with conical tip. It does not provide, nor do I think it needs to provide, manufacturing instructions. It shows the configuration required and the purposes are clear. I am satisfied that a skilled workman could take this patent and produce a catheter of that configuration, using his own knowledge to avoid constructions which would be dangerous. For the reasons which I have found infringement to exist, it is apparent that the defendants are manufacturing a catheter which incorporates the substance, and for that matter the text, of the patent. I have also indicated that I think the Mahurkar catheter manufactured by Quinton incorporates this substance even though for its own reasons the Quinton Corporation employs a manufacturing technique not referred to in the patent. In this respect the situation differs from that in the Consolboard case where the invention claimed was for a device which did not work: the complaint there was not that the patent described various devices, some of which would not work. In the present case the invention claimed is not the manufacturing process but the design and function of the catheter. As quoted above, the disclosures refer to the \"use of internal and external mandrels and the application of heat by any number of conventional means\". This is not expressed, nor is it claimed, as the invention, as the evidence disclosed that workable fabrication processes are known for the production of a catheter of this design. None of the expert witnesses denied that. I am satisfied that any skilled workman with a mind willing to understand could read this patent and proceed to the fabrication of a safe catheter of this design.",
    "[36] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[37]\nThe defendants also contended that the patent does not adequately disclose the material of which the tube and tip are to be made. It is true that the only reference in the patent to this matter is at page 8 of the disclosures where it is stated:\n\"It is readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that the tip 20 as shown in FIG. 7 is easily formed from thermo-plastic material.\"\nMr. Beall indicated that this would be sufficient to direct a reader to a \"family of materials\" of which many were available and in use in the 1980's. Some would be known to be unsuitable. While the passage quoted only refers to the material in the tip, it also refers to figure 7 which clearly depicts the tip and the tube as being integrally formed. This would, it appears to me, convey to the skilled workman that in accordance with figure 7 the whole catheter should be made of the same thermo-plastic material. It appears to me that further guidance in this respect could be found on page 4 of the disclosures where it is stated at lines 3 to 10:\n\"The catheter also has a uniform diameter along its entire length from its proximal end to the conical tapered tip. The tip guidance point is located at the center of the conical tip for uniform distribution of frictional resistance and minimization of insertion trauma and kinking. The conical tapered tip comprises a relative concentration of material to impart relative rigidity so that the tip functions as an effective dilator for soft tissue and veins.\"\nThe reference to \"kinking\" clearly implies a flexible tube and the reference to a \"relative concentration of material\" in the tip \"to impart relative rigidity\" implies that otherwise the tip would be of the same flexibility as the tube. Given also the number of thermoplastic percutaneous catheters on the market in September, 1985 when this patent issued, I find it hard to believe that a skilled workman would have difficulty in understanding what kind of material is to be used both in the tip and in the tube of the catheter. The claims, of course, assert no invention with respect to the kind of material to be employed other than with respect to its two \"D\" configuration.",
    "[38]\nThe other objections pleaded with respect to s. 36(1) of the Patent Act not having been argued, and they having no apparent substance in my view, I find that the defendants have not established invalidity of the patent by reason of a failure to describe adequately the invention or any workable invention.\nClaims Broader than the Invention Described",
    "[39]\nIn their particulars of objections filed with their statement of defence, the defendants alleged that the invention disclosed in the patent in question includes the following essential features:\n\"(a) a dual lumen catheter having two semi-circular or D-shaped lumens;\n\"(b) one lumen being shorter than the other;\n\"(c) a conical tapered tip at the distal end comprising 'a relative concentration of material' to impart relative rigidity to the tip; and\n\"(d) a tip guidance point at the centre of the conical tip.\"\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the affidavits sworn by the defendants' expert witnesses characterized the invention in almost identical language. The defendants contend that none of the claims of the patent is limited to a combination comprising all of these features. Accordingly each of them claims more than is disclosed in the specifications and more than the plaintiff invented and is thus invalid. It is also alleged that for the same reason they describe products which would not have the utility contemplated in the disclosures. I have already dealt with the utility question above.",
    "[40]\nThe plaintiff did not specifically take issue with these four elements identified by the defendants as the essentials of the invention and I believe they adequately encompass the invention revealed in the disclosures. In my view claims 7, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19, do have limitations to all of these features. It appears to me for example that claim 14 adequately limits the invention claimed to one containing these features. It commences by describing \"a double lumen catheter comprising an elongated cylindrical tube including a planar axial divider bisecting said cylindrical tube into first and second lumens\". I fail to see why this does not adequately describe \"a dual lumen catheter having two semi-circular or D-shaped lumens\". If one takes an elongated cylindrical tube and puts in it a \"planar axial divider bisecting\" that tube, one surely ends up with two lumens of equal size which are D-shaped. I should think this would be adequately clear to any one except, perhaps, a patent agent. Claim 14 goes on to state that the first lumen extends from the proximal end to the distal end of the tube and the second lumen extends from the proximal end \"to a second opening in the side of cylindrical tube, said second lumen terminating at said second opening ...\" I am unable to comprehend how that fails to describe a catheter with one lumen which is shorter than the other. If the first lumen extends from one end of the catheter to the other and the second lumen extends from one end to a hole in the side of the lumen at which point it terminates, I fail to understand how the second lumen can be other than shorter than the first lumen. Claim 14 also goes on to speak of \"a relative concentration of material extending axially from the second opening to the distal end of said cylindrical tube, the distal end of said cylindrical tube having a smooth conical tapered tip\". Again, it appears to me that this adequately limits the claim to a device with the features described in item (c) as defined above by the defendants. It is true that the claim does not explain the purpose of the relative concentration of material (i.e. \"to impart relative rigidity\" to the tip as stated in the disclosures) but that is surely unnecessary to effect the limitation of the scope of the claim to that which has been invented. With respect to item (d) identified by the defendants, \"a tip guidance point at the centre of the conical tip\", it is true that claim 14 does not employ these words which are similar to those found in the disclosures. I do not think, however, that it would be very difficult for a skilled workman reading this claim to infer that that is the intention. The claim refers to the \"first lumen extending ... to a first opening at the distal end of said cylindrical tube ...\" It goes on to refer to \"the distal end of said cylindrical tube having a smooth conical tapered tip ...\" When one is dealing with devices of this size, and given the importance of having as free a flow of blood as possible from the first lumen through the tip, the most natural interpretation which would be put on this language is that the opening would be as large as the tip would permit which would mean that it would have to be essentially centered in the tip. If a skilled workman had any lingering doubts about this they would surely be dispelled if he read claim 17 which describes a device such as claimed in 14 except that the opening in the tip \"is eccentric with respect to the axis of the conical tapered tip\". In other words, as claim 17 describes a tip with a hole which is not centered, it contrasts with claim 14. Surely a reasonable skilled workman would then read claim 14 as describing a tip wherein the hole is centered. Although I have elsewhere considered claim 17 to be invalid I see no reason why it could not be read by a skilled workman in order to clarify the scope of claim 14. In any event I believe that claim 14 is adequately circumscribed in this respect.",
    "[41]\nFor similar reasons I find that claim 7, because it incorporates claim 1, involves the four essential features defined by the defendants. Claim 1 embodies features (b) and (d) and part of (c), whereas claim 7 embodies features (a) and the remainder of (c). Claims 15, 16, 18, and 19 incorporate claim 14 which I have already held to include the essential features, and none of the additional matters claimed in 15, 16, 18, and 19 are inconsistent with the four essential features.",
    "[42]\nOn the other hand I find the remainder of the claims in issue not to be sufficiently limited to the essential features of this invention as drawn from the disclosures. Claim 1 by itself lacks features (a) and the \"relative concentration of material\" referred to in feature (c). Claims 2 to 6, 8 to 10 and 13 are dependent on 1 and do not make up for its deficiencies. Claim 12 appears to be inconsistent with feature (d) and is therefore claiming something not described in the disclosures, as does, for similar reasons, claim 17.",
    "[43]\nClaim 21, the first of the third group of claims, also lacks features (a) and part of (c) (there being no reference to \"a relative concentration of material\"). None of the dependent claims 22 to 25 make up for these deficiencies.",
    "[44]\nAs noted earlier, claims 11, 20, and 26 are not in issue.",
    "[45]\nClaims 1 to 6, 8 to 10, 12, 13, 17, and 21 to 25 are therefore invalid because they claim more than is described in the disclosures.\nConclusions",
    "[46]\nI therefore find that there has been infringement of the patent and that the patent is valid except for certain claims. It was agreed at the trial that I would hear counsel with respect to the form of relief and to costs before a formal judgment is entered. In preparation for this hearing I would request counsel for the plaintiff to draft a formal judgment for consideration, and provide such draft to the court and counsel for the defendants prior to the hearing.\nAction allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\nFootnotes\n1.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, at 10 (F.C.A.).

  "full_text": "Introduction\n[1]\nStrayer, J.\n: This is an action for infringement of the plaintiff's Canadian patent 1,193,508 issued September 17, 1985 with respect to a \"smooth bore double lumen catheter\". The disclosures of the patent describe a use of this catheter in hemodialysis (the removal of blood from a patient suffering a kidney dysfunction, the cleansing and return of that blood) by means of insertion of the catheter into a large vein. The catheter, having two \"lumens\" or passages in it, carries away from the vein through one passage blood containing toxins, and returns to that vein through the other passage the cleansed blood once it has passed through a dialysis machine. Reproduced on p. 51 are the drawings from the patent in issue. In figure 1 can be seen, at the proximal end of the catheter, tube 17 which carries away the soiled blood from the catheter, and tube 16 which returns the clean blood from the dialysis machine.\nDRAWING OF DEFENDANTS' PRODUCT\n[Diagram omitted. See printed volume.]\nDRAWING FROM PATENT IN ISSUE\n[Diagram omitted. See printed volume.]\n[2]\nThe plaintiff is a physician employed by the Division of Nephrology in the Department of Medicine, Cook County Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, and an Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Chicago Medical School.\n[3]\nAccording to the statement of agreed facts, the defendant Vas-Cath is an Ontario corporation which manufactures and sells in Canada double lumen catheters known as VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000. Reproduced below are some drawings from a patent application filed by the defendant Vas-Cath on May 24, 1984.\n[4]\nAccording to Geoffrey S. Martin, President and 50% owner of Vas-Cath who was its representative at the examination for discovery held on November 13, 1986, the intent was that such drawings should cover the catheters then being manufactured by Vas-Cath. Subsequent to that examination for discovery, in March, 1987 Vas-Cath made some changes to the design of the VACCESS 3500 and of the VACCESS 4000. The only material alteration is described in a continuation of the examination for discovery held on November 20, 1987 and is marked on trial Exhibit P-29. The relevant change as indicated by Mr. Martin involves a gap or a space in the material marked as 56 and 58 in figure 3 above, the gap commencing at about midway between the numbers 56 and 46 and ending slightly to the right of the number 5 all as they appear in figure 3. It was also agreed in the statement of agreed facts that the defendant Gambro Canada Ltd. is the exclusive distributor for this kind of product of Vas-Cath throughout the world except in the U.S.A. It was further agreed that Vas-Cath has been manufacturing and selling in Canada the VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 double lumen catheters without any licence from the plaintiff and intends to continue to do so, and that Gambro has similarly distributed these catheters in Canada and intends to continue to do so.\n[5]\nThe defendants deny infringement, and as is usual in such cases deny the validity of the plaintiff's patent 1,193,508. They attack the validity on the grounds that the plaintiff is not the first inventor and that before the plaintiff applied for his patent (the priority date being August 15, 1984 the date of application for the corresponding U.S. patent) products embodying the same alleged invention had been made available to the public; that the plaintiff's application should have been rejected under s. 63(2) of the Patent Act because the defendant Vas-Cath had already obtained Canadian patent number 1,167,727 issued on May 22, 1984 for the same invention; that the plaintiff's invention had been anticipated by an earlier patent; that it was obvious having regard to the prior art; that it does not comply with the requirements of s. 36(1) of the Patent Act; and that the claims are wider than the invention disclosed.\n[6]\nPursuant to an order of this court made on November 18, 1986 any assessment of damages or profits arising from infringement is to be the subject of a reference under rule 500, should I find liability. I therefore need not deal with questions of quantum.\nInfringement\n[7]\nI have concluded that the catheters VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 sold by the defendants infringe at least certain of the claims of the plaintiff's patent. I find infringement of claims 7, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Claims 11, 20, and 26 are not in issue.\n[8]\nThe reasons for which I find infringement of these claims are well illustrated in Exhibit P11-38, part of the affidavit of the plaintiff testifying as an expert. He displays there side by side the drawings which Vas-Cath admits depict their product and the text of the claims, demonstrating by arrows where the various features described in the claims can be found in the drawing. I have reviewed this material and accept it as demonstrating infringement of the claims to which I have referred.\n[9]\nThe principal contention of the defendants with respect to infringement has been that their product does not involve a \"relative concentration of material extending axially from the second opening to the distal end of said cylindrical tube ...\" as referred to in claims 7 and 14. In figure 7 of the patent in issue, reproduced above, this \"concentration of material\" is depicted at 23. The defendants contend that as so described in the patent, it can refer only to material which is derived from the double lumen tubing itself or from a projection from a separate tip inserted into the second (shorter) lumen. By contrast, they point out (and this is not disputed) that their catheters use a separate plug of the same material as the lumens, the plug being inserted into the second lumen prior to formation of the tip, it appearing in figure 3 of the drawing of their product reproduced above as 56 and 58. Further, they point out that in the revised models of their catheters produced since March of 1987 there is a shorter plug blocking off the second lumen, then going toward the tip an open space (part of the original second lumen), and then solid material where the second lumen used to be, caused by the forming of the tip. Thus they contend that there is no \"relative concentration of material as contemplated by claim 14. I find this contention unconvincing. First, I believe that there is textual infringement of the patent because the words \"relative concentration of material\" in their normal usage do not as such imply the source of the \"material\". I see no reason why the \"material\" may not come from an extraneous source and be added to the material of the lumens to increase the \"concentration\" in a certain area. There was no expert evidence which clearly indicated to me why the ordinary meaning of the words should not apply in this case. In any event I am satisfied that there is substantive infringement by the defendants' catheters even though they insert a plug in one lumen to strengthen the tip instead of providing such thickening through integral moulding of the material already in the dual lumen tubing. As stated recently by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords [see footnote 1], a court should in interpreting a claim give it a \"purposive construction\" and not interpret it to exclude minor variants which to the knowledge of the inventor and the readers of the patent could have no material effect upon the way in which the invention works. That approach is clearly applicable here. It is clear from the evidence that the purpose of the \"relative concentration of material\" is to strengthen the tip of the catheter so that it will not bend unduly while being pushed through human tissue. The evidence satisfies me that this purpose would be evident to any one skilled in the art in reading the patent. To the achievement of this purpose, no one has demonstrated to me what possible difference it could make whether the concentration of material is integrally formed from the dual lumen tubing or whether it is provided by similar material in the form of a plug inserted into one of the lumens. There was evidence that when, so inserted, heat is applied, the effect is to meld the plug with the surrounding material. This surely results in a concentration of material in the area where the plug was placed. More importantly, the purpose of using this technique, and its net effect, is the same as if the extra material had been found in the tubing itself through melting and compaction of extra tubing material at the tip end. The use of a plug is a mere detail which does not save the defendants from infringement of the patent [see footnote 2]. For the same reasons, the innovation of a gap in the plug area as found in the new models of VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 produced since March, 1987 does not save those devices from infringing. Expert witnesses including Dr. Robert Uldall and Mr. Glen Beall testified that this variation would make no functional difference to the catheter. I am therefore satisfied that it also infringes in substance the plaintiff's patent.\n[10]\nThe defendants also contended that there was no infringement of claim 17 because it describes a catheter as claimed in claim 14:\n\"... wherein the first opening in the distal end of said cylindrical tube is eccentric with respect to the axis of the conical tapered tip.\"\n\"Eccentric\" is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as describing something which is \"not centrally placed\" or whose axis is not centrally placed. I therefore understand this claim to describe a tip in which the opening for the entry to the first lumen is off center of the tip. The defendants contend, and this appears to be the case, that the lumen opening in their tips is centered. For this reason I am not finding any infringement with claim 17, but this does not mean that the defendants have not infringed the other claims to which I have referred. At best, the precise location of the hole in the end of the tip is a minor variation which, as I understand the evidence, can have no serious effect on the way the catheter operates. A more general and important claim is claim 15 which requires that:\n\"... the apex of said conical tip is substantially aligned with the axis of said cylindrical tube.\"\nIn other words, this claim requires that the tip be essentially in the center point of the tube. According to the evidence this will facilitate insertion through human tissue. It is only within the diameter of that tip that the opening hold could be either centered or eccentric to the axis of the tube. Such variations must, by their nature, be minuscule and there was no evidence that a centered or eccentric position of the opening in the end of the conical tip would significantly affect the insertion of the catheter over a wire in accordance with the Seldinger technique. Claim 15 aptly describes the configuration of the defendants' products. The fact that they have not adopted the variation described in claim 17 does not exempt them from liability for infringement as they have appropriated the substance of the plaintiff's patent as set out in the claims to which I have referred.\n[11]\nAs will be explained below, I have found the remaining claims to be invalid and therefore will not analyze whether any of them are infringed by the defendants' products.\nPriority of Invention\n[12]\nI have concluded that the plaintiff, Doctor Mahurkar, was the inventor of the dual lumen subclavian catheter as described in the patent in issue and that he was therefore the first person to know of or use it. I find the following to be the salient facts. In 1977 Dr. Mahurkar had applied for, and on January 16, 1979 had obtained, U.S. patent 4,134,402 for a \"double lumen hemodialysis catheter\". This was actually a double lumen rigid needle, cylindrical in shape but divided internally by a septum which created two equal-sized \"D\"-shaped or semi-circular lumens for carrying away and returning blood. This needle would, as I understand it, normally be used for hemodialysis through insertion into a fistula, probably in the arm or leg. The needle did not have a tapered tip. The tip was bevelled, with one lumen continuing to the tip and the other lumen being cut away some distance back from the tip with its end open at that point. In the summer of 1979 Dr. Mahurkar conceived the idea of a plastic double lumen catheter and started to seek appropriate tubing from manufacturers. He finally obtained some suitable samples from Teal Plastics Inc. of Baraboo, Wisconsin. On December 22, 1980 he ordered a quantity of such double lumen extrusion from the company. In January of 1981 through experimentation at his home in Chicago in the development of a suitable tip for such tubing, he produced a few tapered tips which are now Exhibits P11-16. In April, 1981 and in approximately June, 1981 he had conversations with Mr. Wayne Quinton, Chairman of the Board of Quinton Instrument Company of Seattle, Washington. Mr. Quinton, whose company makes various medical products, was interested in the idea of dual lumen catheters for hemodialysis and he was intrigued by Dr. Mahurkar's dual lumen needle as covered by the U.S. '402 patent. While in his evidence he was somewhat unsure as to when Dr. Mahurkar first showed him the dual lumen tubing with tapered tips which are now Exhibits P11-16, it seems clear from the events that followed that this happened either in these meetings of April and June or in the subsequent months of 1981 when discussions were going on between Mr. Quinton and Dr. Mahurkar which culminated in a licence agreement being signed on February 1, 1982. (See Exhibit P-2, page 123 ff.) This licence agreement refers only to U.S. patent '402 but involved the obtaining, and grant, of a licence from Dr. Mahurkar to Quinton Instrument Company of the right to manufacture, use, sell and distribute, inter alia, a double lumen needle and a double lumen subclavian catheter. Pursuant to this agreement, the Quinton Instrument Company developed a double lumen subclavian catheter into a commercially successful product. In doing so Quinton developed a tapered tip which, though functioning the same as those subsequently depicted in the patent in issue, is fabricated separately with insertions which fit into the end of double lumen tubing to produce a product which externally is virtually identical to the catheter depicted in Canadian patent '508 (the patent in issue). A prototype of this catheter was displayed at a meeting of the American Society of Nephrology in Chicago in December, 1982. While it was not at that time ready for market it was displayed as a commercial product by Quinton at the American Society of Artificial Internal Organs meeting in Toronto in April, 1983. On both occasions it was seen by Geoffrey Martin, the President of the defendant Vas-Cath. By June, 1983 it was put on the market by Quinton under the name of the \"Mahurkar Catheter\". It continues to be sold under that name. Several million dollars (U.S.) worth of this catheter have been sold since June, 1983.\n[13]\nI am satisfied from the evidence that it was the work and discoveries of Dr. Mahurkar in the development of a usable dual lumen tubing and the design and placing thereon of a tapered tip which enabled the Quinton Instrument Company to put this catheter on the market. Mr. Quinton himself acknowledged that the development of the commercial product flowed from the agreement, particularly with reference to the exclusive licence granted by paragraph 1.2 with respect to a \"double lumen subclavian catheter\". He referred to the transfer, pursuant to the agreement, of inventory in the hands of Dr. Mahurkar. The company agreed under the licence agreement to refer to such products by the name of Dr. Mahurkar and it has done so with respect to its product (P-7). It advertises its product as the Mahurkar Catheter (P-8, P-9). The fact that before going into commercial production Quinton developed a separately moulded tip, rather than using an integrally moulded tip as Dr. Mahurkar did in his original prototypes, takes nothing away from Dr. Mahurkar's invention. Mr. Quinton explained in evidence that for his particular plant it was more economical to mould the tip separately when undertaking production in commercial quantities. This does not alter the fact that the design was Dr. Mahurkar's and that the \"Mahurkar Catheter\" sold by Quinton since June, 1983 incorporates the substance of Dr. Mahurkar's invention.\n[14]\nDr. Mahurkar subsequently applied on August 15, 1984 for a U.S. patent on a \"smooth bore double lumen catheter\" and made a counterpart Canadian application on August 28, 1984. Canadian patent 1,193,508, the patent in issue, was subsequently issued on September 17, 1985 as a result of this application.\n[15]\nAs the defendants have asserted that Geoffrey Martin, the President of the defendant Vas-Cath, made this invention, I will set out briefly my findings with respect to the activities of Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin commenced the Vas-Cath business in 1977 and the company was incorporated in January, 1979. From the outset Vas-Cath specialized in manufacturing catheters. Some time in 1978 Mr. Martin met Dr. Robert Uldall, the Director of Hemodialysis at Toronto Western Hospital and Associate Professor, Division of Nephrology, Toronto Western Hospital. Mr. Martin acting under Dr. Uldall's direction developed both a single lumen catheter and a double lumen catheter for dialysis. The double lumen catheter was co-axial, that is it consisted of one tube inside another. As a result of disagreements, Dr. Uldall and Vas-Cath discontinued collaboration in November, 1979. Vas-Cath continued to produce a dual lumen co-axial catheter thereafter. Dr. Mahurkar, who lives in Chicago, had heard of Vas-Cath as a commercial manufacturer of catheters and contacted that firm by telephone sometime after he developed the tips found in Exhibits P11-16, to discuss the possibility of it making some tips for him. After contacting Vas-Cath by telephone, he sent to it on April 2, 1981 some seventy pieces of his double lumen catheter tubing, these being sent \"for forming a smooth tip and bevel satisfactory for penetration test\". (See P3-6). On April 21, 1981 Vas-Cath returned to Dr. Mahurkar sixteen of these pieces of tubing, fourteen of which had tips. (See P-2, page 96). None of these tips were of the tapered design which is the subject of the patent in issue. As noted above Martin saw the prototype of the Mahurkar catheter as produced by Quinton in December, 1982. He saw it again as a product then commercially available in April, 1983. He says that he developed the catheter with the tip which Vas-Cath uses in its product during the summer and fall of 1983. The first sales of the Vas-Cath catheter of the type allegedly infringing the plaintiff's patent occurred in January, 1984. On May 24, 1984 Martin applied for a patent for his catheter, and such patent was issued on March 31, 1987. It is common ground that the claims of this Canadian patent 1,219,785 describe an invention covered by the claims of the plaintiff's patent 1,193,508.\n[16]\nIt will be apparent that in finding the facts as I have, I have preferred the evidence of the plaintiff to that of Mr. Martin on behalf of Vas-Cath. The evidence of the plaintiff as to the time of the invention was corroborated in important respects by documents and the evidence of other witnesses concerning his search for a manufacturer of tubing meeting his specifications, his discussions with other persons, and the course of his cooperation with Mr. Quinton leading to the production and sale of the \"Mahurkar Catheter\". On the other hand Mr. Martin says that he got the idea for such a catheter on March 21, 1978 while at Boynton Beach, Florida. In support of this contention he identified drawings on the back of Exhibit D-8 which he says he made at that time. These drawings show three possible designs for a double lumen catheter one of which appears to be similar to that of the plaintiff. I am aware of no other evidence which corroborates the date or authorship of this design. Nor was there any evidence that he developed this design into a workable product until after the Mahurkar catheter was actually on the market. I am further inclined to believe that Dr. Mahurkar was the inventor rather than Mr. Martin because Dr. Mahurkar had the requisite skills to create an appropriate design and Mr. Martin did not. In expert evidence given by both Dr. Mahurkar and Dr. Uldall it was said that the design of such a catheter requires extensive medical knowledge, particularly that related to the behaviour of blood, as well as knowledge of the technology of hypodermic needle and catheter manufacture. Dr. Mahurkar's training and experience equipped him for this task. By contrast, Mr. Martin's academic training is in music. He said on examination for discovery that with respect to medical supplies he was\n\"... self-taught by examining U.S.C.I. catheters and slicing them apart and seeing how they were put together; knowing what they were used for; and researching new types of products.\"\nWhile he no doubt has developed a certain amount of technical skill in the manufacture of catheters I have concluded, from the foregoing and other evidence, that with respect to this catheter he was more opportunist than inventor.\n[17]\nAs I have concluded that Dr. Mahurkar is the inventor of the invention disclosed in his patent '508, and that it was not known or used by any other person including Mr. Martin before he invented it, all of the defendants' pleas of invalidity based on paragraph 28(1)(a) and s. 63(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, must be dismissed.\n[18]\nIn addition, the defendants rely on s. 63(2) of the Patent Act which provides:\n\"63(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 43, an application for a patent for an invention for which a patent has already issued under this Act shall be rejected unless the applicant, within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner, commences an action to set aside the prior patent, so far as it covers the invention in question, but if such action is so commenced and diligently prosecuted, the application shall not be deemed to have been abandoned unless the applicant fails to proceed upon it within a reasonable time after the action has been finally disposed of.\"\nThey contend that since Vas-Cath had applied for a patent for a dual lumen cannula on November 26, 1981, and thereby obtained Canadian patent 1,167,727 issued May 22, 1984, there was a patent already issued for the same invention as was contained in the plaintiff's application of August 28, 1984, for the patent in issue. (Although the defendants' pleadings refer to patent 1,116,727 I assume in the context that patent 1,167,727 is intended). Thus it is contended that since the Commissioner did not fix a time within which the plaintiff as applicant for the patent should have commenced action against Vas-Cath as holder of patent '727, the plaintiff's application should have been rejected and his patent must therefore be treated as invalid. I am not satisfied from the evidence that Vas-Cath's earlier patent '727 is for the same invention as that covered by the plaintiff's subsequent patent '508. While involving the use of the same kind of dual lumen cylindrical tubing bisected internally by a septum, it does not have a smoothly tapered conical point. One lumen terminates in an opening at the distal end, but the other lumen terminates in an inclined plane closing off the second lumen before it reaches the distal end. There was insufficient evidence to satisfy me that this should be regarded as the same invention as that described in the plaintiff's patent '508. It is interesting to note, however, that as a result of the exchange of letters and materials between the plaintiff and Vas-Cath in April, 1981, Vas-Cath retained in its possession many pieces of the dual lumen tubing which the plaintiff had developed. After a meeting in Toronto on June 30, 1981, at which the plaintiff and Vas-Cath were unable to come to an agreement about the manufacture of plaintiff's catheter, the defendant Vas-Cath lost no time in seeking the patent for the kind of catheter described in its patent '727. On July 6th Mr. Martin sent instructions to his patent attorney with respect to a patent application. On July 24, 1981, Martin applied for a U.S. patent equivalent to patent '727, and the application for the Canadian patent was then made on November 26, 1981. This patent clearly utilizes the kind of dual lumen tubing developed by Dr. Mahurkar.\nAnticipation\n[19]\nThe defendants rely solely on the Pfarre patent, a U.S. patent issued in 1882, as anticipating the patent in issue. The Pfarre patent describes a catheter of soft rubber rounded, not tapered, at the end. It has within it two channels or lumens which are not of equal size. In one embodiment one of the lumens does lead to an opening at the distal end while the other lumen receives or discharges fluid through a hole in the side of the tube.\n[20]\nThe test for anticipation is very rigorous. For a prior document or patent to anticipate a patent whose validity is attacked, the former must be so clear and so apposite as inevitably to lead skilled workmen to the latter [see footnote 3]. I find that the Pfarre patent does not meet these requirements. There was no evidence that the Pfarre patent was ever implemented in a usable product and as a \"paper anticipation\" it must be viewed very strictly. The evidence from the expert witnesses was, of course, conflicting. Taking that evidence into account, and reading the two patents I am unable to conclude that the Pfarre patent would have inevitably led a skilled workman to the invention depicted in patent '508. For example, the Pfarre patent says nothing of the importance of having two D-shaped lumens of similar size. This aspect of the invention claimed is stated in claim 14 of patent '508 where it refers to \"a planar axial divider bisecting said cylindrical tube into first and second lumens ...\" Claim 7 states a similar requirement. A divider bisecting a tube must of necessity create two D-shaped lumens of similar size. The evidence has demonstrated that from the standpoint of the fluid dynamics of blood this configuration is very important. The drawing in Pfarre in fact depicts two lumens of quite unequal size. Further, the specifications say nothing as to the shape of the distal end of the catheter although the drawings depict a hemispherical end. Claim 14 of patent '508 calls for a \"smooth conical tapered tip that smoothly merges with the cylindrical surface of said cylindrical tube ...\" Claim 1 (as adopted by claim 7) has a similar requirement. It is apparent to me from the disclosures and the evidence that this is a very important feature of this catheter because of the need to insert it through the skin and into a vein, notwithstanding the evidence of one expert, Dr. Shaldon, that the difference for these purposes between a conical and hemispherical shape would be \"immaterial\". Further, claims 7 and 14 require \"a relative concentration of material\" near the tip to add rigidity for these purposes. The Pfarre patent says nothing of this requirement. Quite apart from these important differences between the actual devices, a skilled person reading it would not \"in every case and without possibility of error be led to\" [see footnote 4] the invention in issue. The whole stated purpose of Pfarre is different: it is an invention to be used for flushing out body cavities by means of insertions through existing orifices. As the specifications state:\n\"This invention is for use in washing, bathing, cooling, or warming and cleansing the bladder, stomach, ears, nose, rectum, and other diseased cavities or wounds of the human or animal body.\"\nAs the inventor states at a later point:\n\"I have experimented for some time, and have at last succeeded in producing an instrument that will be soft and easy of introduction, so that patients may be educated by their physicians to wash their bladder, stomach, &c., without pain and with ease.\"\nBy contrast, the disclosures of the patent in issue clearly show that it deals with a double lumen catheter designed for effecting the exchange of blood for purposes of hemodialysis, by means of penetration of the skin and blood vessels. Both Dr. Mahurkar and one of the defendants' witnesses, Dr. Shaldon, testifying as experts, said that Pfarre was designed for completely different purposes. The evidence satisfies me that the difference in purpose of the two devices is so material that Pfarre could not be seen as a source of clear direction for someone trying to devise a percutaneous dual lumen hemodialysis catheter. Such a connection between the two could only, I fear, be apparent to a patent agent or his computer. It is certainly curious that if this 1882 patent provided all the necessary information it took ninety-nine years for anyone to produce the kind of device depicted in the patent in issue. I appreciate, of course, that in the rarefied world of patents, such a banal observation is legally irrelevant to the question of whether an earlier patent is an anticipation of a later patent.\n[21]\nI therefore find that the invention in patent '508 was not anticipated by the Pfarre patent.\nObviousness\n[22]\nWhile obviousness may be established by demonstrating that through a variety of information available to the \"inventor\" from diverse sources the \"invention\" should have been obvious to him and therefore was not truly an \"invention\", this principle must be applied with great caution. As Hugessen, J., said on behalf of the Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy.\"\nIn the present case I am particularly mindful of his observation at page 295:\n\"Every invention is obvious after it has been made, and to no one more so than an expert in the field. Where the expert has been hired for the purpose of testifying, his infallible hindsight is even more suspect. It is so easy, once the teaching of a patent is known, to say, 'I could have done that'; before the assertion can be given any weight, one must have a satisfactory answer to the question, 'Why didn't you?'\"\n[23]\nWhile there was, of course, conflicting expert evidence on whether at the time Dr. Mahurkar made his invention it would have been obvious to a skilled technician in the art, I am satisfied on balance that the defendants have not met the burden of proof which lies on them to establish obviousness. I have given the most weight to the evidence of Dr. Uldall and Dr. Mahurkar. They are both medical specialists in this area who had both been engaged in the search for a device which would function for the purposes, and with the success, of the device covered by the patent in issue. Both make it clear in their evidence that there was a recognized problem - the need to have a more satisfactory dual lumen catheter to facilitate continuous hemodialysis - on which various people were working. In other words, the solution was not obvious. While Dr. Mahurkar is of course an interested party and his expert evidence must be viewed with some caution, Dr. Uldall has no interest at stake and his evidence was to the same effect. He was indeed a most persuasive witness. He is generally credited with introducing the technique of using a catheter in the subclavian vein for purposes of dialysis. He invented a single lumen catheter for this purpose and then a co-axial double lumen catheter. Before his co-axial double lumen catheter had really enjoyed wide-spread sales, however, the Mahurkar catheter as manufactured and sold by Quinton had come on the market. Dr. Uldall testified that he immediately recognized that the Mahurkar catheter was superior to his own. He said that when Dr. Mahurkar first showed him privately some of his early prototype catheters, Dr. Uldall was doubtful that they would work because he felt that the inlet holes on the side of the catheter, intended to allow the passage of blood into the inlet lumen, would become blocked by adhesion to the side of the blood vessel. In fact this proved not to be the case. He also recognized the superiority of the double-\"D\" tubing over his co-axial design but such a structure had not occurred to him for this kind of catheter. If the invention was not obvious to Dr. Uldall, it would not have been obvious to a mere skilled by unimaginative technician.\n[24]\nAgainst this evidence that the solution was far from obvious, the defendants produced two experts: Clair Strohl and Dr. Stanley Shaldon. Strohl has the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering. He has many years of experience in the engineering and production of medical devices including those for blood processing and handling. After working for various manufacturers of these products he is now an independent engineering consultant \"in the medical device area and, in particular ... as it relates to the application of plastics and medical devices\". He did not precisely say that in 1981 the Mahurkar design would have been obvious to him. He said that if in 1979 he had been given a double-\"D\" lumen plastic tube and asked to put a tip on it suitable for percutaneous insertation by the Seldinger technique he thinks he would have ended up with a conical tapered tip having one lumen open to the tip and the other closed with access through holes in the side of the catheter. This in my view does not amount to evidence that the device conceived by Dr. Mahurkar was obvious. It was Dr. Mahurkar who had made to his specifications the double-\"D\" flexible thermoplastic tubing and it was he who concluded that a conical tip of a certain design with one lumen open at the tip and the other lumen open at the side of the catheter would function best. Mr. Strohl did not say that he would have had this idea but only that if asked to make such a device with appropriate instructions as to the end product required, he could have made it. Apart from this Mr. Strohl in his affidavit analyzed a lengthy list of prior art pleaded by the defendants in this action. He prepared an inventory of features of the patent which could be found in one form or another in some of the prior art. I find his evidence unconvincing on the question of obviousness.\n[25]\nDr. Shaldon, who is Head of the Research Section of the Department of Nephrology at the University Hospital in Nimes, France is unquestionably a medical authority of renown who is responsible for important advances in techniques for hemodialysis particularly with respect to percutaneous catheters. He too in his affidavit said that if he had been aware of double-\"D\" flexible material suitable for percutaneous use in a catheter he would have had no problems in forming a conical tip. He refers however to forming a conical tip \"similar to the one which I formed on my catheter shown in Schedule 'H' hereto\". Schedule \"H\", as I understand it, depicts a conical tube which is not smoothly tapered on one plane as is Dr. Mahurkar's, and moreover it is fixed on a single lumen catheter. Further, he said that he could achieve this with the double-\"D\" flexible material \"if I had wanted to make use of it\". It was clear from Dr. Shaldon's evidence that he is quite sceptical about the use of double lumen catheters generally, because he feels that as they are normally larger than a single lumen catheter extra trauma is caused to the patient by their insertion. He expressed doubts that this additional trauma is justified by the advantage of the continuous flow of blood in and out as permitted by a dual lumen catheter, as compared to the alternating flow which is employed when dialysis is done through a single lumen catheter. In part, then, his evidence must be seen as somewhat similar to Mr. Strohl's, that is he could have produced some sort of tip on a double lumen catheter if somebody had given him the catheter. In part it suggests that it would not have occurred to him to use a double lumen catheter for this purpose and therefore he would never have undertaken to make such a tip. Further, the kind of tip which he said he could make was not, in point of fact, the kind of tip required on a dual lumen catheter. It must also be observed that while he described himself as a \"medical bricoleur\", he is an expert in this field and not merely an unimaginative skilled workman.\n[26]\nI have reviewed the prior art at some length and I do not find it to demonstrate that Dr. Mahurkar's invention was obvious. As Mr. Strohl has demonstrated in his affidavit, one can find features here and there common to the patent in issue in various pieces of the prior art. In some cases the commonality is established only through the use of very general terms of description. I have rejected at the outset items 1.I, 1.J, and 1.K, of the schedule of prior art pleaded by the defendants in their particulars of objection. As I have found the invention date to have been some time in January, 1981 these items, all of which are dated after that time, can form no part of the prior art. As for the rest, none of them can be used for precisely the purpose for which the Mahurkar catheter is designed. (In this respect I am satisfied that I can look to the whole of the specifications of the patent in determining the purpose of the invention). Some of the prior art items are not intended for nor are they suitable for the transmission of blood. Most of them do not have lumens of equal size or \"D\"-shaped lumens. Most of them have no conical tapered tip. As noted before, Mr. Strohl did not go so far as to say that the design of a catheter and tip such as that of Dr. Mahurkar would have been obvious to him from these items of prior art. He only points out that one can find features of the Mahurkar device in such art, but such features are never found in one place nor are they designed and combined in a way suitable for percutaneous subclavian insertion of a catheter for purposes of hemodialysis.\n[27]\nIn reviewing the prior art I have also been persuaded by counsel for the plaintiff that an objective test should be applied to determine whether the hypothetical skilled workman in the art could be reasonably assumed to have knowledge of such prior art. There appears to be adequate authority in the jurisprudence [see footnote 6] for such a test. No evidence was produced by the defendants to show that the ordinary skilled workman should be assumed to have been aware of all of this prior art. Frankly I find it difficult to believe that several of the items of prior art would have been present to the mind of the ordinary skilled workman in 1981.\n[28]\nI am further satisfied from the evidence of its commercial success that Dr. Mahurkar's invention was not obvious. For reasons which I have set out above, I am satisfied that the Quinton product known as the \"Mahurkar Catheter\" incorporates the substance of Dr. Mahurkar's invention. Mr. Quinton testified as to the rapid acceptance of this product on the market and the considerable sales which it has enjoyed since its introduction in June of 1983. Some sales figures are set out in P6 and P10 and while there may be some debate over the precise sales attributable to the Mahurkar Catheter, it is clear that these have amounted to several million dollars (U.S.) during the four years following the introduction of this product. Both Dr. Uldall and Dr. Shaldon agreed that the dual lumen catheter of this configuration (whether made by Quintin, Vas-Cath, or other producers, against some of whom infringement actions are pending in the U.S.) now dominates the North American market for hemodialysis catheters. It has been less successful in Europe but may have a 20% to 25% share of the market there according to Dr. Shaldon. He referred to other factors which have tended to limit its use in Europe. Dr. Uldall made it clear that prior to 1981 there was a problem which various people were seeking to solve, that Dr. Mahurkar solved the problem with his device, and that this achievement has been recognized through the rapid adoption of catheters of this type. While evidence of commercial success must be viewed with caution and is often ambiguous, in the present case I find it clear and persuasive.\n[29]\nI therefore am satisfied that the defendants have not established that the invention embodied in patent '508 was obvious in January, 1981 when Dr. Mahurkar achieved it.\nCompliance with section 36(1) of the Patent Act\n[30]\nThe defendants contend that the plaintiff has not in his patent complied with this section because the patent fails to describe adequately, or at all, a number of matters pertaining to his invention. These are set out in the particulars of objection in the defendants' pleadings. Those which appear to me to have been relied upon during the trial are as follows: the meaning of \"the relative concentration of material\" with reference to the tip as referred to in claim 14 and elsewhere, and where such material is to come from; how to form the conical tip including this material; the specific materials of which the tube and tip are to be made; and how to construct such a device which will have the utility claimed for it. Other matters set out in the particulars of objection were not relied upon in argument on behalf of the defendants.\n[31]\nIn applying s. 36(1) it is clear that I can look at the whole of the patent to see if the requisite information can be found in either the disclosures or the claims. This is clear from the wording of s. 36(1) itself which merely requires that the applicant describe \"in the specification\" the invention and its operation or use. The specification includes both the disclosures and the claims. The jurisprudence has confirmed this approach to s. 36(1) [see footnote 7]. While I have concluded that certain of the claims are invalid, for purposes of applying s. 36(1) I could have resorted to all of the claims. That will not be necessary, however, as I have concluded that the necessary description can be found in the disclosures and the valid claims.\n[32]\nThe jurisprudence also confirms that in applying s. 36(1) the court should not be too technical in its approach [see footnote 8]. As Duff, C.J.C., said in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a reasonable view of it, can be so read as to afford the inventor protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented, the court, as a rule, will endeavour to give effect to that construction.\"\nFurther, what I must ascertain is what the whole of the patent would have meant, at the date it issued, to a person skilled in the art [see footnote 10].\n[33]\nAs for the meaning of the phrase \"relative concentration of material\" expert witnesses for the defendants professed bewilderment as to its meaning. Mr. Strohl could not see where this material would come from. As I indicated in respect of the infringement issue, I interpret the evidence as a whole to support the view that insertion of a plug in one lumen prior to the forming of the tip, as is done by the defendants in the fabrication of their product, can create a \"concentration of material\". Mr. Strohl in his evidence described the Blake patent of 1972 as involving a dual lumen catheter in which, at the formation stage, a plastic plug is inserted in one lumen and a round wire in the other lumen. A tapered tip is then formed by a heated die which according to him \"at the same time causes the plastic plug to lose its identity and merge into the material of the catheter tube resulting in a thickening of the tip\". I am at a loss to know why this does not create what could be described as a \"relative concentration of material\", nor why a skilled workman reading the present patent in 1985 when it was issued would not understand that as one possible meaning. Mr. Martin, on examination for discovery, in describing the process used to make the defendants' catheters, said that when the plug is inserted in the second lumen and the catheter is then heated in a mold to form the conical tip, the tubing and the plug \"liquify and flow together\" to form a unitary structure. He further said that in making catheters with a glass mold, such processes \"tend to form a concentration of material and make a more rigid ... tip\". He said these techniques were known to him in 1975. Further, in respect of the modified version of their catheters which have been produced since March, 1987 where a plug is used to block off the lumen but does not extend as far as the tip, the formation of the tip creates a thickening of the wall of the catheter between the plug and the tip (some open space being first left in a former portion of the second lumen before this thickening commences). As he said, \"that thickening results from the material that is integral with the tip\". An expert witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal, Glenn L. Beall, of Gurnee, Illinois, President of Glenn Beall Engineering Incorporated which is a manufacturer inter alia of catheters, testified (transcript, pages 991-993) that he could readily achieve a concentration of material in the fabrication of such a tip by deforming some additional portion of tube material beyond the tip and displacing that to the tip area. Mr. Beall said that he understood \"relative concentration of material\" simply to mean that there would be more material in a certain area than elsewhere. I conclude that a skilled workman would have understood the term \"relative concentration of material\" to have such a meaning and further would have known possible sources of such material, such as an additional plug fused into the tube through heating or the displacement into this area of extra material from an additional portion of the tubing.\n[34]\nThe other major difficulty which the defendants assert with respect to this patent is that it does not make clear how the tip is to be formed: whether it is to be manufactured as a separate piece bonded onto the end of the dual lumen tube, or is to be integrally formed from the tube itself. The defendants say that the patent in this respect is ambiguous and confusing. At page 8, lines 9 to 16 of patent '508, part of the disclosures, it is stated:\n\"The tip 20 including the relative concentration of material 23 is easily molded and bonded or is integrally formed from the cylindrical tube 11 by the use of internal and external mandrels and the application of heat by any number of conventional means such as RF forming, thermal forming, or infrared forming.\"\nFurther, in the patent drawings as reproduced at the beginning of this judgment, in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 there is a horizontal line above the tip 20 at a point where the tip ceases to taper and the cylindrical tubing of uniform diameter begins. In figure 7, on the other hand, a portion of the cylindrical tubing and the tapered tip are depicted as one integral piece. Both Dr. Shaldon and Mr. Strohl testifying on behalf of the defendants said that they understood figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 to depict a separate tip bonded to the tube. Both were of the opinion that it would be dangerous to bond the tip to the tube as secure adhesion could not be assured, and it would be very harmful to a patient if a tip came loose during the use of the catheter. Dr. Uldall said that one could bond the tip \"face to face with the lumen\" but that he would \"worry about the end becoming disconnected\" and therefore he would not use such a catheter. Mr. Beall on the other hand said that it would be difficult but not impossible to bond a tip to the tube securely. Mr. Quinton, another catheter manufacturer, said that he was not prepared to agree that it would be impractical to bond the tip to the tube although for the particular manufacturing processes of his company it was preferable to use a separate tip with inserts as they do in the manufacture of the Mahurkar catheter. Mr. Beall, however, testified that reading the patent as a whole he believed it taught the use of an integrally formed tip. He said that although there might be some ambiguity in the less detailed figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 because of the horizontal line which traverses the catheter at the base of the tip, a skilled workman would know that figure 7 which is the more detailed drawing of the tip area should be determinative. I am satisfied from his evidence that figure 7 depicts an integrally formed tip. I do not believe that any of the defendants' witnesses really contradicted this although they found figure 7 inadequate because it does not clearly explain from where the \"relative concentration of material\" is to come.\n[35]\nCounsel for the defendants argued on the basis of this evidence that the patent teaches the use of a separate tip bonded face to face with the end of the dual lumen tubing, that such device would be dangerous for patients, and that therefore the invention described lacks utility; or that at least it is so ambiguous as to mislead a skilled workman into one possible implementation of the patent which would not serve the purpose stated in the patent. Counsel relied in this respect on the decision of my colleague Collier, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relevant principle is to be found in the decision of the Supreme Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  used in making electrocardiograms, etc. The claims described a cream \"composed of an aqueous emulsion\" which would contain, inter alia, \"1-10% of a highly ionizable salt ...\" It was contended that the patent did not meet the requirements of s. 36(1) of the Patent Act because this general language could include salts and solutions which might be corrosive to the skin. The Supreme Court rejected this contention because the addressee of a patent is a man skilled in the art [see footnote 13].\n\"... and the knowledge such a man is expected to possess is to be taken into consideration. To such a man it must be obvious that a cream for use with skin contact electrodes is not to be made up with ingredients that are toxic or irritating or are apt to stain or discolour the skin.\"\nIn the present case, even if Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 must be interpreted as depicting the separate bonded tip which is referred to in the disclosures as a possible design, the evidence was not clear that its use would be impossible. If it would be, this is a matter a skilled workman would know and he would not pursue this option. What the patent does is to provide a design for a dual lumen catheter with conical tip. It does not provide, nor do I think it needs to provide, manufacturing instructions. It shows the configuration required and the purposes are clear. I am satisfied that a skilled workman could take this patent and produce a catheter of that configuration, using his own knowledge to avoid constructions which would be dangerous. For the reasons which I have found infringement to exist, it is apparent that the defendants are manufacturing a catheter which incorporates the substance, and for that matter the text, of the patent. I have also indicated that I think the Mahurkar catheter manufactured by Quinton incorporates this substance even though for its own reasons the Quinton Corporation employs a manufacturing technique not referred to in the patent. In this respect the situation differs from that in the Consolboard case where the invention claimed was for a device which did not work: the complaint there was not that the patent described various devices, some of which would not work. In the present case the invention claimed is not the manufacturing process but the design and function of the catheter. As quoted above, the disclosures refer to the \"use of internal and external mandrels and the application of heat by any number of conventional means\". This is not expressed, nor is it claimed, as the invention, as the evidence disclosed that workable fabrication processes are known for the production of a catheter of this design. None of the expert witnesses denied that. I am satisfied that any skilled workman with a mind willing to understand could read this patent and proceed to the fabrication of a safe catheter of this design.\n[37]\nThe defendants also contended that the patent does not adequately disclose the material of which the tube and tip are to be made. It is true that the only reference in the patent to this matter is at page 8 of the disclosures where it is stated:\n\"It is readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that the tip 20 as shown in FIG. 7 is easily formed from thermo-plastic material.\"\nMr. Beall indicated that this would be sufficient to direct a reader to a \"family of materials\" of which many were available and in use in the 1980's. Some would be known to be unsuitable. While the passage quoted only refers to the material in the tip, it also refers to figure 7 which clearly depicts the tip and the tube as being integrally formed. This would, it appears to me, convey to the skilled workman that in accordance with figure 7 the whole catheter should be made of the same thermo-plastic material. It appears to me that further guidance in this respect could be found on page 4 of the disclosures where it is stated at lines 3 to 10:\n\"The catheter also has a uniform diameter along its entire length from its proximal end to the conical tapered tip. The tip guidance point is located at the center of the conical tip for uniform distribution of frictional resistance and minimization of insertion trauma and kinking. The conical tapered tip comprises a relative concentration of material to impart relative rigidity so that the tip functions as an effective dilator for soft tissue and veins.\"\nThe reference to \"kinking\" clearly implies a flexible tube and the reference to a \"relative concentration of material\" in the tip \"to impart relative rigidity\" implies that otherwise the tip would be of the same flexibility as the tube. Given also the number of thermoplastic percutaneous catheters on the market in September, 1985 when this patent issued, I find it hard to believe that a skilled workman would have difficulty in understanding what kind of material is to be used both in the tip and in the tube of the catheter. The claims, of course, assert no invention with respect to the kind of material to be employed other than with respect to its two \"D\" configuration.\n[38]\nThe other objections pleaded with respect to s. 36(1) of the Patent Act not having been argued, and they having no apparent substance in my view, I find that the defendants have not established invalidity of the patent by reason of a failure to describe adequately the invention or any workable invention.\nClaims Broader than the Invention Described\n[39]\nIn their particulars of objections filed with their statement of defence, the defendants alleged that the invention disclosed in the patent in question includes the following essential features:\n\"(a) a dual lumen catheter having two semi-circular or D-shaped lumens;\n\"(b) one lumen being shorter than the other;\n\"(c) a conical tapered tip at the distal end comprising 'a relative concentration of material' to impart relative rigidity to the tip; and\n\"(d) a tip guidance point at the centre of the conical tip.\"\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the affidavits sworn by the defendants' expert witnesses characterized the invention in almost identical language. The defendants contend that none of the claims of the patent is limited to a combination comprising all of these features. Accordingly each of them claims more than is disclosed in the specifications and more than the plaintiff invented and is thus invalid. It is also alleged that for the same reason they describe products which would not have the utility contemplated in the disclosures. I have already dealt with the utility question above.\n[40]\nThe plaintiff did not specifically take issue with these four elements identified by the defendants as the essentials of the invention and I believe they adequately encompass the invention revealed in the disclosures. In my view claims 7, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19, do have limitations to all of these features. It appears to me for example that claim 14 adequately limits the invention claimed to one containing these features. It commences by describing \"a double lumen catheter comprising an elongated cylindrical tube including a planar axial divider bisecting said cylindrical tube into first and second lumens\". I fail to see why this does not adequately describe \"a dual lumen catheter having two semi-circular or D-shaped lumens\". If one takes an elongated cylindrical tube and puts in it a \"planar axial divider bisecting\" that tube, one surely ends up with two lumens of equal size which are D-shaped. I should think this would be adequately clear to any one except, perhaps, a patent agent. Claim 14 goes on to state that the first lumen extends from the proximal end to the distal end of the tube and the second lumen extends from the proximal end \"to a second opening in the side of cylindrical tube, said second lumen terminating at said second opening ...\" I am unable to comprehend how that fails to describe a catheter with one lumen which is shorter than the other. If the first lumen extends from one end of the catheter to the other and the second lumen extends from one end to a hole in the side of the lumen at which point it terminates, I fail to understand how the second lumen can be other than shorter than the first lumen. Claim 14 also goes on to speak of \"a relative concentration of material extending axially from the second opening to the distal end of said cylindrical tube, the distal end of said cylindrical tube having a smooth conical tapered tip\". Again, it appears to me that this adequately limits the claim to a device with the features described in item (c) as defined above by the defendants. It is true that the claim does not explain the purpose of the relative concentration of material (i.e. \"to impart relative rigidity\" to the tip as stated in the disclosures) but that is surely unnecessary to effect the limitation of the scope of the claim to that which has been invented. With respect to item (d) identified by the defendants, \"a tip guidance point at the centre of the conical tip\", it is true that claim 14 does not employ these words which are similar to those found in the disclosures. I do not think, however, that it would be very difficult for a skilled workman reading this claim to infer that that is the intention. The claim refers to the \"first lumen extending ... to a first opening at the distal end of said cylindrical tube ...\" It goes on to refer to \"the distal end of said cylindrical tube having a smooth conical tapered tip ...\" When one is dealing with devices of this size, and given the importance of having as free a flow of blood as possible from the first lumen through the tip, the most natural interpretation which would be put on this language is that the opening would be as large as the tip would permit which would mean that it would have to be essentially centered in the tip. If a skilled workman had any lingering doubts about this they would surely be dispelled if he read claim 17 which describes a device such as claimed in 14 except that the opening in the tip \"is eccentric with respect to the axis of the conical tapered tip\". In other words, as claim 17 describes a tip with a hole which is not centered, it contrasts with claim 14. Surely a reasonable skilled workman would then read claim 14 as describing a tip wherein the hole is centered. Although I have elsewhere considered claim 17 to be invalid I see no reason why it could not be read by a skilled workman in order to clarify the scope of claim 14. In any event I believe that claim 14 is adequately circumscribed in this respect.\n[41]\nFor similar reasons I find that claim 7, because it incorporates claim 1, involves the four essential features defined by the defendants. Claim 1 embodies features (b) and (d) and part of (c), whereas claim 7 embodies features (a) and the remainder of (c). Claims 15, 16, 18, and 19 incorporate claim 14 which I have already held to include the essential features, and none of the additional matters claimed in 15, 16, 18, and 19 are inconsistent with the four essential features.\n[42]\nOn the other hand I find the remainder of the claims in issue not to be sufficiently limited to the essential features of this invention as drawn from the disclosures. Claim 1 by itself lacks features (a) and the \"relative concentration of material\" referred to in feature (c). Claims 2 to 6, 8 to 10 and 13 are dependent on 1 and do not make up for its deficiencies. Claim 12 appears to be inconsistent with feature (d) and is therefore claiming something not described in the disclosures, as does, for similar reasons, claim 17.\n[43]\nClaim 21, the first of the third group of claims, also lacks features (a) and part of (c) (there being no reference to \"a relative concentration of material\"). None of the dependent claims 22 to 25 make up for these deficiencies.\n[44]\nAs noted earlier, claims 11, 20, and 26 are not in issue.\n[45]\nClaims 1 to 6, 8 to 10, 12, 13, 17, and 21 to 25 are therefore invalid because they claim more than is described in the disclosures.\nConclusions\n[46]\nI therefore find that there has been infringement of the patent and that the patent is valid except for certain claims. It was agreed at the trial that I would hear counsel with respect to the form of relief and to costs before a formal judgment is entered. In preparation for this hearing I would request counsel for the plaintiff to draft a formal judgment for consideration, and provide such draft to the court and counsel for the defendants prior to the hearing.\nAction allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\nFootnotes\n1.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, at 10 (F.C.A.).

  "full_text_en": "[0]\nIntroduction\n\n[1]\nStrayer, J.\n: This is an action for infringement of the plaintiff's Canadian patent 1,193,508 issued September 17, 1985 with respect to a \"smooth bore double lumen catheter\". The disclosures of the patent describe a use of this catheter in hemodialysis (the removal of blood from a patient suffering a kidney dysfunction, the cleansing and return of that blood) by means of insertion of the catheter into a large vein. The catheter, having two \"lumens\" or passages in it, carries away from the vein through one passage blood containing toxins, and returns to that vein through the other passage the cleansed blood once it has passed through a dialysis machine. Reproduced on p. 51 are the drawings from the patent in issue. In figure 1 can be seen, at the proximal end of the catheter, tube 17 which carries away the soiled blood from the catheter, and tube 16 which returns the clean blood from the dialysis machine.\nDRAWING OF DEFENDANTS' PRODUCT\n[Diagram omitted. See printed volume.]\nDRAWING FROM PATENT IN ISSUE\n[Diagram omitted. See printed volume.]\n\n[2]\nThe plaintiff is a physician employed by the Division of Nephrology in the Department of Medicine, Cook County Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, and an Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Health Sciences, Chicago Medical School.\n\n[3]\nAccording to the statement of agreed facts, the defendant Vas-Cath is an Ontario corporation which manufactures and sells in Canada double lumen catheters known as VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000. Reproduced below are some drawings from a patent application filed by the defendant Vas-Cath on May 24, 1984.\n\n[4]\nAccording to Geoffrey S. Martin, President and 50% owner of Vas-Cath who was its representative at the examination for discovery held on November 13, 1986, the intent was that such drawings should cover the catheters then being manufactured by Vas-Cath. Subsequent to that examination for discovery, in March, 1987 Vas-Cath made some changes to the design of the VACCESS 3500 and of the VACCESS 4000. The only material alteration is described in a continuation of the examination for discovery held on November 20, 1987 and is marked on trial Exhibit P-29. The relevant change as indicated by Mr. Martin involves a gap or a space in the material marked as 56 and 58 in figure 3 above, the gap commencing at about midway between the numbers 56 and 46 and ending slightly to the right of the number 5 all as they appear in figure 3. It was also agreed in the statement of agreed facts that the defendant Gambro Canada Ltd. is the exclusive distributor for this kind of product of Vas-Cath throughout the world except in the U.S.A. It was further agreed that Vas-Cath has been manufacturing and selling in Canada the VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 double lumen catheters without any licence from the plaintiff and intends to continue to do so, and that Gambro has similarly distributed these catheters in Canada and intends to continue to do so.\n\n[5]\nThe defendants deny infringement, and as is usual in such cases deny the validity of the plaintiff's patent 1,193,508. They attack the validity on the grounds that the plaintiff is not the first inventor and that before the plaintiff applied for his patent (the priority date being August 15, 1984 the date of application for the corresponding U.S. patent) products embodying the same alleged invention had been made available to the public; that the plaintiff's application should have been rejected under s. 63(2) of the Patent Act because the defendant Vas-Cath had already obtained Canadian patent number 1,167,727 issued on May 22, 1984 for the same invention; that the plaintiff's invention had been anticipated by an earlier patent; that it was obvious having regard to the prior art; that it does not comply with the requirements of s. 36(1) of the Patent Act; and that the claims are wider than the invention disclosed.\n\n[6]\nPursuant to an order of this court made on November 18, 1986 any assessment of damages or profits arising from infringement is to be the subject of a reference under rule 500, should I find liability. I therefore need not deal with questions of quantum.\nInfringement\n\n[7]\nI have concluded that the catheters VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 sold by the defendants infringe at least certain of the claims of the plaintiff's patent. I find infringement of claims 7, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. Claims 11, 20, and 26 are not in issue.\n\n[8]\nThe reasons for which I find infringement of these claims are well illustrated in Exhibit P11-38, part of the affidavit of the plaintiff testifying as an expert. He displays there side by side the drawings which Vas-Cath admits depict their product and the text of the claims, demonstrating by arrows where the various features described in the claims can be found in the drawing. I have reviewed this material and accept it as demonstrating infringement of the claims to which I have referred.\n\n[9]\nThe principal contention of the defendants with respect to infringement has been that their product does not involve a \"relative concentration of material extending axially from the second opening to the distal end of said cylindrical tube ...\" as referred to in claims 7 and 14. In figure 7 of the patent in issue, reproduced above, this \"concentration of material\" is depicted at 23. The defendants contend that as so described in the patent, it can refer only to material which is derived from the double lumen tubing itself or from a projection from a separate tip inserted into the second (shorter) lumen. By contrast, they point out (and this is not disputed) that their catheters use a separate plug of the same material as the lumens, the plug being inserted into the second lumen prior to formation of the tip, it appearing in figure 3 of the drawing of their product reproduced above as 56 and 58. Further, they point out that in the revised models of their catheters produced since March of 1987 there is a shorter plug blocking off the second lumen, then going toward the tip an open space (part of the original second lumen), and then solid material where the second lumen used to be, caused by the forming of the tip. Thus they contend that there is no \"relative concentration of material as contemplated by claim 14. I find this contention unconvincing. First, I believe that there is textual infringement of the patent because the words \"relative concentration of material\" in their normal usage do not as such imply the source of the \"material\". I see no reason why the \"material\" may not come from an extraneous source and be added to the material of the lumens to increase the \"concentration\" in a certain area. There was no expert evidence which clearly indicated to me why the ordinary meaning of the words should not apply in this case. In any event I am satisfied that there is substantive infringement by the defendants' catheters even though they insert a plug in one lumen to strengthen the tip instead of providing such thickening through integral moulding of the material already in the dual lumen tubing. As stated recently by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords [see footnote 1], a court should in interpreting a claim give it a \"purposive construction\" and not interpret it to exclude minor variants which to the knowledge of the inventor and the readers of the patent could have no material effect upon the way in which the invention works. That approach is clearly applicable here. It is clear from the evidence that the purpose of the \"relative concentration of material\" is to strengthen the tip of the catheter so that it will not bend unduly while being pushed through human tissue. The evidence satisfies me that this purpose would be evident to any one skilled in the art in reading the patent. To the achievement of this purpose, no one has demonstrated to me what possible difference it could make whether the concentration of material is integrally formed from the dual lumen tubing or whether it is provided by similar material in the form of a plug inserted into one of the lumens. There was evidence that when, so inserted, heat is applied, the effect is to meld the plug with the surrounding material. This surely results in a concentration of material in the area where the plug was placed. More importantly, the purpose of using this technique, and its net effect, is the same as if the extra material had been found in the tubing itself through melting and compaction of extra tubing material at the tip end. The use of a plug is a mere detail which does not save the defendants from infringement of the patent [see footnote 2]. For the same reasons, the innovation of a gap in the plug area as found in the new models of VACCESS 3500 and VACCESS 4000 produced since March, 1987 does not save those devices from infringing. Expert witnesses including Dr. Robert Uldall and Mr. Glen Beall testified that this variation would make no functional difference to the catheter. I am therefore satisfied that it also infringes in substance the plaintiff's patent.\n\n[10]\nThe defendants also contended that there was no infringement of claim 17 because it describes a catheter as claimed in claim 14:\n\"... wherein the first opening in the distal end of said cylindrical tube is eccentric with respect to the axis of the conical tapered tip.\"\n\"Eccentric\" is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as describing something which is \"not centrally placed\" or whose axis is not centrally placed. I therefore understand this claim to describe a tip in which the opening for the entry to the first lumen is off center of the tip. The defendants contend, and this appears to be the case, that the lumen opening in their tips is centered. For this reason I am not finding any infringement with claim 17, but this does not mean that the defendants have not infringed the other claims to which I have referred. At best, the precise location of the hole in the end of the tip is a minor variation which, as I understand the evidence, can have no serious effect on the way the catheter operates. A more general and important claim is claim 15 which requires that:\n\"... the apex of said conical tip is substantially aligned with the axis of said cylindrical tube.\"\nIn other words, this claim requires that the tip be essentially in the center point of the tube. According to the evidence this will facilitate insertion through human tissue. It is only within the diameter of that tip that the opening hold could be either centered or eccentric to the axis of the tube. Such variations must, by their nature, be minuscule and there was no evidence that a centered or eccentric position of the opening in the end of the conical tip would significantly affect the insertion of the catheter over a wire in accordance with the Seldinger technique. Claim 15 aptly describes the configuration of the defendants' products. The fact that they have not adopted the variation described in claim 17 does not exempt them from liability for infringement as they have appropriated the substance of the plaintiff's patent as set out in the claims to which I have referred.\n\n[11]\nAs will be explained below, I have found the remaining claims to be invalid and therefore will not analyze whether any of them are infringed by the defendants' products.\nPriority of Invention\n\n[12]\nI have concluded that the plaintiff, Doctor Mahurkar, was the inventor of the dual lumen subclavian catheter as described in the patent in issue and that he was therefore the first person to know of or use it. I find the following to be the salient facts. In 1977 Dr. Mahurkar had applied for, and on January 16, 1979 had obtained, U.S. patent 4,134,402 for a \"double lumen hemodialysis catheter\". This was actually a double lumen rigid needle, cylindrical in shape but divided internally by a septum which created two equal-sized \"D\"-shaped or semi-circular lumens for carrying away and returning blood. This needle would, as I understand it, normally be used for hemodialysis through insertion into a fistula, probably in the arm or leg. The needle did not have a tapered tip. The tip was bevelled, with one lumen continuing to the tip and the other lumen being cut away some distance back from the tip with its end open at that point. In the summer of 1979 Dr. Mahurkar conceived the idea of a plastic double lumen catheter and started to seek appropriate tubing from manufacturers. He finally obtained some suitable samples from Teal Plastics Inc. of Baraboo, Wisconsin. On December 22, 1980 he ordered a quantity of such double lumen extrusion from the company. In January of 1981 through experimentation at his home in Chicago in the development of a suitable tip for such tubing, he produced a few tapered tips which are now Exhibits P11-16. In April, 1981 and in approximately June, 1981 he had conversations with Mr. Wayne Quinton, Chairman of the Board of Quinton Instrument Company of Seattle, Washington. Mr. Quinton, whose company makes various medical products, was interested in the idea of dual lumen catheters for hemodialysis and he was intrigued by Dr. Mahurkar's dual lumen needle as covered by the U.S. '402 patent. While in his evidence he was somewhat unsure as to when Dr. Mahurkar first showed him the dual lumen tubing with tapered tips which are now Exhibits P11-16, it seems clear from the events that followed that this happened either in these meetings of April and June or in the subsequent months of 1981 when discussions were going on between Mr. Quinton and Dr. Mahurkar which culminated in a licence agreement being signed on February 1, 1982. (See Exhibit P-2, page 123 ff.) This licence agreement refers only to U.S. patent '402 but involved the obtaining, and grant, of a licence from Dr. Mahurkar to Quinton Instrument Company of the right to manufacture, use, sell and distribute, inter alia, a double lumen needle and a double lumen subclavian catheter. Pursuant to this agreement, the Quinton Instrument Company developed a double lumen subclavian catheter into a commercially successful product. In doing so Quinton developed a tapered tip which, though functioning the same as those subsequently depicted in the patent in issue, is fabricated separately with insertions which fit into the end of double lumen tubing to produce a product which externally is virtually identical to the catheter depicted in Canadian patent '508 (the patent in issue). A prototype of this catheter was displayed at a meeting of the American Society of Nephrology in Chicago in December, 1982. While it was not at that time ready for market it was displayed as a commercial product by Quinton at the American Society of Artificial Internal Organs meeting in Toronto in April, 1983. On both occasions it was seen by Geoffrey Martin, the President of the defendant Vas-Cath. By June, 1983 it was put on the market by Quinton under the name of the \"Mahurkar Catheter\". It continues to be sold under that name. Several million dollars (U.S.) worth of this catheter have been sold since June, 1983.\n\n[13]\nI am satisfied from the evidence that it was the work and discoveries of Dr. Mahurkar in the development of a usable dual lumen tubing and the design and placing thereon of a tapered tip which enabled the Quinton Instrument Company to put this catheter on the market. Mr. Quinton himself acknowledged that the development of the commercial product flowed from the agreement, particularly with reference to the exclusive licence granted by paragraph 1.2 with respect to a \"double lumen subclavian catheter\". He referred to the transfer, pursuant to the agreement, of inventory in the hands of Dr. Mahurkar. The company agreed under the licence agreement to refer to such products by the name of Dr. Mahurkar and it has done so with respect to its product (P-7). It advertises its product as the Mahurkar Catheter (P-8, P-9). The fact that before going into commercial production Quinton developed a separately moulded tip, rather than using an integrally moulded tip as Dr. Mahurkar did in his original prototypes, takes nothing away from Dr. Mahurkar's invention. Mr. Quinton explained in evidence that for his particular plant it was more economical to mould the tip separately when undertaking production in commercial quantities. This does not alter the fact that the design was Dr. Mahurkar's and that the \"Mahurkar Catheter\" sold by Quinton since June, 1983 incorporates the substance of Dr. Mahurkar's invention.\n\n[14]\nDr. Mahurkar subsequently applied on August 15, 1984 for a U.S. patent on a \"smooth bore double lumen catheter\" and made a counterpart Canadian application on August 28, 1984. Canadian patent 1,193,508, the patent in issue, was subsequently issued on September 17, 1985 as a result of this application.\n\n[15]\nAs the defendants have asserted that Geoffrey Martin, the President of the defendant Vas-Cath, made this invention, I will set out briefly my findings with respect to the activities of Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin commenced the Vas-Cath business in 1977 and the company was incorporated in January, 1979. From the outset Vas-Cath specialized in manufacturing catheters. Some time in 1978 Mr. Martin met Dr. Robert Uldall, the Director of Hemodialysis at Toronto Western Hospital and Associate Professor, Division of Nephrology, Toronto Western Hospital. Mr. Martin acting under Dr. Uldall's direction developed both a single lumen catheter and a double lumen catheter for dialysis. The double lumen catheter was co-axial, that is it consisted of one tube inside another. As a result of disagreements, Dr. Uldall and Vas-Cath discontinued collaboration in November, 1979. Vas-Cath continued to produce a dual lumen co-axial catheter thereafter. Dr. Mahurkar, who lives in Chicago, had heard of Vas-Cath as a commercial manufacturer of catheters and contacted that firm by telephone sometime after he developed the tips found in Exhibits P11-16, to discuss the possibility of it making some tips for him. After contacting Vas-Cath by telephone, he sent to it on April 2, 1981 some seventy pieces of his double lumen catheter tubing, these being sent \"for forming a smooth tip and bevel satisfactory for penetration test\". (See P3-6). On April 21, 1981 Vas-Cath returned to Dr. Mahurkar sixteen of these pieces of tubing, fourteen of which had tips. (See P-2, page 96). None of these tips were of the tapered design which is the subject of the patent in issue. As noted above Martin saw the prototype of the Mahurkar catheter as produced by Quinton in December, 1982. He saw it again as a product then commercially available in April, 1983. He says that he developed the catheter with the tip which Vas-Cath uses in its product during the summer and fall of 1983. The first sales of the Vas-Cath catheter of the type allegedly infringing the plaintiff's patent occurred in January, 1984. On May 24, 1984 Martin applied for a patent for his catheter, and such patent was issued on March 31, 1987. It is common ground that the claims of this Canadian patent 1,219,785 describe an invention covered by the claims of the plaintiff's patent 1,193,508.\n\n[16]\nIt will be apparent that in finding the facts as I have, I have preferred the evidence of the plaintiff to that of Mr. Martin on behalf of Vas-Cath. The evidence of the plaintiff as to the time of the invention was corroborated in important respects by documents and the evidence of other witnesses concerning his search for a manufacturer of tubing meeting his specifications, his discussions with other persons, and the course of his cooperation with Mr. Quinton leading to the production and sale of the \"Mahurkar Catheter\". On the other hand Mr. Martin says that he got the idea for such a catheter on March 21, 1978 while at Boynton Beach, Florida. In support of this contention he identified drawings on the back of Exhibit D-8 which he says he made at that time. These drawings show three possible designs for a double lumen catheter one of which appears to be similar to that of the plaintiff. I am aware of no other evidence which corroborates the date or authorship of this design. Nor was there any evidence that he developed this design into a workable product until after the Mahurkar catheter was actually on the market. I am further inclined to believe that Dr. Mahurkar was the inventor rather than Mr. Martin because Dr. Mahurkar had the requisite skills to create an appropriate design and Mr. Martin did not. In expert evidence given by both Dr. Mahurkar and Dr. Uldall it was said that the design of such a catheter requires extensive medical knowledge, particularly that related to the behaviour of blood, as well as knowledge of the technology of hypodermic needle and catheter manufacture. Dr. Mahurkar's training and experience equipped him for this task. By contrast, Mr. Martin's academic training is in music. He said on examination for discovery that with respect to medical supplies he was\n\"... self-taught by examining U.S.C.I. catheters and slicing them apart and seeing how they were put together; knowing what they were used for; and researching new types of products.\"\nWhile he no doubt has developed a certain amount of technical skill in the manufacture of catheters I have concluded, from the foregoing and other evidence, that with respect to this catheter he was more opportunist than inventor.\n\n[17]\nAs I have concluded that Dr. Mahurkar is the inventor of the invention disclosed in his patent '508, and that it was not known or used by any other person including Mr. Martin before he invented it, all of the defendants' pleas of invalidity based on paragraph 28(1)(a) and s. 63(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, must be dismissed.\n\n[18]\nIn addition, the defendants rely on s. 63(2) of the Patent Act which provides:\n\"63(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 43, an application for a patent for an invention for which a patent has already issued under this Act shall be rejected unless the applicant, within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner, commences an action to set aside the prior patent, so far as it covers the invention in question, but if such action is so commenced and diligently prosecuted, the application shall not be deemed to have been abandoned unless the applicant fails to proceed upon it within a reasonable time after the action has been finally disposed of.\"\nThey contend that since Vas-Cath had applied for a patent for a dual lumen cannula on November 26, 1981, and thereby obtained Canadian patent 1,167,727 issued May 22, 1984, there was a patent already issued for the same invention as was contained in the plaintiff's application of August 28, 1984, for the patent in issue. (Although the defendants' pleadings refer to patent 1,116,727 I assume in the context that patent 1,167,727 is intended). Thus it is contended that since the Commissioner did not fix a time within which the plaintiff as applicant for the patent should have commenced action against Vas-Cath as holder of patent '727, the plaintiff's application should have been rejected and his patent must therefore be treated as invalid. I am not satisfied from the evidence that Vas-Cath's earlier patent '727 is for the same invention as that covered by the plaintiff's subsequent patent '508. While involving the use of the same kind of dual lumen cylindrical tubing bisected internally by a septum, it does not have a smoothly tapered conical point. One lumen terminates in an opening at the distal end, but the other lumen terminates in an inclined plane closing off the second lumen before it reaches the distal end. There was insufficient evidence to satisfy me that this should be regarded as the same invention as that described in the plaintiff's patent '508. It is interesting to note, however, that as a result of the exchange of letters and materials between the plaintiff and Vas-Cath in April, 1981, Vas-Cath retained in its possession many pieces of the dual lumen tubing which the plaintiff had developed. After a meeting in Toronto on June 30, 1981, at which the plaintiff and Vas-Cath were unable to come to an agreement about the manufacture of plaintiff's catheter, the defendant Vas-Cath lost no time in seeking the patent for the kind of catheter described in its patent '727. On July 6th Mr. Martin sent instructions to his patent attorney with respect to a patent application. On July 24, 1981, Martin applied for a U.S. patent equivalent to patent '727, and the application for the Canadian patent was then made on November 26, 1981. This patent clearly utilizes the kind of dual lumen tubing developed by Dr. Mahurkar.\nAnticipation\n\n[19]\nThe defendants rely solely on the Pfarre patent, a U.S. patent issued in 1882, as anticipating the patent in issue. The Pfarre patent describes a catheter of soft rubber rounded, not tapered, at the end. It has within it two channels or lumens which are not of equal size. In one embodiment one of the lumens does lead to an opening at the distal end while the other lumen receives or discharges fluid through a hole in the side of the tube.\n\n[20]\nThe test for anticipation is very rigorous. For a prior document or patent to anticipate a patent whose validity is attacked, the former must be so clear and so apposite as inevitably to lead skilled workmen to the latter [see footnote 3]. I find that the Pfarre patent does not meet these requirements. There was no evidence that the Pfarre patent was ever implemented in a usable product and as a \"paper anticipation\" it must be viewed very strictly. The evidence from the expert witnesses was, of course, conflicting. Taking that evidence into account, and reading the two patents I am unable to conclude that the Pfarre patent would have inevitably led a skilled workman to the invention depicted in patent '508. For example, the Pfarre patent says nothing of the importance of having two D-shaped lumens of similar size. This aspect of the invention claimed is stated in claim 14 of patent '508 where it refers to \"a planar axial divider bisecting said cylindrical tube into first and second lumens ...\" Claim 7 states a similar requirement. A divider bisecting a tube must of necessity create two D-shaped lumens of similar size. The evidence has demonstrated that from the standpoint of the fluid dynamics of blood this configuration is very important. The drawing in Pfarre in fact depicts two lumens of quite unequal size. Further, the specifications say nothing as to the shape of the distal end of the catheter although the drawings depict a hemispherical end. Claim 14 of patent '508 calls for a \"smooth conical tapered tip that smoothly merges with the cylindrical surface of said cylindrical tube ...\" Claim 1 (as adopted by claim 7) has a similar requirement. It is apparent to me from the disclosures and the evidence that this is a very important feature of this catheter because of the need to insert it through the skin and into a vein, notwithstanding the evidence of one expert, Dr. Shaldon, that the difference for these purposes between a conical and hemispherical shape would be \"immaterial\". Further, claims 7 and 14 require \"a relative concentration of material\" near the tip to add rigidity for these purposes. The Pfarre patent says nothing of this requirement. Quite apart from these important differences between the actual devices, a skilled person reading it would not \"in every case and without possibility of error be led to\" [see footnote 4] the invention in issue. The whole stated purpose of Pfarre is different: it is an invention to be used for flushing out body cavities by means of insertions through existing orifices. As the specifications state:\n\"This invention is for use in washing, bathing, cooling, or warming and cleansing the bladder, stomach, ears, nose, rectum, and other diseased cavities or wounds of the human or animal body.\"\nAs the inventor states at a later point:\n\"I have experimented for some time, and have at last succeeded in producing an instrument that will be soft and easy of introduction, so that patients may be educated by their physicians to wash their bladder, stomach, &c., without pain and with ease.\"\nBy contrast, the disclosures of the patent in issue clearly show that it deals with a double lumen catheter designed for effecting the exchange of blood for purposes of hemodialysis, by means of penetration of the skin and blood vessels. Both Dr. Mahurkar and one of the defendants' witnesses, Dr. Shaldon, testifying as experts, said that Pfarre was designed for completely different purposes. The evidence satisfies me that the difference in purpose of the two devices is so material that Pfarre could not be seen as a source of clear direction for someone trying to devise a percutaneous dual lumen hemodialysis catheter. Such a connection between the two could only, I fear, be apparent to a patent agent or his computer. It is certainly curious that if this 1882 patent provided all the necessary information it took ninety-nine years for anyone to produce the kind of device depicted in the patent in issue. I appreciate, of course, that in the rarefied world of patents, such a banal observation is legally irrelevant to the question of whether an earlier patent is an anticipation of a later patent.\n\n[21]\nI therefore find that the invention in patent '508 was not anticipated by the Pfarre patent.\nObviousness\n\n[22]\nWhile obviousness may be established by demonstrating that through a variety of information available to the \"inventor\" from diverse sources the \"invention\" should have been obvious to him and therefore was not truly an \"invention\", this principle must be applied with great caution. As Hugessen, J., said on behalf of the Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy.\"\nIn the present case I am particularly mindful of his observation at page 295:\n\"Every invention is obvious after it has been made, and to no one more so than an expert in the field. Where the expert has been hired for the purpose of testifying, his infallible hindsight is even more suspect. It is so easy, once the teaching of a patent is known, to say, 'I could have done that'; before the assertion can be given any weight, one must have a satisfactory answer to the question, 'Why didn't you?'\"\n\n[23]\nWhile there was, of course, conflicting expert evidence on whether at the time Dr. Mahurkar made his invention it would have been obvious to a skilled technician in the art, I am satisfied on balance that the defendants have not met the burden of proof which lies on them to establish obviousness. I have given the most weight to the evidence of Dr. Uldall and Dr. Mahurkar. They are both medical specialists in this area who had both been engaged in the search for a device which would function for the purposes, and with the success, of the device covered by the patent in issue. Both make it clear in their evidence that there was a recognized problem - the need to have a more satisfactory dual lumen catheter to facilitate continuous hemodialysis - on which various people were working. In other words, the solution was not obvious. While Dr. Mahurkar is of course an interested party and his expert evidence must be viewed with some caution, Dr. Uldall has no interest at stake and his evidence was to the same effect. He was indeed a most persuasive witness. He is generally credited with introducing the technique of using a catheter in the subclavian vein for purposes of dialysis. He invented a single lumen catheter for this purpose and then a co-axial double lumen catheter. Before his co-axial double lumen catheter had really enjoyed wide-spread sales, however, the Mahurkar catheter as manufactured and sold by Quinton had come on the market. Dr. Uldall testified that he immediately recognized that the Mahurkar catheter was superior to his own. He said that when Dr. Mahurkar first showed him privately some of his early prototype catheters, Dr. Uldall was doubtful that they would work because he felt that the inlet holes on the side of the catheter, intended to allow the passage of blood into the inlet lumen, would become blocked by adhesion to the side of the blood vessel. In fact this proved not to be the case. He also recognized the superiority of the double-\"D\" tubing over his co-axial design but such a structure had not occurred to him for this kind of catheter. If the invention was not obvious to Dr. Uldall, it would not have been obvious to a mere skilled by unimaginative technician.\n\n[24]\nAgainst this evidence that the solution was far from obvious, the defendants produced two experts: Clair Strohl and Dr. Stanley Shaldon. Strohl has the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering. He has many years of experience in the engineering and production of medical devices including those for blood processing and handling. After working for various manufacturers of these products he is now an independent engineering consultant \"in the medical device area and, in particular ... as it relates to the application of plastics and medical devices\". He did not precisely say that in 1981 the Mahurkar design would have been obvious to him. He said that if in 1979 he had been given a double-\"D\" lumen plastic tube and asked to put a tip on it suitable for percutaneous insertation by the Seldinger technique he thinks he would have ended up with a conical tapered tip having one lumen open to the tip and the other closed with access through holes in the side of the catheter. This in my view does not amount to evidence that the device conceived by Dr. Mahurkar was obvious. It was Dr. Mahurkar who had made to his specifications the double-\"D\" flexible thermoplastic tubing and it was he who concluded that a conical tip of a certain design with one lumen open at the tip and the other lumen open at the side of the catheter would function best. Mr. Strohl did not say that he would have had this idea but only that if asked to make such a device with appropriate instructions as to the end product required, he could have made it. Apart from this Mr. Strohl in his affidavit analyzed a lengthy list of prior art pleaded by the defendants in this action. He prepared an inventory of features of the patent which could be found in one form or another in some of the prior art. I find his evidence unconvincing on the question of obviousness.\n\n[25]\nDr. Shaldon, who is Head of the Research Section of the Department of Nephrology at the University Hospital in Nimes, France is unquestionably a medical authority of renown who is responsible for important advances in techniques for hemodialysis particularly with respect to percutaneous catheters. He too in his affidavit said that if he had been aware of double-\"D\" flexible material suitable for percutaneous use in a catheter he would have had no problems in forming a conical tip. He refers however to forming a conical tip \"similar to the one which I formed on my catheter shown in Schedule 'H' hereto\". Schedule \"H\", as I understand it, depicts a conical tube which is not smoothly tapered on one plane as is Dr. Mahurkar's, and moreover it is fixed on a single lumen catheter. Further, he said that he could achieve this with the double-\"D\" flexible material \"if I had wanted to make use of it\". It was clear from Dr. Shaldon's evidence that he is quite sceptical about the use of double lumen catheters generally, because he feels that as they are normally larger than a single lumen catheter extra trauma is caused to the patient by their insertion. He expressed doubts that this additional trauma is justified by the advantage of the continuous flow of blood in and out as permitted by a dual lumen catheter, as compared to the alternating flow which is employed when dialysis is done through a single lumen catheter. In part, then, his evidence must be seen as somewhat similar to Mr. Strohl's, that is he could have produced some sort of tip on a double lumen catheter if somebody had given him the catheter. In part it suggests that it would not have occurred to him to use a double lumen catheter for this purpose and therefore he would never have undertaken to make such a tip. Further, the kind of tip which he said he could make was not, in point of fact, the kind of tip required on a dual lumen catheter. It must also be observed that while he described himself as a \"medical bricoleur\", he is an expert in this field and not merely an unimaginative skilled workman.\n\n[26]\nI have reviewed the prior art at some length and I do not find it to demonstrate that Dr. Mahurkar's invention was obvious. As Mr. Strohl has demonstrated in his affidavit, one can find features here and there common to the patent in issue in various pieces of the prior art. In some cases the commonality is established only through the use of very general terms of description. I have rejected at the outset items 1.I, 1.J, and 1.K, of the schedule of prior art pleaded by the defendants in their particulars of objection. As I have found the invention date to have been some time in January, 1981 these items, all of which are dated after that time, can form no part of the prior art. As for the rest, none of them can be used for precisely the purpose for which the Mahurkar catheter is designed. (In this respect I am satisfied that I can look to the whole of the specifications of the patent in determining the purpose of the invention). Some of the prior art items are not intended for nor are they suitable for the transmission of blood. Most of them do not have lumens of equal size or \"D\"-shaped lumens. Most of them have no conical tapered tip. As noted before, Mr. Strohl did not go so far as to say that the design of a catheter and tip such as that of Dr. Mahurkar would have been obvious to him from these items of prior art. He only points out that one can find features of the Mahurkar device in such art, but such features are never found in one place nor are they designed and combined in a way suitable for percutaneous subclavian insertion of a catheter for purposes of hemodialysis.\n\n[27]\nIn reviewing the prior art I have also been persuaded by counsel for the plaintiff that an objective test should be applied to determine whether the hypothetical skilled workman in the art could be reasonably assumed to have knowledge of such prior art. There appears to be adequate authority in the jurisprudence [see footnote 6] for such a test. No evidence was produced by the defendants to show that the ordinary skilled workman should be assumed to have been aware of all of this prior art. Frankly I find it difficult to believe that several of the items of prior art would have been present to the mind of the ordinary skilled workman in 1981.\n\n[28]\nI am further satisfied from the evidence of its commercial success that Dr. Mahurkar's invention was not obvious. For reasons which I have set out above, I am satisfied that the Quinton product known as the \"Mahurkar Catheter\" incorporates the substance of Dr. Mahurkar's invention. Mr. Quinton testified as to the rapid acceptance of this product on the market and the considerable sales which it has enjoyed since its introduction in June of 1983. Some sales figures are set out in P6 and P10 and while there may be some debate over the precise sales attributable to the Mahurkar Catheter, it is clear that these have amounted to several million dollars (U.S.) during the four years following the introduction of this product. Both Dr. Uldall and Dr. Shaldon agreed that the dual lumen catheter of this configuration (whether made by Quintin, Vas-Cath, or other producers, against some of whom infringement actions are pending in the U.S.) now dominates the North American market for hemodialysis catheters. It has been less successful in Europe but may have a 20% to 25% share of the market there according to Dr. Shaldon. He referred to other factors which have tended to limit its use in Europe. Dr. Uldall made it clear that prior to 1981 there was a problem which various people were seeking to solve, that Dr. Mahurkar solved the problem with his device, and that this achievement has been recognized through the rapid adoption of catheters of this type. While evidence of commercial success must be viewed with caution and is often ambiguous, in the present case I find it clear and persuasive.\n\n[29]\nI therefore am satisfied that the defendants have not established that the invention embodied in patent '508 was obvious in January, 1981 when Dr. Mahurkar achieved it.\nCompliance with section 36(1) of the Patent Act\n\n[30]\nThe defendants contend that the plaintiff has not in his patent complied with this section because the patent fails to describe adequately, or at all, a number of matters pertaining to his invention. These are set out in the particulars of objection in the defendants' pleadings. Those which appear to me to have been relied upon during the trial are as follows: the meaning of \"the relative concentration of material\" with reference to the tip as referred to in claim 14 and elsewhere, and where such material is to come from; how to form the conical tip including this material; the specific materials of which the tube and tip are to be made; and how to construct such a device which will have the utility claimed for it. Other matters set out in the particulars of objection were not relied upon in argument on behalf of the defendants.\n\n[31]\nIn applying s. 36(1) it is clear that I can look at the whole of the patent to see if the requisite information can be found in either the disclosures or the claims. This is clear from the wording of s. 36(1) itself which merely requires that the applicant describe \"in the specification\" the invention and its operation or use. The specification includes both the disclosures and the claims. The jurisprudence has confirmed this approach to s. 36(1) [see footnote 7]. While I have concluded that certain of the claims are invalid, for purposes of applying s. 36(1) I could have resorted to all of the claims. That will not be necessary, however, as I have concluded that the necessary description can be found in the disclosures and the valid claims.\n\n[32]\nThe jurisprudence also confirms that in applying s. 36(1) the court should not be too technical in its approach [see footnote 8]. As Duff, C.J.C., said in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  a reasonable view of it, can be so read as to afford the inventor protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented, the court, as a rule, will endeavour to give effect to that construction.\"\nFurther, what I must ascertain is what the whole of the patent would have meant, at the date it issued, to a person skilled in the art [see footnote 10].\n\n[33]\nAs for the meaning of the phrase \"relative concentration of material\" expert witnesses for the defendants professed bewilderment as to its meaning. Mr. Strohl could not see where this material would come from. As I indicated in respect of the infringement issue, I interpret the evidence as a whole to support the view that insertion of a plug in one lumen prior to the forming of the tip, as is done by the defendants in the fabrication of their product, can create a \"concentration of material\". Mr. Strohl in his evidence described the Blake patent of 1972 as involving a dual lumen catheter in which, at the formation stage, a plastic plug is inserted in one lumen and a round wire in the other lumen. A tapered tip is then formed by a heated die which according to him \"at the same time causes the plastic plug to lose its identity and merge into the material of the catheter tube resulting in a thickening of the tip\". I am at a loss to know why this does not create what could be described as a \"relative concentration of material\", nor why a skilled workman reading the present patent in 1985 when it was issued would not understand that as one possible meaning. Mr. Martin, on examination for discovery, in describing the process used to make the defendants' catheters, said that when the plug is inserted in the second lumen and the catheter is then heated in a mold to form the conical tip, the tubing and the plug \"liquify and flow together\" to form a unitary structure. He further said that in making catheters with a glass mold, such processes \"tend to form a concentration of material and make a more rigid ... tip\". He said these techniques were known to him in 1975. Further, in respect of the modified version of their catheters which have been produced since March, 1987 where a plug is used to block off the lumen but does not extend as far as the tip, the formation of the tip creates a thickening of the wall of the catheter between the plug and the tip (some open space being first left in a former portion of the second lumen before this thickening commences). As he said, \"that thickening results from the material that is integral with the tip\". An expert witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal, Glenn L. Beall, of Gurnee, Illinois, President of Glenn Beall Engineering Incorporated which is a manufacturer inter alia of catheters, testified (transcript, pages 991-993) that he could readily achieve a concentration of material in the fabrication of such a tip by deforming some additional portion of tube material beyond the tip and displacing that to the tip area. Mr. Beall said that he understood \"relative concentration of material\" simply to mean that there would be more material in a certain area than elsewhere. I conclude that a skilled workman would have understood the term \"relative concentration of material\" to have such a meaning and further would have known possible sources of such material, such as an additional plug fused into the tube through heating or the displacement into this area of extra material from an additional portion of the tubing.\n\n[34]\nThe other major difficulty which the defendants assert with respect to this patent is that it does not make clear how the tip is to be formed: whether it is to be manufactured as a separate piece bonded onto the end of the dual lumen tube, or is to be integrally formed from the tube itself. The defendants say that the patent in this respect is ambiguous and confusing. At page 8, lines 9 to 16 of patent '508, part of the disclosures, it is stated:\n\"The tip 20 including the relative concentration of material 23 is easily molded and bonded or is integrally formed from the cylindrical tube 11 by the use of internal and external mandrels and the application of heat by any number of conventional means such as RF forming, thermal forming, or infrared forming.\"\nFurther, in the patent drawings as reproduced at the beginning of this judgment, in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 there is a horizontal line above the tip 20 at a point where the tip ceases to taper and the cylindrical tubing of uniform diameter begins. In figure 7, on the other hand, a portion of the cylindrical tubing and the tapered tip are depicted as one integral piece. Both Dr. Shaldon and Mr. Strohl testifying on behalf of the defendants said that they understood figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 to depict a separate tip bonded to the tube. Both were of the opinion that it would be dangerous to bond the tip to the tube as secure adhesion could not be assured, and it would be very harmful to a patient if a tip came loose during the use of the catheter. Dr. Uldall said that one could bond the tip \"face to face with the lumen\" but that he would \"worry about the end becoming disconnected\" and therefore he would not use such a catheter. Mr. Beall on the other hand said that it would be difficult but not impossible to bond a tip to the tube securely. Mr. Quinton, another catheter manufacturer, said that he was not prepared to agree that it would be impractical to bond the tip to the tube although for the particular manufacturing processes of his company it was preferable to use a separate tip with inserts as they do in the manufacture of the Mahurkar catheter. Mr. Beall, however, testified that reading the patent as a whole he believed it taught the use of an integrally formed tip. He said that although there might be some ambiguity in the less detailed figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 because of the horizontal line which traverses the catheter at the base of the tip, a skilled workman would know that figure 7 which is the more detailed drawing of the tip area should be determinative. I am satisfied from his evidence that figure 7 depicts an integrally formed tip. I do not believe that any of the defendants' witnesses really contradicted this although they found figure 7 inadequate because it does not clearly explain from where the \"relative concentration of material\" is to come.\n\n[35]\nCounsel for the defendants argued on the basis of this evidence that the patent teaches the use of a separate tip bonded face to face with the end of the dual lumen tubing, that such device would be dangerous for patients, and that therefore the invention described lacks utility; or that at least it is so ambiguous as to mislead a skilled workman into one possible implementation of the patent which would not serve the purpose stated in the patent. Counsel relied in this respect on the decision of my colleague Collier, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  relevant principle is to be found in the decision of the Supreme Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  used in making electrocardiograms, etc. The claims described a cream \"composed of an aqueous emulsion\" which would contain, inter alia, \"1-10% of a highly ionizable salt ...\" It was contended that the patent did not meet the requirements of s. 36(1) of the Patent Act because this general language could include salts and solutions which might be corrosive to the skin. The Supreme Court rejected this contention because the addressee of a patent is a man skilled in the art [see footnote 13].\n\"... and the knowledge such a man is expected to possess is to be taken into consideration. To such a man it must be obvious that a cream for use with skin contact electrodes is not to be made up with ingredients that are toxic or irritating or are apt to stain or discolour the skin.\"\nIn the present case, even if Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 must be interpreted as depicting the separate bonded tip which is referred to in the disclosures as a possible design, the evidence was not clear that its use would be impossible. If it would be, this is a matter a skilled workman would know and he would not pursue this option. What the patent does is to provide a design for a dual lumen catheter with conical tip. It does not provide, nor do I think it needs to provide, manufacturing instructions. It shows the configuration required and the purposes are clear. I am satisfied that a skilled workman could take this patent and produce a catheter of that configuration, using his own knowledge to avoid constructions which would be dangerous. For the reasons which I have found infringement to exist, it is apparent that the defendants are manufacturing a catheter which incorporates the substance, and for that matter the text, of the patent. I have also indicated that I think the Mahurkar catheter manufactured by Quinton incorporates this substance even though for its own reasons the Quinton Corporation employs a manufacturing technique not referred to in the patent. In this respect the situation differs from that in the Consolboard case where the invention claimed was for a device which did not work: the complaint there was not that the patent described various devices, some of which would not work. In the present case the invention claimed is not the manufacturing process but the design and function of the catheter. As quoted above, the disclosures refer to the \"use of internal and external mandrels and the application of heat by any number of conventional means\". This is not expressed, nor is it claimed, as the invention, as the evidence disclosed that workable fabrication processes are known for the production of a catheter of this design. None of the expert witnesses denied that. I am satisfied that any skilled workman with a mind willing to understand could read this patent and proceed to the fabrication of a safe catheter of this design.\n\n[36] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[37]\nThe defendants also contended that the patent does not adequately disclose the material of which the tube and tip are to be made. It is true that the only reference in the patent to this matter is at page 8 of the disclosures where it is stated:\n\"It is readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that the tip 20 as shown in FIG. 7 is easily formed from thermo-plastic material.\"\nMr. Beall indicated that this would be sufficient to direct a reader to a \"family of materials\" of which many were available and in use in the 1980's. Some would be known to be unsuitable. While the passage quoted only refers to the material in the tip, it also refers to figure 7 which clearly depicts the tip and the tube as being integrally formed. This would, it appears to me, convey to the skilled workman that in accordance with figure 7 the whole catheter should be made of the same thermo-plastic material. It appears to me that further guidance in this respect could be found on page 4 of the disclosures where it is stated at lines 3 to 10:\n\"The catheter also has a uniform diameter along its entire length from its proximal end to the conical tapered tip. The tip guidance point is located at the center of the conical tip for uniform distribution of frictional resistance and minimization of insertion trauma and kinking. The conical tapered tip comprises a relative concentration of material to impart relative rigidity so that the tip functions as an effective dilator for soft tissue and veins.\"\nThe reference to \"kinking\" clearly implies a flexible tube and the reference to a \"relative concentration of material\" in the tip \"to impart relative rigidity\" implies that otherwise the tip would be of the same flexibility as the tube. Given also the number of thermoplastic percutaneous catheters on the market in September, 1985 when this patent issued, I find it hard to believe that a skilled workman would have difficulty in understanding what kind of material is to be used both in the tip and in the tube of the catheter. The claims, of course, assert no invention with respect to the kind of material to be employed other than with respect to its two \"D\" configuration.\n\n[38]\nThe other objections pleaded with respect to s. 36(1) of the Patent Act not having been argued, and they having no apparent substance in my view, I find that the defendants have not established invalidity of the patent by reason of a failure to describe adequately the invention or any workable invention.\nClaims Broader than the Invention Described\n\n[39]\nIn their particulars of objections filed with their statement of defence, the defendants alleged that the invention disclosed in the patent in question includes the following essential features:\n\"(a) a dual lumen catheter having two semi-circular or D-shaped lumens;\n\"(b) one lumen being shorter than the other;\n\"(c) a conical tapered tip at the distal end comprising 'a relative concentration of material' to impart relative rigidity to the tip; and\n\"(d) a tip guidance point at the centre of the conical tip.\"\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the affidavits sworn by the defendants' expert witnesses characterized the invention in almost identical language. The defendants contend that none of the claims of the patent is limited to a combination comprising all of these features. Accordingly each of them claims more than is disclosed in the specifications and more than the plaintiff invented and is thus invalid. It is also alleged that for the same reason they describe products which would not have the utility contemplated in the disclosures. I have already dealt with the utility question above.\n\n[40]\nThe plaintiff did not specifically take issue with these four elements identified by the defendants as the essentials of the invention and I believe they adequately encompass the invention revealed in the disclosures. In my view claims 7, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19, do have limitations to all of these features. It appears to me for example that claim 14 adequately limits the invention claimed to one containing these features. It commences by describing \"a double lumen catheter comprising an elongated cylindrical tube including a planar axial divider bisecting said cylindrical tube into first and second lumens\". I fail to see why this does not adequately describe \"a dual lumen catheter having two semi-circular or D-shaped lumens\". If one takes an elongated cylindrical tube and puts in it a \"planar axial divider bisecting\" that tube, one surely ends up with two lumens of equal size which are D-shaped. I should think this would be adequately clear to any one except, perhaps, a patent agent. Claim 14 goes on to state that the first lumen extends from the proximal end to the distal end of the tube and the second lumen extends from the proximal end \"to a second opening in the side of cylindrical tube, said second lumen terminating at said second opening ...\" I am unable to comprehend how that fails to describe a catheter with one lumen which is shorter than the other. If the first lumen extends from one end of the catheter to the other and the second lumen extends from one end to a hole in the side of the lumen at which point it terminates, I fail to understand how the second lumen can be other than shorter than the first lumen. Claim 14 also goes on to speak of \"a relative concentration of material extending axially from the second opening to the distal end of said cylindrical tube, the distal end of said cylindrical tube having a smooth conical tapered tip\". Again, it appears to me that this adequately limits the claim to a device with the features described in item (c) as defined above by the defendants. It is true that the claim does not explain the purpose of the relative concentration of material (i.e. \"to impart relative rigidity\" to the tip as stated in the disclosures) but that is surely unnecessary to effect the limitation of the scope of the claim to that which has been invented. With respect to item (d) identified by the defendants, \"a tip guidance point at the centre of the conical tip\", it is true that claim 14 does not employ these words which are similar to those found in the disclosures. I do not think, however, that it would be very difficult for a skilled workman reading this claim to infer that that is the intention. The claim refers to the \"first lumen extending ... to a first opening at the distal end of said cylindrical tube ...\" It goes on to refer to \"the distal end of said cylindrical tube having a smooth conical tapered tip ...\" When one is dealing with devices of this size, and given the importance of having as free a flow of blood as possible from the first lumen through the tip, the most natural interpretation which would be put on this language is that the opening would be as large as the tip would permit which would mean that it would have to be essentially centered in the tip. If a skilled workman had any lingering doubts about this they would surely be dispelled if he read claim 17 which describes a device such as claimed in 14 except that the opening in the tip \"is eccentric with respect to the axis of the conical tapered tip\". In other words, as claim 17 describes a tip with a hole which is not centered, it contrasts with claim 14. Surely a reasonable skilled workman would then read claim 14 as describing a tip wherein the hole is centered. Although I have elsewhere considered claim 17 to be invalid I see no reason why it could not be read by a skilled workman in order to clarify the scope of claim 14. In any event I believe that claim 14 is adequately circumscribed in this respect.\n\n[41]\nFor similar reasons I find that claim 7, because it incorporates claim 1, involves the four essential features defined by the defendants. Claim 1 embodies features (b) and (d) and part of (c), whereas claim 7 embodies features (a) and the remainder of (c). Claims 15, 16, 18, and 19 incorporate claim 14 which I have already held to include the essential features, and none of the additional matters claimed in 15, 16, 18, and 19 are inconsistent with the four essential features.\n\n[42]\nOn the other hand I find the remainder of the claims in issue not to be sufficiently limited to the essential features of this invention as drawn from the disclosures. Claim 1 by itself lacks features (a) and the \"relative concentration of material\" referred to in feature (c). Claims 2 to 6, 8 to 10 and 13 are dependent on 1 and do not make up for its deficiencies. Claim 12 appears to be inconsistent with feature (d) and is therefore claiming something not described in the disclosures, as does, for similar reasons, claim 17.\n\n[43]\nClaim 21, the first of the third group of claims, also lacks features (a) and part of (c) (there being no reference to \"a relative concentration of material\"). None of the dependent claims 22 to 25 make up for these deficiencies.\n\n[44]\nAs noted earlier, claims 11, 20, and 26 are not in issue.\n\n[45]\nClaims 1 to 6, 8 to 10, 12, 13, 17, and 21 to 25 are therefore invalid because they claim more than is described in the disclosures.\nConclusions\n\n[46]\nI therefore find that there has been infringement of the patent and that the patent is valid except for certain claims. It was agreed at the trial that I would hear counsel with respect to the form of relief and to costs before a formal judgment is entered. In preparation for this hearing I would request counsel for the plaintiff to draft a formal judgment for consideration, and provide such draft to the court and counsel for the defendants prior to the hearing.\nAction allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/blk\nFootnotes\n1.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 1, at 10 (F.C.A.).
