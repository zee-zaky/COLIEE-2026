    "[1]\nLayden-Stevenson, J.\n: Ms. Jean claims to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection on the basis that she had been subjected to domestic violence at the hands of her former common-law spouse. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that state protection was available to Ms. Jean in St. Lucia and it rejected her claim. This is an application for judicial review of that decision.",
    "[2]\nMs. Jean contends that the RPD engaged in a selective reading of the documentary evidence and erred in concluding that strong efforts to confront domestic abuse was a sufficient basis upon which to find that adequate state protection is available. She asserts that the RPD ought to have considered whether such efforts are yielding positive results.",
    "[3]\nI have concluded that the RPD engaged in a selective reading of the documentary evidence such that its analysis regarding state protection is deficient. Consequently, the application for judicial review will be allowed.\nBackground",
    "[4]\nMs. Jean, the mother of three children from a previous relationship, began cohabiting with her common law spouse, Henry John, in October of 2000. In early 2001, Mr. John began drinking and became verbally abusive to Ms. Jean and her children. In September of 2001, after an incident of physical abuse, Ms. Jean and the children left and went to her mothers home. When a contrite Mr. John begged them to come back, they returned to the family home. One week later, the abuse resumed and Mr. John threatened Ms. Jean that he would kill her if she ever left again.",
    "[5]\nThe abuse (both physical and mental) continued and intensified. Eventually, Ms. Jean sought the assistance of the police and the crisis centre. The police told her to sort it out and the crisis centre could not assist her because it had a long waiting list. Twice, Ms. Jean attended the hospital after episodes of abuse.",
    "[6]\nWhen Ms. Jean and her children again sought refuge at her mothers home, Mr. John repeatedly came to the house threatening to kill her if she did not return home. Ms. Jean left the children with her mother and came to Canada. After her arrival here, through telephone discussions with her mother, she learned that Mr. John had persisted in attending at her mothers home and repeating his death threats against Ms. Jean. Although her mother went to the police, no action was taken.\nThe Decision",
    "[7]\nThe RPD seemingly accepted Ms. Jeans evidence as credible but determined that state protection was available. It noted that domestic violence is a problem throughout the world. However, the government in St. Lucia is making strong efforts to address the problem. It noted that St. Lucia is a democratic country. It observed that the police have received sensitivity training regarding domestic violence, the judiciary has been diligent in processing protection orders quickly, and violators have been arrested. St. Lucia has a shelter for victims of domestic violence as well as a crisis center that provides counselling and access to social services.

    "[10]\nThe RPDs determination was based on information contained in a Response to Information Request (RIR) dated April 25, 2003. The RPD relied primarily upon the positive statements of a relations officer from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Gender Relations for St. Lucia.
