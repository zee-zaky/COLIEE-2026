Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nde Montigny, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to section 18.1 of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, RSC 1985, c F-7, of a decision by the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal, Colonel T.D. Grubb (Provost Marshal), dated November 30, 2012, to revoke the applicant's military police credentials.",
    "[2]\nFor the following reasons, I am of the opinion that this application for judicial review must be allowed.\nFacts",
    "[3]\nThe applicant, Marc Babineau, was deployed to Afghanistan in August 2010 as Deputy Commander of the Canadian mission to train Afghan police officers. He assumed his duties until July 2011.",
    "[4]\nWhile he was deployed, the applicant had difficulty operating the magazines provided by the Canadian Forces. Ammunition apparently fell out of the magazine numerous times. The applicant questioned the quality of the magazines and consequently feared for his safety if there were to be a surprise attack.",
    "[5]\nThe applicant's American counterparts advised him to purchase other magazines from the American Personnel Exchange (PX) as replacements for his Canadian magazines. The applicant purchased 14 of those magazines.",
    "[6]\nAfter that purchase, the applicant's Canadian counterparts apparently warned him about using those magazines, and told him that he risked being reprimanded if he used equipment that had not been provided by the Canadian Forces.",
    "[7]\nThe applicant wanted to return the magazines to the American PX, but he had lost his receipt and was therefore unable to return them. He then chose to send them to his spouse in Canada, by mail, in a parcel that also contained a telescope. He did note on the transmittal sheet that the parcel contained 14 magazines, and told the post office worker that there were magazines in the parcel before he mailed it. The parcel was then intercepted and seized by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).",
    "[8]\nAfter sending the parcel, the applicant learned that mailing magazines of more than five rounds was prohibited. He then contacted his spouse and told her to contact a friend, an officer of the Sûreté du Québec, so the friend could destroy the magazines when they arrived in Canada. However, the parcel had already been seized by the CBSA, which simply confiscated the magazines and required a customs fee for the telescope. No charges were laid by the CBSA regarding the sending of the parcel.",
    "[9]\nFurther to that incident, the applicant was informed that the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) was going to conduct an investigation. The applicant cooperated fully with the CFNIS and provided all documents and exhibits that he had in his possession. At the end of that investigation, in April 2011, the CFNIS charged him with exporting a prohibited device (the 14 magazines) without authorization, in violation of the\nFirearms Act\n, SC 1995, c 39 or any other Act of Parliament.",
    "[10]\nThe applicant completed his mission in Afghanistan and, upon his return to Canada, resumed his duties as a Deputy Commander of the 5th Military Police Company. The applicant also asked that Court Martial proceedings be scheduled in a timely manner so that he could participate in an exercise scheduled for the fall.",
    "[11]\nThe applicant was charged with breaching section 130 of the\nNational Defence Act\nfor having illegally imported magazines prohibited in Canada in violation of paragraph 104(1)(\na\n) of the\nCriminal Code\n, and for having committed an act to the prejudice of good order and discipline under section 129 of the\nNational Defence Act\n. He pleaded guilty to the second charge and was sentenced by the Court Martial to a reprimand and a fine of $2,000. Given the applicant's guilty plea, and because the second charge was an alternate to the first charge, the military judge ordered a stay of proceedings on the first charge:\nR v Babineau\n, 2011 CM 3009.",
    "[12]\nFollowing his guilty plea, the applicant's case was submitted to the Military Police Credentials Review Board (MPCRB or Board) for an examination as to whether the applicant's actions constitute a breach of the\nMilitary Police Professional Code of Conduct\n(MPPCC or Code). The Board may make any recommendation to the Provost Marshal that is considers appropriate, depending on the circumstances of the case, and must provide written reasons:\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, section 22.04;\nMilitary Police Policies and Technical Procedures\n, c 3, sections 17, 39 and 41. The applicant provided written submissions for the review by a five-member panel (review panel). All of the members found that the applicant had breached the MPPCC. Four out of the five members recommended a 180-day suspension, whereas the fifth member recommended that the applicant's credentials be revoked. Previously, the applicant's supervisor, Major Vouligny, had recommended a 90-day suspension and a 12-month probation.",
    "[13]\nThe case was then referred to the Provost Marshal for a decision. As the military police Commanding Officer (the highest ranked military police officer), he is the ultimate authority when it comes to disciplining members of military police. It was up to him to make the final decision in the applicant's case and he was not bound by the Review Board's recommendations.",
    "[14]\nAfter examining the Review Board's reasons and recommendations, the Provost Marshal told the applicant about his intention to revoke his military police credentials in a letter dated August 28, 2012. The Provost Marshal gave the applicant the opportunity to submit any last written representations or other new relevant documents before making his final decision. After considering the applicant's additional submissions, the Provost Marshal communicated his final decision to revoke his military police credentials on November 30, 2012.",
    "[15]\nThe applicant filed this application for judicial review before this Court on December 28, 2012.\nImpugned decision",
    "[16]\nThe Provost Marshal first noted that the panel did not attach enough weight to a fundamental factor, that is, the leadership that a military police commanding officer must demonstrate.",
    "[17]\nWhile he acknowledged that the applicant's performance was sometimes noteworthy, the Provost Marshal stated that the acts committed by the applicant are not those expected of a member of the Canadian Forces, and especially not of someone who is not only a member of the military police, but an officer who must command other military police officers responsible for enforcing the law in the Canadian Forces. He added the following: [translation] \"I have lost the full confidence that I had in Captain Babineau's ability to carry out his duties as a military police officer, and I believe that his credibility with his subordinates is non-existent\": Respondent's Record, page 508.",
    "[18]\nThe Provost Marshal also noted that Captain Babineau admitted to not knowing that the importation of large capacity magazines was contrary to the\nCriminal Code\nand to theatre standing orders and pleaded guilty at Court Martial even though he has more than 20 years of experience in the Canadian Forces, is a former member of combat arms, a competent investigator with the military police and someone who regularly carries a firearm. In the eyes of the Provost Marshal, breaches to the MPPCC cannot be taken lightly, and it is impossible to justify letting a military police officer keep his credentials when he acted in a manner that would lead to the disqualification of a candidate who was in a similar situation during his or her participation at the Military Police Assessment Centre. In that regard, the Provost Marshal found the following: [translation] \"In my opinion, Captain Babineau was deceitful in those circumstances and that is reflective of an aspect of his character. I cannot resolve the breach with a suspension\": Respondent's Record, page 509.",
    "[19]\nThe last substantive paragraph of the Provost Marshal's notice of intent warrants being reproduced in its entirety for a proper understanding of the substance of his decision:\n[translation]\nAs part of my deliberations in this case, I have raised major concerns regarding the severity of Captain Babineau's conduct. Even though the MPCRB is mandated to examine MPPCC-related issues, it is my duty as Canadian Forces Provost Marshal to consider all of the factors that reflect the abilities of those appointed within the military police force, including a person's leadership. Captain Babineau, by his own admission, is guilty of actions that are directly related to his honesty and integrity. His discredit within the military police force was exacerbated by the publication of his actions in the national media and by his subsequent conviction. Furthermore, I note that Captain Babineau did not acknowledge the severity of that contravention in his guilty plea. To the contrary, he made considerable efforts to justify his actions; he tried to minimize the severity of the offence and challenged the investigation process and the investigator. Rather than admitting his contravention, showing remorse for his actions and apologizing for having been discredited and harming the reputation of his commission and the military police, he claimed that the matter was a minor error and accused others of submitting the case to the MPCRB. The MPCRB determined that Captain Babineau's actions were clearly disreputable and contrary to public interest, and that they could only harm the reputation of the military police. That directly contributed to my decision.\nIssue",
    "[20]\nThe only issue on this application for judicial review is whether the Provost Marshal's decision to revoke the applicant's military police credentials was reasonable.\nAnalysis",
    "[21]\nEven though this Court has never ruled on the standard of review applicable to decisions by the Provost Marshal when the MPPCC is applied, there seems to me to be no doubt that the appropriate standard is reasonableness. First, the applicant does not challenge the fact that he breached subsection 4(l) of the MPPCC; his issue is with the severity of the sanction that was imposed on him by the Provost Marshal. It was a discretionary decision that was based essentially on an assessment of the facts. Furthermore, the Provost Marshal clearly knows the military context and has more expertise than this Court in that area.",
    "[22]\nSecond, the Court has already determined that the standard of review applicable to decisions by the Chief of the Defence Staff in grievance matters is reasonableness. For example, Justice Near (while a member of this Court) stated the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). I come to this conclusion after considering the following: the fact that decisions of the CDS are final and binding, except for judicial review under the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7; that the CDS is charged with control and administration of the Canadian Forces and is interpreting its own statute; that the statutory scheme provided the CDS with discretionary power in his determination of such grievances, and that the issues to be addressed are predominantly those of fact or mixed fact and law.\nSee also:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIn my view, the same factors apply when the Provost Marshal makes a decision stemming from the MPPCC. As a result, deference should apply to the Provost Marshal's decision. To the extent that his decision falls within the range of \"possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\", and is the result of an intelligible and transparent process and has justification, this Court will not intervene. Such attitude does not involve, however, an abdication of the responsibilities assigned to the judiciary in its examination of administrative decisions. As the Supreme Court took pains to point out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (at paragraph 48), \"[i]t does not mean that courts are subservient to the determinations of decision makers, or that courts must show blind reverence to their interpretations\", or that they may be content to pay lip service to the concept of reasonableness review while in fact imposing their own view. It is therefore in that perspective that the Provost Marshal's decision must be examined.",
    "[23]\nThe respondent is correct in maintaining that the Provost Marshal was in no way bound by the Review Board's findings or recommendations, but was simply required to consider them:\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, c 22, paragraph 22.04(11);\nMilitary Police Policies and Technical Procedures\n, c 3, sections 17 and 41. However, the Provost Marshal's decision to depart from an almost unanimous recommendation (4 out of 5 members) by the Review Board must be based on solid justification and rely on the evidence in the record. It is in this respect that the Provost Marshal's decision is deficient.",
    "[24]\nThe Provost Marshal first criticizes the applicant for not expressing remorse or recognizing the severity of the offence that he committed. Two comments are required in that respect. First, the severity of the act committed by Captain Babineau must be qualified. First, the fact that he mailed a parcel to Canada that contained magazines, which are devices prohibited by law, was a military offence under section 129 of the\nNational Defence Act\nand not a criminal offence, like the Provost Marshal stated. It is true that a military police officer is expected to have better knowledge of the law than a regular member of the Canadian Forces military and demonstrate, at the very least, more prudence. That being said, the offence committed seems, by in large, quite technical, given the fact that sending magazines of less than five rounds does not constitute an offence. Moreover, the fact that the applicant acted in good faith is not challenged because he never concealed the nature of the shipped merchandise; to the contrary, he explicitly described what was inside the parcel and seems to have packed it in full view of the postmaster, who the respondent did not deem necessary to call as a witness. Captain Babineau's statement that he asked a friend who is a member of the Sûreté du Québec to destroy the magazines once he learned of their illegal nature was also not challenged. Given all of the facts, there is no doubt that the applicant was negligent, but nothing indicates that he acted in bad faith.",
    "[25]\nRegarding his supposed lack of remorse, the evidence in the record tends to demonstrate to the contrary. First, the Court Martial judge considered the fact that Captain Babineau pleaded guilty to the offence that he was accused of as a mitigating factor, and added that he \"showed very clearly that [he is] remorseful and sincerely intend[s] to remain a solid asset within the Canadian Forces\" (Respondent's Record, page 260). Second, the Review Board also disclosed as a mitigating factor that Captain Babineau acknowledged his errors and pleaded guilty at Court Martial. He even took the initiative to take a specialized course on prohibited weapons after the incident with which he was charged, which is some evidence that he recognized his deficiencies and wanted to address them.",
    "[26]\nIt is true that in the observations that he submitted to the Review Board, the applicant argued that the equipment put at the disposal of the Canadian military was not always adequate and he tried to explain why he had sent the magazines by mail. Those statements do not seem to me to reflect a lack of remorse or a willingness to avoid responsibility; to the contrary, they are clearly part of an approach to explain the context in which the offence was committed in a manner to convince the Review Board that he does not deserve an unduly harsh punishment.",
    "[27]\nThe Provost Marshal also seems to challenge the applicant's credibility with his subordinates. However, the evidence demonstrates that he received Personnel Evaluation Reports (PERs) according to which his performance was considered [translation] \"satisfactory\", [translation] \"above average\" or [translation] \"mastered\", even after the offence with which he was charged. Those reports clearly establish that his superiors still had confidence in him. Furthermore, he was kept in his position as Deputy Commander of the Canadian mission to train Afghan police officers despite the charges against him, and resumed his duties as Deputy Commander of the 5th Military Police Company upon his return to Canada.",
    "[28]\nIn its decision, the Court Martial stated the principle that \"any sentence imposed by a court, be it civilian or military, must be adapted to the individual offender and constitute the minimum necessary intervention, since moderation is the bedrock principle of the modern theory of sentencing in Canada\". In this case, I am of the opinion that the sanction imposed by the Provost Marshal is not proportional to the severity of the offence with which the applicant was charged. Four out of five members of the Review Board found that a 180-day suspension, the longest possible suspension under subsection 22.04(11) of the\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, would be appropriate. His immediate superior, Major Stéphane Vouligny, recommended a 90-day suspension and 12-month probation period. The Provost Marshal, by raising considerations that are not supported by the evidence in the record, chose to not accept those recommendations and to impose the most severe sentence, that is, the revocation of his military police credentials. Not only is that sanction not proportional to the severity of the offence, but it is undeniably unreasonable in the circumstances.",
    "[29]\nIt also appears from section 39 regarding the MPPCC that the Review Board can only proceed with a revocation \"only after all other possible recommendations have been considered, and when no other alternative approach may be envisaged\". That same provision also states that the Review Board must make its recommendations based on all relevant factors such as the severity of the violation of the Code, the member's offence history and the existence of mitigating circumstances. Even though that provision applies formally only to the Review Board, it is difficult to understand how the Provost Marshal could ignore it, unless there were perhaps very exceptional circumstances, which is not the case here. At risk of acting arbitrarily, the Provost Marshal's discretion cannot be absolute. If he wanted to depart from the Review Board's recommendations, he was required to provide a convincing explanation for doing so, which he unfortunately failed to do. To the contrary, he relied on grounds that are not supported by the evidence, he did not consider the applicant's clear record and performance evaluations and he overlooked the mitigating circumstances that the Court Martial and the Review Board nonetheless accepted. Under these circumstances, his decision must be set aside to allow him to redetermine the matter on the basis of these reasons.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[30]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, with costs to the applicant, and that the Provost Marshal's decision dated November 30, 2012, is set aside. As a result, the matter it sent back to him for redetermination on the basis of these reasons.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  judiciaire en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la\nLoi sur les Cours fédérales\n, LRC 1985, c F-7, de la décision du Grand Prévôt des Forces canadiennes, le Colonel T.D.

    "[31]\nTHE COURT RULES that the application for judicial review is granted, with costs in favor of the applicant, and that the decision of the Grand Provost rendered on November 30, 2012 is set aside.

Given all of the facts, there is no doubt that the applicant was negligent, but nothing indicates that he acted in bad faith.\n[25]\nRegarding his supposed lack of remorse, the evidence in the record tends to demonstrate to the contrary. First, the Court Martial judge considered the fact that Captain Babineau pleaded guilty to the offence that he was accused of as a mitigating factor, and added that he \"showed very clearly that [he is] remorseful and sincerely intend[s] to remain a solid asset within the Canadian Forces\" (Respondent's Record, page 260). Second, the Review Board also disclosed as a mitigating factor that Captain Babineau acknowledged his errors and pleaded guilty at Court Martial. He even took the initiative to take a specialized course on prohibited weapons after the incident with which he was charged, which is some evidence that he recognized his deficiencies and wanted to address them.\n[26]\nIt is true that in the observations that he submitted to the Review Board, the applicant argued that the equipment put at the disposal of the Canadian military was not always adequate and he tried to explain why he had sent the magazines by mail. Those statements do not seem to me to reflect a lack of remorse or a willingness to avoid responsibility; to the contrary, they are clearly part of an approach to explain the context in which the offence was committed in a manner to convince the Review Board that he does not deserve an unduly harsh punishment.\n[27]\nThe Provost Marshal also seems to challenge the applicant's credibility with his subordinates. However, the evidence demonstrates that he received Personnel Evaluation Reports (PERs) according to which his performance was considered [translation] \"satisfactory\", [translation] \"above average\" or [translation] \"mastered\", even after the offence with which he was charged. Those reports clearly establish that his superiors still had confidence in him. Furthermore, he was kept in his position as Deputy Commander of the Canadian mission to train Afghan police officers despite the charges against him, and resumed his duties as Deputy Commander of the 5th Military Police Company upon his return to Canada.\n[28]\nIn its decision, the Court Martial stated the principle that \"any sentence imposed by a court, be it civilian or military, must be adapted to the individual offender and constitute the minimum necessary intervention, since moderation is the bedrock principle of the modern theory of sentencing in Canada\". In this case, I am of the opinion that the sanction imposed by the Provost Marshal is not proportional to the severity of the offence with which the applicant was charged. Four out of five members of the Review Board found that a 180-day suspension, the longest possible suspension under subsection 22.04(11) of the\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, would be appropriate. His immediate superior, Major Stéphane Vouligny, recommended a 90-day suspension and 12-month probation period. The Provost Marshal, by raising considerations that are not supported by the evidence in the record, chose to not accept those recommendations and to impose the most severe sentence, that is, the revocation of his military police credentials. Not only is that sanction not proportional to the severity of the offence, but it is undeniably unreasonable in the circumstances.\n[29]\nIt also appears from section 39 regarding the MPPCC that the Review Board can only proceed with a revocation \"only after all other possible recommendations have been considered, and when no other alternative approach may be envisaged\". That same provision also states that the Review Board must make its recommendations based on all relevant factors such as the severity of the violation of the Code, the member's offence history and the existence of mitigating circumstances. Even though that provision applies formally only to the Review Board, it is difficult to understand how the Provost Marshal could ignore it, unless there were perhaps very exceptional circumstances, which is not the case here. At risk of acting arbitrarily, the Provost Marshal's discretion cannot be absolute. If he wanted to depart from the Review Board's recommendations, he was required to provide a convincing explanation for doing so, which he unfortunately failed to do. To the contrary, he relied on grounds that are not supported by the evidence, he did not consider the applicant's clear record and performance evaluations and he overlooked the mitigating circumstances that the Court Martial and the Review Board nonetheless accepted. Under these circumstances, his decision must be set aside to allow him to redetermine the matter on the basis of these reasons.\nJUDGMENT\n[30]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, with costs to the applicant, and that the Provost Marshal's decision dated November 30, 2012, is set aside. As a result, the matter it sent back to him for redetermination on the basis of these reasons.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  judiciaire en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la\nLoi sur les Cours fédérales\n, LRC 1985, c F-7, de la décision du Grand Prévôt des Forces canadiennes, le Colonel T.D. Grubb (le  Grand Prévôt ), datée du 30 novembre 2012, révoquant les attestations de policier militaire du demandeur.\n[2]\nPour les motifs qui suivent, je suis d'avis que cette demande de contrôle judiciaire doit être accueillie.\nFaits\n[3]\nLe demandeur, Marc Babineau, a été déployé en Afghanistan au mois d'août 2010 comme Commandant Adjoint de la mission canadienne d'entraînement de la police afghane. Il a occupé ses fonctions jusqu'en juillet 2011.\n[4]\nAu cours de son déploiement, le demandeur a eu des difficultés avec le fonctionnement des chargeurs fournis par les Forces canadiennes. Des munitions sont apparemment tombées du chargeur à plusieurs reprises. Le demandeur doutait de la qualité des chargeurs et en conséquence craignait pour sa sécurité en cas d'attaque surprise.\n[5]\nLes confrères américains du demandeur lui ont conseillé d'acheter d'autres chargeurs du Personnel Exchange [PEx ou PX] américain afin de remplacer ses chargeurs canadiens. Le demandeur s'est procuré 14 de ces chargeurs.\n[6]\nSuite à cet achat, des confrères canadiens du demandeur l'auraient mis en garde contre l'utilisation de ces chargeurs, lui disant qu'il courait le risque d'être réprimandé s'il utilisait un équipement qui n'était pas fourni par les Forces canadiennes.\n[7]\nLe demandeur a voulu retourner les chargeurs au PX américain, mais il avait perdu sa facture et n'a donc pas pu les retourner. Il a alors choisi de les envoyer à sa conjointe au Canada, par la poste, dans un colis contenant également une lunette optique. Il a bien noté sur le bordereau d'envoi qu'il s'agissait de 14 chargeurs (  14 magazines ), et il avait indiqué à l'agent du bureau de poste qu'il s'agissait de chargeurs avant de poster le colis. Le colis a par la suite été intercepté et retenu par l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada [ASFC].\n[8]\nAprès avoir envoyé le colis, le demandeur a appris qu'il était interdit de poster des chargeurs contenant plus de cinq (5) munitions. Il est alors entré en contact avec sa conjointe pour qu'elle communique avec un ami, un agent de la Sûreté du Québec, pour qu'il détruise les chargeurs à leur arrivée au Canada. Cependant, le colis avait déjà été saisi par l'ASFC qui a simplement confisqué les chargeurs et requis le paiement de frais de douanes pour la lunette optique. Aucune accusation n'a été portée par l'ASFC relativement à l'envoi du colis.\n[9]\nSuite à cet incident, le demandeur a été avisé que le Service national des enquêtes des Forces canadiennes [SNEFC] allait procéder à une enquête. Le demandeur a entièrement collaboré avec le SNEFC, et a fourni tous les documents et pièces qu'il avait en sa possession. Au terme de cette enquête, en avril 2011, il a été mis en accusation par le SNEFC pour avoir exporté un dispositif prohibé (les 14 chargeurs) sans autorisation, en contravention de la\nLoi sur les armes à feu\n, LC 1995, ch 39 ou de toute autre loi fédérale.\n[10]\nLe demandeur a complété sa mission en Afghanistan et, à son retour au Canada, a repris ses fonctions comme Commandant Adjoint de la 5e compagnie de la Police militaire. Le demandeur a aussi demandé que les procédures à la Cour martiale soient fixées rapidement afin qu'il puisse participer à un exercice prévu pour l'automne.\n[11]\nLe demandeur a été accusé d'avoir enfreint l'article 130 de la\nLoi sur la défense nationale\npour avoir illégalement importé des chargeurs prohibés au Canada en contravention de l'alinéa 104(1)(\na\n) du\nCode criminel\n, et d'avoir commis un acte préjudiciable au bon ordre et à la discipline selon l'article 129 de la\nLoi sur la défense nationale\n. Il a plaidé coupable au deuxième chef d'accusation et a été condamné par la Cour martiale à une réprimande et à une amende de 2 000$. Compte tenu de l'aveu de culpabilité du demandeur, et comme le deuxième chef d'accusation était subsidiaire au premier chef d'accusation, le Juge militaire a suspendu l'instance à l'égard du premier chef:\nR c Babineau\n, 2011 CM 3009.\n[12]\nSuite à son plaidoyer de culpabilité, le dossier du demandeur a été soumis au Conseil de révision des attestations de la Police militaire [CRAPM ou Conseil] pour examiner si les actes du demandeur constituent une violation du\nCode de déontologie de la Police militaire\n[CDPM ou Code]. Le Conseil peut soumettre au Grand Prévôt toute recommandation qu'il juge appropriée, selon les circonstances de l'affaire, et doit fournir des motifs écrits:\nOrdonnances et règlements royaux applicables aux Forces\ncanadiennes, art. 22.04;\nConsignes et procédures techniques de la Police militaire\n, ch 3, arts. 17, 39 et 41. Le demandeur a fourni des représentations écrites pour la révision par un comité de cinq membres ( comité de révision ). Tous les membres ont conclu que le demandeur avait violé le CDPM. Quatre des cinq membres ont recommandé une suspension de 180 jours, tandis que le cinquième a plutôt préconisé la révocation des attestations du demandeur. Auparavant, le superviseur du demandeur, le major Vouligny, avait recommandé une suspension de 90 jours ainsi qu'une mise en garde de 12 mois.\n[13]\nLe dossier a par la suite été référé au Grand Prévôt pour décision. À titre de Commandant de la Police militaire (l'officier détenant le grade le plus élevé au sein de la Police militaire), il est l'autorité ultime en ce qui a trait à la discipline des membres de la Police militaire. Il lui revenait de prendre la décision finale dans le cas du demandeur et n'était pas lié par les recommandations du Conseil de révision.\n[14]\nAprès examen des motifs et des recommandations du Conseil de révision, le Grand Prévôt a fait part au demandeur de son intention de révoquer ses attestations de policier militaire dans une lettre en date du 28 août 2012. Le Grand Prévôt a donné l'opportunité au demandeur de fournir une dernière représentation écrite et tout autre nouveau document pertinent avant de rendre sa décision finale. Après avoir considéré les représentations supplémentaires du demandeur, le Grand Prévôt lui a communiqué sa décision finale de révoquer ses attestations de policier militaire le 30 novembre 2012.\n[15]\nLe demandeur a déposé la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire devant cette Cour le 28 décembre 2012.\nLa décision contestée\n[16]\nLe Grand Prévôt note tout d'abord que le Comité n'a pas accordé assez de poids à un facteur fondamental, soit le leadership que doit démontrer un officier commandant la police militaire.\n[17]\nTout en reconnaissant que le rendement du demandeur était parfois digne de mention, le Grand Prévôt a indiqué que les actes commis par le demandeur ne sont pas ceux qui sont attendus d'un militaire des Forces canadiennes, et surtout d'une personne qui est non seulement un membre de la Police militaire mais un officier qui doit commander les autres policiers militaires chargés d'appliquer la loi dans les Forces canadiennes. Il ajoute:  J'ai perdu l'entière confiance que j'avais en la capacité du Capt Babineau de remplir ses fonctions à titre d'officier de la Police militaire, et je crois que sa crédibilité auprès de ses subordonnés est inexistante : Dossier du défendeur, p 508.\n[18]\nLe Grand Prévôt note également que le Capitaine Babineau a admis ignorer que l'importation de chargeurs à grand capacité était contraire au\nCode criminel\net aux ordres permanents du théâtre et avoir plaidé coupable en Cour martiale, alors même qu'il compte plus de 20 ans d'expérience dans les Forces canadiennes, qu'il est un ancien membre des armes de combat, un enquêteur compétent de la Police militaire et une personne qui porte régulièrement une arme à feu. Aux yeux du Grand Prévôt, les violations au CDPM ne peuvent être prises à la légère, et l'on ne saurait permettre qu'un officier de la Police militaire conserve ses attestations s'il pose des gestes qui entraîneraient le rejet d'une candidature si une personne se retrouvait dans une situation semblable pendant sa participation au Centre d'évaluation de la Police militaire. À cet égard, le Grand Prévôt conclut:  Selon moi, le Capt Babineau a été trompeur dans ces circonstances et cela reflète un aspect de son caractère. Je ne peux régler cette violation par une suspension : Dossier du défendeur, p 509.\n[19]\nLe dernier paragraphe substantif de l'avis d'intention du Grand Prévôt mérite d'être reproduit intégralement pour bien comprendre la teneur de sa décision:\nDans le cadre de mes délibérations dans ce dossier, j'ai soulevé des préoccupations importantes au sujet de la gravité de la conduite du Capt Babineau. Bien que le CRAPM soit mandaté pour examiner les questions concernant le CDPM, il est de mon devoir en tant que Grand Prévôt des Forces canadiennes de prendre en considération tous les facteurs reflétant les aptitudes d'une personne nommée au sein de la Police militaire, y compris le niveau de leadership d'une personne. Le Capt Babineau, de son propre aveu, est coupable d'actions qui sont directement liées à son honnêteté et à son intégrité. Sa discréditation au sein de la Police militaire a été aggravée par la publication de ses actions dans les médias nationaux et par sa déclaration de culpabilité subséquente. De plus, je constate que le Capt Babineau ne reconnaît aucunement la gravité de cette transgression dans sa déclaration. Au contraire, il déploie des efforts considérables afin de justifier ses actions; il tente de minimiser la gravité de l'infraction et il remet en question le processus d'enquête et l'enquêteur. Plutôt que d'avouer sa transgression, de démontrer du remord pour ses actions et d'offrir des excuses pour s'être discrédité et avoir nuit à la réputation de sa commission et de la Police militaire, il prétend que cette affaire était une erreur mineure et il accuse d'autres personnes d'avoir présenté ce dossier au CRAPM. Le CRAPM a déterminé que les actions du Capt Babineau étaient clairement de mauvaise réputation et contraires à l'intérêt public, et qu'elles ne pouvaient que nuire à la réputation de la Police militaire. Cela a contribué directement à ma décision.\nQuestion en litige\n[20]\nLa seule question en litige dans le cadre de la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire consiste à déterminer si la décision du Grand Prévôt de révoquer les attestations de policier militaire du demandeur était raisonnable.\nAnalyse\n[21]\nBien que cette Cour ne se soit jamais prononcée sur la norme de contrôle applicable aux décisions prises par le Grand Prévôt lorsqu'il applique le CDPM, il ne me semble pas faire de doute que la norme appropriée soit celle de la décision raisonnable. D'une part, le demandeur ne conteste pas le fait qu'il a enfreint le paragraphe 4(l) du CDPM; ce qu'il remet en question, c'est la sévérité de la sanction qui lui a été imposée par le Grand Prévôt. Or, il s'agit là d'une décision de nature discrétionnaire et reposant essentiellement sur l'appréciation des faits. De plus, le Grand Prévôt connaît manifestement le contexte militaire et jouit d'une plus grande expertise que cette Cour en la matière.\n[22]\nD'autre part, la Cour a déjà statué que la norme de contrôle applicable aux décisions du Chef d'état-major de la Défense en matière de règlement de griefs était celle de la décision raisonnable. À titre d'illustration, le juge Near (alors qu'il était membre de cette Cour) écrivait dans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). J'en arrive à cette conclusion après avoir tenu compte de ce qui suit: le fait que les décisions du CEMD sont définitives et obligatoires, sous réserve du contrôle judiciaire prévu par la\nLoi sur les Cours fédérales\n, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-7, le fait que le CEMD est chargé du contrôle et de l'administration des Forces canadiennes et qu'il interprète sa propre loi, le fait que le régime législatif accorde au CEMD un pouvoir discrétionnaire en ce qui concerne le règlement de ces griefs et, enfin, le fait que les questions à aborder sont d'abord et avant tout des questions de fait ou des questions mixtes de droit et de fait.\nVoir aussi:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 25-27;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[23]\nÀ mon avis, les mêmes facteurs trouvent application lorsque le Grand Prévôt prend une décision découlant du CDPM. Par conséquent, la décision du Grand Prévôt doit faire l'objet de déférence. Dans la mesure où sa décision fait partie des  issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit , résulte d'un processus intelligible et transparent et repose sur une justification, cette Cour n'interviendra pas. Une telle attitude n'implique cependant pas une abdication des responsabilités qui sont dévolues au pouvoir judiciaire dans son examen des décisions administratives. Comme la Cour suprême se faisait fort de le rappeler dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (au para 48),  [I]l ne s'ensuit pas que les cours de justice doivent s'incliner devant les conclusions des décideurs ni qu'elles doivent respecter aveuglément leurs interprétations\", pas plus qu'elles ne peuvent invoquer la notion de raisonnabilité pour imposer leurs propres vues. C'est donc dans cette perspective que la décision du Grand Prévôt doit être examinée.\n[24]\nLe défendeur a raison de soutenir que le Grand Prévôt n'était nullement lié par les conclusions ni les recommandations du Conseil de révision, mais devait tout simplement en tenir compte:\nOrdonnances et règlements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes\n, Ch 22, para 22.04(11);\nConsignes et procédures techniques de la Police militaire\n, Ch 3, arts. 17 et 41. En revanche, la décision du Grand Prévôt d'écarter une recommandation quasi unanime (4 membres sur 5) du Conseil de révision doit reposer sur de solides justifications et s'appuyer sur la preuve au dossier. Or, c'est à ce chapitre que la décision du Grand Prévôt est déficiente.\n[25]\nLe Grand Prévôt reproche tout d'abord au demandeur de ne pas avoir exprimé de remord et de ne pas avoir reconnu la gravité de l'infraction qu'il a commise. Deux commentaires s'imposent à cet égard. Tout d'abord, la gravité du geste posé par le Capitaine Babineau doit être nuancée. D'une part, le fait d'avoir expédié des chargeurs au Canada par la poste, lesquels sont des dispositifs prohibés par la loi, constituait une infraction d'ordre militaire aux termes de l'article 129 de la\nLoi sur la défense nationale\net non une infraction criminelle, comme l'écrit le Grand Prévôt. Il est vrai que l'on est en droit de s'attendre à ce qu'un policier militaire ait une meilleure connaissance de la loi qu'un simple militaire des Forces armées et fasse preuve, à tout le moins, d'une plus grande prudence. Ceci étant dit, l'infraction commise apparaît somme toute assez technique, compte tenu du fait que l'envoi de chargeurs de moins de cinq balles ne constitue pas une infraction. Qui plus est, il n'est pas contesté que le demandeur était de bonne foi, n'ayant jamais dissimulé la nature des marchandises expédiées; au contraire, il a explicitement décrit ce qui se trouvait à l'intérieur du colis et semble même l'avoir emballé au vu et au su du maître de poste, que le défendeur n'a pas jugé bon de faire témoigner. On n'a pas non plus remis en question l'affirmation du Capitaine Babineau selon laquelle il avait demandé à un ami membre de la Sûreté du Québec de détruire les chargeurs dès qu'il a appris leur caractère illégal. Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces faits, il ne fait aucun doute que le demandeur a fait preuve de négligence, mais rien n'indique qu'il était de mauvaise foi.\n[26]\nQuant à son prétendu manque de remords, la preuve au dossier tend à démontrer le contraire. Tout d'abord, le juge de la Cour martiale tient compte du fait que le Capitaine Babineau a plaidé coupable à l'infraction dont il était accusé au nombre des facteurs atténuants, et ajoute qu'il a  témoigné de manière très manifeste de [ses] remords, de [sa] sincérité dans [son] intention de continuer à représenter un actif solide au sein des Forces canadiennes  (Dossier du défendeur, p 260). D'autre part, le Conseil de révision a également relevé comme facteur atténuant que le Capitaine Babineau a reconnu ses erreurs et a plaidé coupable en Cour martiale. Il a même pris l'initiative de suivre un cours de spécialisation sur les armes prohibées après l'évènement qu'on lui reproche, ce qui témoigne dans une certaine mesure du fait qu'il reconnaît ses lacunes et veut les combler.\n[27]\nIl est vrai que dans les observations qu'il a présentées au Conseil de révision, le demandeur a fait valoir que l'équipement mis à la disposition des militaires canadiens n'était pas toujours adéquat et a tenté d'expliquer pourquoi il avait expédié les chargeurs par la poste. Ces déclarations ne me semblent pas refléter une absence de remords ou une volonté de nier sa responsabilité; au contraire, elles s'inscrivent parfaitement dans une démarche visant à expliquer le contexte dans lequel l'infraction a été commise de façon à convaincre le Conseil de révision qu'il ne mérite pas une peine trop lourde.\n[28]\nLe Grand Prévôt semble aussi remettre en question la crédibilité du demandeur auprès de ses subordonnés. Or, la preuve démontre qu'il avait reçu des rapports d'appréciation du personnel [RAP] selon lesquels son rendement est considéré  satisfaisant ,  au-dessus de la norme  ou  maîtrisé , et ce même après l'infraction qu'on lui a reprochée. Ces rapports établissent clairement que ses supérieurs avaient toujours confiance en lui. D'ailleurs, il a été maintenu dans ses fonctions comme Commandant adjoint de la mission canadienne d'entraînement de la police afghane malgré les accusations portées contre lui, et a repris ses fonctions comme Commandant adjoint de la 5e compagnie de la Police militaire à son retour au Canada.\n[29]\nDans sa décision, la Cour martiale a énoncé le principe selon lequel  toute peine infligée par un tribunal qu'il soit civil ou militaire doit être individualisée et représenter l'intervention minimale requise puisque la modération est le principe fondamental de la théorie moderne de la détermination de la peine au Canada . En l'occurrence, je suis d'avis que la sanction imposée par le Grand Prévôt n'est pas proportionnelle à la gravité de l'infraction reprochée au demandeur. Quatre des cinq membres du Conseil de révision avaient conclu qu'une suspension de 180 jours, la plus longue pouvant être ordonnée sous l'autorité du paragraphe 22.04(11) des\nOrdonnances et règlements royaux applicables aux Forces canadiennes\n, serait appropriée. Son supérieur immédiat, le Major Stéphane Vouligny, recommandait pour sa part une suspension de 90 jours et une probation de 12 mois. Le Grand Prévôt, invoquant des considérations qui ne trouvent pas appui dans la preuve au dossier, a choisi de ne pas retenir ces recommandations et d'imposer la peine la plus sévère qui soit, à savoir la révocation de ses titres de créance de police militaire. Non seulement cette sanction n'est-elle pas proportionnelle à la gravité de l'infraction, mais elle est indéniablement déraisonnable compte tenu de l'ensemble des circonstances.\n[30]\nIl appert également de l'article 39 du CDPM que le Conseil de révision ne peut envisager la révocation  qu'après avoir pris en considération toutes les autres recommandations possibles et seulement en dernier recours . Cette même disposition prévoit par ailleurs que le Conseil de révision doit formuler ses recommandations en tenant compte de tous les facteurs pertinents comme la gravité de la violation du Code, les antécédents d'infraction du membre visé et l'existence de circonstances atténuantes. Bien que cette disposition ne s'applique formellement qu'au Conseil de révision, on voit mal comment le Grand Prévôt pourrait y passer outre sauf peut-être dans des circonstances très exceptionnelles que l'on ne retrouve pas dans le présent dossier. Au risque de sombrer dans l'arbitraire, la discrétion du Grand Prévôt ne peut être absolue. S'il désirait s'écarter des recommandations formulées par le Conseil de révision, il avait l'obligation de s'en expliquer de façon convaincante, ce qu'il n'a malheureusement pas réussi à faire. Au contraire, il s'est appuyé sur des motifs que la preuve n'étaye pas, il n'a pas tenu compte du dossier sans taches du demandeur et de ses évaluations de rendement, et a passé sous silence les circonstances atténuantes qu'avaient pourtant retenues la Cour martiale et le Conseil de révision. Dans ces circonstances, sa décision doit être annulée pour lui permettre de revoir le dossier à la lumière des présents motifs.\nJUGEMENT\n[31]\nLA COUR STATUE que la demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, avec dépens en faveur du demandeur, et que la décision du Grand Prévôt rendue le 30 novembre 2012 est annulée. En conséquence, le dossier lui est retourné pour qu'une nouvelle décision soit prise en conformité avec les présents motifs.\n[End of document]",

Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nde Montigny, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to section 18.1 of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, RSC 1985, c F-7, of a decision by the Canadian Forces Provost Marshal, Colonel T.D. Grubb (Provost Marshal), dated November 30, 2012, to revoke the applicant's military police credentials.\n\n[2]\nFor the following reasons, I am of the opinion that this application for judicial review must be allowed.\nFacts\n\n[3]\nThe applicant, Marc Babineau, was deployed to Afghanistan in August 2010 as Deputy Commander of the Canadian mission to train Afghan police officers. He assumed his duties until July 2011.\n\n[4]\nWhile he was deployed, the applicant had difficulty operating the magazines provided by the Canadian Forces. Ammunition apparently fell out of the magazine numerous times. The applicant questioned the quality of the magazines and consequently feared for his safety if there were to be a surprise attack.\n\n[5]\nThe applicant's American counterparts advised him to purchase other magazines from the American Personnel Exchange (PX) as replacements for his Canadian magazines. The applicant purchased 14 of those magazines.\n\n[6]\nAfter that purchase, the applicant's Canadian counterparts apparently warned him about using those magazines, and told him that he risked being reprimanded if he used equipment that had not been provided by the Canadian Forces.\n\n[7]\nThe applicant wanted to return the magazines to the American PX, but he had lost his receipt and was therefore unable to return them. He then chose to send them to his spouse in Canada, by mail, in a parcel that also contained a telescope. He did note on the transmittal sheet that the parcel contained 14 magazines, and told the post office worker that there were magazines in the parcel before he mailed it. The parcel was then intercepted and seized by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n\n[8]\nAfter sending the parcel, the applicant learned that mailing magazines of more than five rounds was prohibited. He then contacted his spouse and told her to contact a friend, an officer of the Sûreté du Québec, so the friend could destroy the magazines when they arrived in Canada. However, the parcel had already been seized by the CBSA, which simply confiscated the magazines and required a customs fee for the telescope. No charges were laid by the CBSA regarding the sending of the parcel.\n\n[9]\nFurther to that incident, the applicant was informed that the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) was going to conduct an investigation. The applicant cooperated fully with the CFNIS and provided all documents and exhibits that he had in his possession. At the end of that investigation, in April 2011, the CFNIS charged him with exporting a prohibited device (the 14 magazines) without authorization, in violation of the\nFirearms Act\n, SC 1995, c 39 or any other Act of Parliament.\n\n[10]\nThe applicant completed his mission in Afghanistan and, upon his return to Canada, resumed his duties as a Deputy Commander of the 5th Military Police Company. The applicant also asked that Court Martial proceedings be scheduled in a timely manner so that he could participate in an exercise scheduled for the fall.\n\n[11]\nThe applicant was charged with breaching section 130 of the\nNational Defence Act\nfor having illegally imported magazines prohibited in Canada in violation of paragraph 104(1)(\na\n) of the\nCriminal Code\n, and for having committed an act to the prejudice of good order and discipline under section 129 of the\nNational Defence Act\n. He pleaded guilty to the second charge and was sentenced by the Court Martial to a reprimand and a fine of $2,000. Given the applicant's guilty plea, and because the second charge was an alternate to the first charge, the military judge ordered a stay of proceedings on the first charge:\nR v Babineau\n, 2011 CM 3009.\n\n[12]\nFollowing his guilty plea, the applicant's case was submitted to the Military Police Credentials Review Board (MPCRB or Board) for an examination as to whether the applicant's actions constitute a breach of the\nMilitary Police Professional Code of Conduct\n(MPPCC or Code). The Board may make any recommendation to the Provost Marshal that is considers appropriate, depending on the circumstances of the case, and must provide written reasons:\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, section 22.04;\nMilitary Police Policies and Technical Procedures\n, c 3, sections 17, 39 and 41. The applicant provided written submissions for the review by a five-member panel (review panel). All of the members found that the applicant had breached the MPPCC. Four out of the five members recommended a 180-day suspension, whereas the fifth member recommended that the applicant's credentials be revoked. Previously, the applicant's supervisor, Major Vouligny, had recommended a 90-day suspension and a 12-month probation.\n\n[13]\nThe case was then referred to the Provost Marshal for a decision. As the military police Commanding Officer (the highest ranked military police officer), he is the ultimate authority when it comes to disciplining members of military police. It was up to him to make the final decision in the applicant's case and he was not bound by the Review Board's recommendations.\n\n[14]\nAfter examining the Review Board's reasons and recommendations, the Provost Marshal told the applicant about his intention to revoke his military police credentials in a letter dated August 28, 2012. The Provost Marshal gave the applicant the opportunity to submit any last written representations or other new relevant documents before making his final decision. After considering the applicant's additional submissions, the Provost Marshal communicated his final decision to revoke his military police credentials on November 30, 2012.\n\n[15]\nThe applicant filed this application for judicial review before this Court on December 28, 2012.\nImpugned decision\n\n[16]\nThe Provost Marshal first noted that the panel did not attach enough weight to a fundamental factor, that is, the leadership that a military police commanding officer must demonstrate.\n\n[17]\nWhile he acknowledged that the applicant's performance was sometimes noteworthy, the Provost Marshal stated that the acts committed by the applicant are not those expected of a member of the Canadian Forces, and especially not of someone who is not only a member of the military police, but an officer who must command other military police officers responsible for enforcing the law in the Canadian Forces. He added the following: [translation] \"I have lost the full confidence that I had in Captain Babineau's ability to carry out his duties as a military police officer, and I believe that his credibility with his subordinates is non-existent\": Respondent's Record, page 508.\n\n[18]\nThe Provost Marshal also noted that Captain Babineau admitted to not knowing that the importation of large capacity magazines was contrary to the\nCriminal Code\nand to theatre standing orders and pleaded guilty at Court Martial even though he has more than 20 years of experience in the Canadian Forces, is a former member of combat arms, a competent investigator with the military police and someone who regularly carries a firearm. In the eyes of the Provost Marshal, breaches to the MPPCC cannot be taken lightly, and it is impossible to justify letting a military police officer keep his credentials when he acted in a manner that would lead to the disqualification of a candidate who was in a similar situation during his or her participation at the Military Police Assessment Centre. In that regard, the Provost Marshal found the following: [translation] \"In my opinion, Captain Babineau was deceitful in those circumstances and that is reflective of an aspect of his character. I cannot resolve the breach with a suspension\": Respondent's Record, page 509.\n\n[19]\nThe last substantive paragraph of the Provost Marshal's notice of intent warrants being reproduced in its entirety for a proper understanding of the substance of his decision:\n[translation]\nAs part of my deliberations in this case, I have raised major concerns regarding the severity of Captain Babineau's conduct. Even though the MPCRB is mandated to examine MPPCC-related issues, it is my duty as Canadian Forces Provost Marshal to consider all of the factors that reflect the abilities of those appointed within the military police force, including a person's leadership. Captain Babineau, by his own admission, is guilty of actions that are directly related to his honesty and integrity. His discredit within the military police force was exacerbated by the publication of his actions in the national media and by his subsequent conviction. Furthermore, I note that Captain Babineau did not acknowledge the severity of that contravention in his guilty plea. To the contrary, he made considerable efforts to justify his actions; he tried to minimize the severity of the offence and challenged the investigation process and the investigator. Rather than admitting his contravention, showing remorse for his actions and apologizing for having been discredited and harming the reputation of his commission and the military police, he claimed that the matter was a minor error and accused others of submitting the case to the MPCRB. The MPCRB determined that Captain Babineau's actions were clearly disreputable and contrary to public interest, and that they could only harm the reputation of the military police. That directly contributed to my decision.\nIssue\n\n[20]\nThe only issue on this application for judicial review is whether the Provost Marshal's decision to revoke the applicant's military police credentials was reasonable.\nAnalysis\n\n[21]\nEven though this Court has never ruled on the standard of review applicable to decisions by the Provost Marshal when the MPPCC is applied, there seems to me to be no doubt that the appropriate standard is reasonableness. First, the applicant does not challenge the fact that he breached subsection 4(l) of the MPPCC; his issue is with the severity of the sanction that was imposed on him by the Provost Marshal. It was a discretionary decision that was based essentially on an assessment of the facts. Furthermore, the Provost Marshal clearly knows the military context and has more expertise than this Court in that area.\n\n[22]\nSecond, the Court has already determined that the standard of review applicable to decisions by the Chief of the Defence Staff in grievance matters is reasonableness. For example, Justice Near (while a member of this Court) stated the following in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). I come to this conclusion after considering the following: the fact that decisions of the CDS are final and binding, except for judicial review under the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7; that the CDS is charged with control and administration of the Canadian Forces and is interpreting its own statute; that the statutory scheme provided the CDS with discretionary power in his determination of such grievances, and that the issues to be addressed are predominantly those of fact or mixed fact and law.\nSee also:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIn my view, the same factors apply when the Provost Marshal makes a decision stemming from the MPPCC. As a result, deference should apply to the Provost Marshal's decision. To the extent that his decision falls within the range of \"possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\", and is the result of an intelligible and transparent process and has justification, this Court will not intervene. Such attitude does not involve, however, an abdication of the responsibilities assigned to the judiciary in its examination of administrative decisions. As the Supreme Court took pains to point out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (at paragraph 48), \"[i]t does not mean that courts are subservient to the determinations of decision makers, or that courts must show blind reverence to their interpretations\", or that they may be content to pay lip service to the concept of reasonableness review while in fact imposing their own view. It is therefore in that perspective that the Provost Marshal's decision must be examined.\n\n[23]\nThe respondent is correct in maintaining that the Provost Marshal was in no way bound by the Review Board's findings or recommendations, but was simply required to consider them:\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, c 22, paragraph 22.04(11);\nMilitary Police Policies and Technical Procedures\n, c 3, sections 17 and 41. However, the Provost Marshal's decision to depart from an almost unanimous recommendation (4 out of 5 members) by the Review Board must be based on solid justification and rely on the evidence in the record. It is in this respect that the Provost Marshal's decision is deficient.\n\n[24]\nThe Provost Marshal first criticizes the applicant for not expressing remorse or recognizing the severity of the offence that he committed. Two comments are required in that respect. First, the severity of the act committed by Captain Babineau must be qualified. First, the fact that he mailed a parcel to Canada that contained magazines, which are devices prohibited by law, was a military offence under section 129 of the\nNational Defence Act\nand not a criminal offence, like the Provost Marshal stated. It is true that a military police officer is expected to have better knowledge of the law than a regular member of the Canadian Forces military and demonstrate, at the very least, more prudence. That being said, the offence committed seems, by in large, quite technical, given the fact that sending magazines of less than five rounds does not constitute an offence. Moreover, the fact that the applicant acted in good faith is not challenged because he never concealed the nature of the shipped merchandise; to the contrary, he explicitly described what was inside the parcel and seems to have packed it in full view of the postmaster, who the respondent did not deem necessary to call as a witness. Captain Babineau's statement that he asked a friend who is a member of the Sûreté du Québec to destroy the magazines once he learned of their illegal nature was also not challenged. Given all of the facts, there is no doubt that the applicant was negligent, but nothing indicates that he acted in bad faith.\n\n[25]\nRegarding his supposed lack of remorse, the evidence in the record tends to demonstrate to the contrary. First, the Court Martial judge considered the fact that Captain Babineau pleaded guilty to the offence that he was accused of as a mitigating factor, and added that he \"showed very clearly that [he is] remorseful and sincerely intend[s] to remain a solid asset within the Canadian Forces\" (Respondent's Record, page 260). Second, the Review Board also disclosed as a mitigating factor that Captain Babineau acknowledged his errors and pleaded guilty at Court Martial. He even took the initiative to take a specialized course on prohibited weapons after the incident with which he was charged, which is some evidence that he recognized his deficiencies and wanted to address them.\n\n[26]\nIt is true that in the observations that he submitted to the Review Board, the applicant argued that the equipment put at the disposal of the Canadian military was not always adequate and he tried to explain why he had sent the magazines by mail. Those statements do not seem to me to reflect a lack of remorse or a willingness to avoid responsibility; to the contrary, they are clearly part of an approach to explain the context in which the offence was committed in a manner to convince the Review Board that he does not deserve an unduly harsh punishment.\n\n[27]\nThe Provost Marshal also seems to challenge the applicant's credibility with his subordinates. However, the evidence demonstrates that he received Personnel Evaluation Reports (PERs) according to which his performance was considered [translation] \"satisfactory\", [translation] \"above average\" or [translation] \"mastered\", even after the offence with which he was charged. Those reports clearly establish that his superiors still had confidence in him. Furthermore, he was kept in his position as Deputy Commander of the Canadian mission to train Afghan police officers despite the charges against him, and resumed his duties as Deputy Commander of the 5th Military Police Company upon his return to Canada.\n\n[28]\nIn its decision, the Court Martial stated the principle that \"any sentence imposed by a court, be it civilian or military, must be adapted to the individual offender and constitute the minimum necessary intervention, since moderation is the bedrock principle of the modern theory of sentencing in Canada\". In this case, I am of the opinion that the sanction imposed by the Provost Marshal is not proportional to the severity of the offence with which the applicant was charged. Four out of five members of the Review Board found that a 180-day suspension, the longest possible suspension under subsection 22.04(11) of the\nQueen's Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces\n, would be appropriate. His immediate superior, Major Stéphane Vouligny, recommended a 90-day suspension and 12-month probation period. The Provost Marshal, by raising considerations that are not supported by the evidence in the record, chose to not accept those recommendations and to impose the most severe sentence, that is, the revocation of his military police credentials. Not only is that sanction not proportional to the severity of the offence, but it is undeniably unreasonable in the circumstances.\n\n[29]\nIt also appears from section 39 regarding the MPPCC that the Review Board can only proceed with a revocation \"only after all other possible recommendations have been considered, and when no other alternative approach may be envisaged\". That same provision also states that the Review Board must make its recommendations based on all relevant factors such as the severity of the violation of the Code, the member's offence history and the existence of mitigating circumstances. Even though that provision applies formally only to the Review Board, it is difficult to understand how the Provost Marshal could ignore it, unless there were perhaps very exceptional circumstances, which is not the case here. At risk of acting arbitrarily, the Provost Marshal's discretion cannot be absolute. If he wanted to depart from the Review Board's recommendations, he was required to provide a convincing explanation for doing so, which he unfortunately failed to do. To the contrary, he relied on grounds that are not supported by the evidence, he did not consider the applicant's clear record and performance evaluations and he overlooked the mitigating circumstances that the Court Martial and the Review Board nonetheless accepted. Under these circumstances, his decision must be set aside to allow him to redetermine the matter on the basis of these reasons.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[30]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, with costs to the applicant, and that the Provost Marshal's decision dated November 30, 2012, is set aside. As a result, the matter it sent back to him for redetermination on the basis of these reasons.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  judiciaire en vertu de l'article 18.1 de la\nLoi sur les Cours fédérales\n, LRC 1985, c F-7, de la décision du Grand Prévôt des Forces canadiennes, le Colonel T.D.
