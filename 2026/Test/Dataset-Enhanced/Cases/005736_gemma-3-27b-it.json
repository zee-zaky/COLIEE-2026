    "[1]\nPhelan, J.\n: The Applicant, a 27 year old female citizen of Turkey, based her refugee protection claim on fear of her ex-boyfriend, fear of Turkish authorities due to her involvement in women's rights organizations and receipt of threats from a Kurdish family.\nA member [Member] of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] denied her claim. This is the judicial review of that claim.\nII.\nFACTS",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant's fear of her ex-boyfriend stemmed from her breaking off the relationship. She outlined a number of physical threats and assaults she suffered at his hands. She also harboured a suspicion that the ex-boyfriend had friends in the Turkish prosecutor's office.",
    "[3]\nThe Applicant also claimed that she was a member of a women's rights group. She said that she and other women were sexually harassed by village guards in a village the women's group had visited. She said that officials in the Ministry of Interior Affairs warned against filing a complaint. She also alleged other incidents while teaching at school. Most of these incidents were not canvassed at her RPD hearing.",
    "[4]\nLastly, the Applicant alleges that she was threatened by the family of a Kurdish woman who she had helped when the woman ran away from her family.",
    "[5]\nThe Applicant made two attempts to postpone the RPD hearing. The first, due to counsel's scheduling conflict, was successful. The second, based on the need to obtain and file documents said to be en route from Turkey, was not successful. The RPD held that the Applicant had sufficient time to obtain the documents.",
    "[6]\nAt the end of the hearing the Member refused to allow the filing of post-hearing documents, again on the basis that the Applicant had from June 2011 to March 22, 2012 to obtain the documents.",
    "[7]\nThe Member determined that the Applicant was not credible with respect to all three aspects of her claim:\n the Member's finding regarding the ex-boyfriend was based on lack of corroborating documents, inconsistencies with her PIF and general incredibility of her story;\n there was no corroboration of her story regarding the women's rights organization; and\n with regard to the Kurdish family, there was a general lack of corroboration and credibility.",
    "[8]\nThe Member also considered the issue of state protection. The Member found that the Applicant has not sufficiently engaged the state for protection - one phone call was not sufficient.\nIII.\nANALYSIS",
    "[9]\nWith respect to credibility findings, the standard of review is reasonableness with considerable deference owed to the trier of fact (\nAguebor v (Canada) Minister of Employment and Immigration (FCA)\n(1993), 160 NR 315, 42 ACWS (3d) 886).\nState protection findings are subject to the reasonableness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 413).\nThe issue of refusals to grant time are discretionary matters but must be assessed as to procedural fairness on a correctness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 195).",
    "[10]\nI can find no basis for overturning the RPD's findings in this area. The Member considered contradictory evidence, applied a reasonable plausibility analysis and was in a far better position than this Court to assess general credibility.",
    "[11]\nIn my view, the state protection analysis is unassailable and is a complete answer to the Applicant's refugee protection claim. A single complaint to police, in these circumstances, is not a sound basis to find that the Applicant had overturned the presumption of state protection.",
    "[12]\nThe decision not to adjourn (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 921) and not to admit post-hearing documents is discretionary (Z\nheng v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2011 FC 1096, 208 ACWS (3d) 167). The Member had a proper rationale for his decision. The Applicant failed to establish the materiality of the documents said to be en route.",
    "[13]\nAt the hearing before this Court, the Applicant did not seek to supplement the record by introducing the documents as evidence that there had been a breach of natural justice by the refusal to admit them at the hearing.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[14]\nFor these reasons, this judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[15]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Phelan\n[Translation]: The applicant, a 27-year-old Turkish national, based her request for asylum on fear of her ex-boyfriend, fear of the Turkish authorities because of her participation in the activities of women's rights organizations and threats received from a Kurdish family.\nA commissioner [the commissioner] of the Refugee Protection Section [RPD] rejected his asylum application. This is about judicial review of this decision.\nII.\nFACTS [2]\nThe plaintiff fears her ex-boyfriend because she broke up with him. She stated a number of threats and assaults on his part. She also said she feared that her ex-boyfriend had friends in the Turkish prosecutor's office. [3]\nThe plaintiff also claimed to belong to a women's rights group. She alleged that she and other women had been subjected to sexual harassment by guards in a village the organization visited. She said officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs had warned her not to file a complaint. She also alleged other incidents that occurred while she was teaching at school. Most of the incidents in question were not mentioned during his hearing before the RPD. [4]\nFinally, the plaintiff alleges that she received threats from the family of a Kurdish woman to whom she had helped when she fled. [5]\nThe applicant twice requested that the hearing before the RPD be postponed. The first postponement, requested because her lawyer had a scheduling conflict, was granted. The second, requested for the obtaining and production of documents which, according to allegations, had been sent from Turkey, but had not yet been received, was not granted. The RPD stated that the applicant had sufficient time to obtain the documents. [6]\nAt the end of the hearing, the commissioner refused the production of documents presented after the hearing, again on the grounds that the applicant had from June 2011 until March 22, 2012 to obtain the documents. [7]\nThe Commissioner concluded that the applicant was not credible with respect to all three aspects of her refugee claim.\n the commissioner's conclusion regarding her ex-boyfriend was based on the absence of corroborating documents, inconsistencies with his FRP and the general implausibility of his account;\n the lack of evidence to corroborate his assertions regarding the women's rights organization;\n the general lack of corroborative evidence and credibility regarding the Kurdish family. [8]\nThe commissioner also considered the issue of state protection. He ruled that the plaintiff had not taken sufficient steps to obtain state protection - a phone call is not enough.\nIII.\nANALYSIS [9]\nWith respect to credibility findings, the applicable standard of review is that of reasonableness requiring considerable deference to the trier of fact (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 413).\nThe refusal to grant time is a discretionary matter, which must however be assessed from the perspective of procedural fairness under the standard of correctness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 195). [10]\nI see no reason to overturn the RPD's conclusions in this area. The Commissioner considered the conflicting evidence, applied a reasonable air of reality analysis, and was in a much better position than the Court to assess the overall credibility of the Applicant. [11]\nI find that the state protection analysis is unassailable and fully addresses the Applicant's request for asylum. A simple police report, in these circumstances, does not constitute a solid basis for establishing that the plaintiff had rebutted the presumption of state protection. [12]\nThe decision not to adjourn the hearing (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 921), and not to admit into evidence documents presented after the hearing is discretionary (Z\nheng c Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2011 FC 1096, 208 ACWS (3d) 167). The commissioner clearly justified his decision. The plaintiff has not established the importance of the documents that were allegedly on the way. [13]\nDuring the hearing before the Court, the Applicant did not seek to supplement her case by presenting the documents as proof that there had been a breach of natural justice when the Commissioner refused to admit them into evidence at the hearing.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION [14]\nFor these reasons, the judicial review is dismissed. There are no questions to be certified.\nJUDGMENT [15]\nTHE COURT RULES that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

There is no question for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n[15]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Phelan\n[Traduction]: La demanderesse, une ressortissante de la Turquie âgée de 27 ans, a fondé sa demande d'asile sur la crainte de son ex-petit ami, la crainte des autorités turques à cause de sa participation aux activités d'organisations de défense des droits des femmes et les menaces reçues d'une famille kurde.\nUn commissaire [le commissaire] de la Section de la protection des réfugiés [SPR] a rejeté sa demande d'asile. Il s'agit ici du contrôle judiciaire de cette décision.\nII.\nFAITS\n[2]\nLa demanderesse craint son ex-petit ami du fait qu'elle a rompu avec lui. Elle a énoncé un certain nombre de menaces et de voies de faits de la part de celui-ci. Elle a aussi dit craindre que son ex-petit ami ait des amis au bureau du procureur de la Turquie.\n[3]\nLa demanderesse a également prétendu appartenir à un groupe de défense des droits des femmes. Elle a soutenu que d'autres femmes et elle avaient été victimes de harcèlement sexuel par des gardes d'un village que l'organisation avait visité. Elle a précisé que des responsables du ministère des Affaires intérieures l'avaient avertie de ne pas déposer de plainte. Elle a aussi allégué d'autres incidents survenus pendant qu'elle donnait ses cours à l'école. La plupart des incidents en question n'ont pas été mentionnés lors de son audience devant la SPR.\n[4]\nEnfin, la demanderesse allègue qu'elle a reçu des menaces de la part de la famille d'une femme kurde à qui elle avait apporté son aide lorsque celle-ci s'était enfuie.\n[5]\nLa demanderesse a demandé deux fois la remise de l'audience devant la SPR. La première remise, demandée parce que son avocate avait un conflit d'horaire, a été accordée. La seconde, demandée pour l'obtention et la production de documents qui, selon les allégations, auraient été envoyés de la Turquie, mais n'auraient pas encore été reçus, n'a pas été accordée. La SPR a affirmé que la demanderesse avait eu suffisamment de temps pour obtenir les documents.\n[6]\nÀ la fin de l'audience, le commissaire a refusé la production de documents présentés après l'audience, encore au motif que la demanderesse avait eu du mois de juin 2011 jusqu'au 22 mars 2012 pour obtenir les documents.\n[7]\nLe commissaire a conclu que la demanderesse n'était pas crédible à l'égard des trois aspects de sa demande d'asile.\n la conclusion du commissaire concernant son ex-petit ami reposait sur l'absence de documents corroborants, des incohérences par rapport à son FRP et l'invraisemblance générale de son récit;\n l'absence d'élément pour corroborer ses affirmations concernant l'organisation de défense des droits des femmes;\n l'absence générale d'éléments corroborants et de crédibilité en ce qui concerne la famille kurde.\n[8]\nLe commissaire a également pris en considération la question de la protection de l'État. Il a jugé que la demanderesse n'avait pas fait suffisamment de démarches pour obtenir la protection de l'État - un appel téléphonique ne suffit pas.\nIII.\nANALYSE\n[9]\nEn ce qui concerne les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité, la norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la décision raisonnable appelant une déférence considérable envers le juge des faits (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4th) 413).\nLe refus d'accorder un délai est une question discrétionnaire, qui doit toutefois être évalué sous l'angle de l'équité procédurale selon la norme de la décision correcte (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 195).\n[10]\nJe ne vois aucun motif d'infirmer les conclusions de la SPR dans ce domaine. Le commissaire a pris en considération les éléments de preuve contradictoires, a fait appel à une analyse raisonnable de la vraisemblance et était beaucoup mieux placé que la Cour pour évaluer la crédibilité générale de la demanderesse.\n[11]\nJ'estime que l'analyse de la protection de l'État est inattaquable et répond complètement à la demande d'asile de la demanderesse. Une simple plainte à la police, dans ces circonstances, ne constitue pas un fondement solide pour établir que la demanderesse avait réfuté la présomption de la protection de l'État.\n[12]\nLa décision de ne pas ajourner l'audience (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 921), et de ne pas admettre en preuve les documents présentés après l'audience est discrétionnaire (Z\nheng c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)\n, 2011 CF 1096, 208 ACWS (3d) 167). Le commissaire a bien justifié sa décision. La demanderesse n'a pas établi l'importance des documents qui, selon les allégations, étaient en chemin.\n[13]\nPendant l'audience devant la Cour, la demanderesse n'a pas cherché à compléter son dossier en présentant les documents comme preuve qu'il y avait eu manquement à la justice naturelle quand le commissaire avait refusé de les admettre en preuve à l'audience.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\n[14]\nPour ces motifs, le contrôle judiciaire est rejeté. Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.\nJUGEMENT\n[15]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n[End of document]",
