    "[1]\nMcGillis, J.\n: Counsel for the applicants has brought a motion seeking, among other things, an order directing the Minister of National Health and Welfare (\"Minister\") to produce a certified copy of the chemistry and manufacturing section of the new drug submission of Apotex Inc. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) for various forms and dosages of cisapride monohydrate.",
    "[2]\nThe question of the production of a new drug submission, which has been filed by a pharmaceutical company with the Minister on a confidential basis, was considered by Rothstein, J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), in the following terms at p. 104:\n\"In the proceedings before me, there was no express nor specific affidavit evidence indicating how the information sought would be relevant to the infringement which is the main issue before this court. The information is not relevant to the compulsory licence of Novopharm nor do the items sought appear relevant to the agreement between Apotex and Novopharm. If a party asks for a new drug submission to be produced, there must be strong evidence as to why it is necessary. A recitation of regulations as was contained in the affidavit material in this case is insufficient.\n. . . . .\n\"I do not say that a new drug submission could never be relevant to a prohibition application based on infringement. However, the onus is on the applicant to show in strong terms that it is relevant and necessary. I note in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 63 F.T.R. 197 (T.D.), McGillis, J., states, at p. 305:\n'The perceived confidentiality of information flowing from a drug manufacturer to the Department of National Health and Welfare is a cornerstone of the system pertaining to the processing of new drug submissions and the issuance of notices of compliance. For this system to function effectively, the confidential nature of the relationship ought to be honoured and maintained to the extent possible.'\n\"My approach, which would be to require the applicants to demonstrate, clearly and persuasively in the affidavit material, that production of the new drug submission is essential and relevant to the issue of infringement, is consistent with the dicta of McGillis, J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 302 (F.C.A.).",
    "[3]\nIn the case at bar, the evidence tendered on the motion establishes that Apotex has provided information, under s. 5(3) of the\nPatented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations\n, SOR/93-133 (\"\nRegulations\n\"), in its detailed statement of the legal and factual basis for its allegation of non-infringement which probably differs materially from the confidential information in its new drug submission filed with the Minister.",
    "[4]\nUnder the regulatory scheme concerning the issuance of a notice of compliance, the new drug submission, the notice of allegation and the detailed statement of the legal and factual basis for the allegation are inextricably linked. (See ss. 4, 5 and 6 of the\nRegulations\n) Indeed, as the Court of Appeal indicated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the prohibition proceedings contemplated by the\nRegulations\nare directed solely to a determination of whether the Minister may issue a notice of compliance. As such, the \"... decision must turn on whether there are allegations by the generic company sufficiently substantiated to support a conclusion for administrative purposes (the issue of a notice of compliance) that the applicant's patent would not be infringed if the generic's product is put on the market.\" (p. 599) The Court of Appeal also reinforced the importance of the notice of allegation in the regulatory scheme in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  regulations clearly allow the Minister, absent a timely application under s. 6, to issue a notice of compliance on the basis of the allegations in the notice of allegation, it would seem that on the hearing of such an application, at least where the notice has alleged non-infringement, the court should start from the proposition that the allegations of fact in the notice of allegation are true except to the extent that the contrary has been shown by the applicant.\"",
    "[5]\nGiven the compelling evidence adduced before me concerning probable material differences between the new drug submission and the detailed statement supporting the notice of allegation, I am satisfied that the information in the new drug submission may be highly relevant to arguments concerning infringement which counsel for the applicants wishes to advance in the prohibition proceedings under s. 6(1) of the\nRegulations.\nIn the circumstances, I have concluded that the Minister ought to be required to produce the relevant portions of the new drug submission. Since the judge presiding at the hearing of the prohibition application will be required to decide the issues arising from a material discrepancy between the information in the new drug submission and the detailed statement supporting the allegations, I have decided to refrain from making any further comments in this matter. I note that the material to be produced by the Minister will be covered by the confidentiality order in these proceedings.",
    "[6]\nThe motion is granted. There are no special reasons under rule 1618 for making an award of costs.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Steven C. McMinniman/kaw\n[End of document]"
