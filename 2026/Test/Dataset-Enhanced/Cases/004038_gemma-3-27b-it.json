    "[1]\nJudge Harrington\n: Ms. Stephens, a citizen of Saint Vincent, was admitted to Canada as a visitor in 2001. She did not extend her status when it expired and has been without status since 2002.",
    "[2]\nHis request for an exemption from the requirement to submit his application for permanent residence outside of Canada on humanitarian grounds (CH application), contrary to the general rule, was refused by an immigration officer. It is this decision which is the subject of judicial review before this Court.",
    "[3]\nThree points in dispute were raised during the hearing:\n Ms. Stephens' degree of establishment in Canada;\n Availability of place to live in Saint Vincent; and\n Ms. Stephens' fear for her well-being if she is forced to return to Saint Vincent.",
    "[4]\nA decision in the CH applications stream must weigh an assessment of Ms. Stephens' degree of establishment in Canada against a projection of the situation she would face if she returned to Saint Vincent. There is no question of fear being sufficiently pronounced to support the application of section 96 or section 97. Citizenship and Immigration Canada's Guide IP 5, entitled Application by Immigrants to Canada on H&C Grounds, instead discusses unusual and unjustified or excessive hardship.",
    "[5]\nIt is clear that, even before the Supreme Court's ruling\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[6]\nThe Agent found that Ms. Stephens demonstrated good involvement in Canada. She has a family here including her mother and brother, she has improved herself and is dedicated to her community.\nI note that the applicant's establishment is as expected of a person wanting to live in Canada independently. It is normal to create social connections in those around you. His involvement in the church and his community can also continue in his country. I therefore conclude that the applicant's establishment, although good, is not exceptional and does not in itself justify an exemption from submitting her application for residence abroad.",
    "[7]\nIn the context, it is obvious that the Agent does not question that Ms. Stephens is well established in Canada. Certainly, this is not a waiver of the Agent's obligation to consider the situation Ms. Stephens would face if she returned to Saint Vincent.",
    "[8]\nAs discussed by Judge Teitelbaum in the judgment\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm. L.R. (3d) 311, at paragraph 15:\n[...] The officer reasonably concluded that the applicants' level of settlement did not exceed what is reasonable to expect of people who have lived in a country for four and a half years. Furthermore, the degree of establishment is only one of the factors to be considered in a CH application and is not in itself determinative (<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> alleged that she would no longer have a place to live if she returned to Saint Vincent.

    "[9] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[10]\nFinally, it may be that the general situation in Saint Vincent suggests a degree of poverty and criminal violence, but Ms. Stephens did not relate these conditions to her personal situation. Fundamentally, the argument is really that the Officer should have given more weight to some factors and less to others. However, as noted by Justice Blais in the decision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm. L.R. (3rd) 129, at paragraph 13:\nI would like to repeat once again that the Court cannot intervene lightly in the exercise of the discretionary power of immigration officers. The decision regarding an application based on humanitarian grounds must be based on an analysis of the facts and the weighing of numerous factors. I find that the officer took into consideration all the relevant factors with regard to the humanitarian and compassionate grounds and that he made no error justifying the intervention of the Court.",
    "[11]\nThe question to be decided by the Agent was the following: is the particular case of Ms. Stephens such that the difficulty she would suffer if she were to apply for permanent residence from Saint Vincent would be unusual and unjustified or excessive? The Officer's decision, that she would not, was reasonable. His reasoning is clearly stated and his decision does not merit the intervention of this Court.\nPRESCRIPTION",

She did not extend her status when it expired and has been without status since 2002. [2]\nHer application for an exemption from the requirement to file her permanent residence application based on humanitarian and compassion considerations (HC application) from outside Canada, in derogation to the general rule, was denied by an immigration officer. That decision is challenged by this judicial review application before this Court. [3]\nThree points at issue were raised at the hearing:\n Ms. Stephens' degree of establishment in Canada;\n The availability of a place to live in Saint Vincent; and\n Ms. Stephens' fear for her well-being should she be required to return to Saint Vincent. [4]\nAs regards decisions on HC applications, one must weigh Ms. Stephens' degree of establishment in Canada against an assessment of the situation that she would face if she were to return to Saint Vincent. The issue of a sufficiently pronounced fear does not arise here, hence neither section 96 nor section 97 apply. Citizenship and Immigration Canada's IP 5 manual, entitled \"Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds,\" discusses unusual hardship rather than unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. [5]\nIt is clear that even before the Supreme Court's decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). [6]\nThe officer determined that Ms. Stephens is well established in Canada. She has a family here, including her mother and brother; she has improved herself and is devoted within her community.\n[translation]\nI note that the applicant's establishment is that of a person wishing to live autonomously in Canada. It is normal to create social ties in one's circle. She can also pursue her involvement with the church and her community in her country. I therefore find that the applicant's establishment, while good, is not exceptional and does not in itself justify exempting her from the duty of applying for permanent residence from abroad. [7]\nIn this context, it is apparent that the officer is not questioning the fact that Ms. Stephens is well established in Canada. Certainly, it is not a question of exempting the officer's obligation to assess the situation that Ms. Stephens will face if she were removed to Saint Vincent. [8]\nAs Justice Teitelbaum discussed in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 311, at paragraph 15:\n. . . The Officer reasonably concluded that the applicants' level of establishment does not exceed what is reasonably expected after having resided in the country for a period of four and a half years. Moreover, the degree of establishment is only one factor to be considered in an H&C assessment and is not in itself determinative (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CanLII), 2004 FC 785;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that she would no longer have a place to live if she were to return to Saint Vincent. While the record is far from clear as to whether she could return to the place where she lived before, since it is possible that the family property has been sold, no evidence was adduced suggesting that she would no longer have anywhere to live in Saint Vincent, whether it be with her siblings or not. [10]\nFinally, it is possible that the general situation in Saint Vincent reveals a degree of poverty and criminal violence, but Ms. Stephens did not relate these factors to her personal situation. Fundamentally the argument is really that the officer should have assigned more weight to some factors and less to others. However, as noted by Justice Blais in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3rd) 129, at paragraph 13:\n\"Once again, I want to reiterate the fact that this Court cannot lightly interfere with the discretion given to immigration officers. The H & C decision was a fact driven analysis, requiring the weighing of many factors. I find that the immigration officer considered all of the relevant and appropriate factors from a humanitarian and compassionate perspective, and did not commit any errors which would justify this Court's interference.\" [11]\nThe issue for the officer to decide is the following: is the particular situation of Ms. Stephens such that the hardship that she would experience if she were required to apply for permanent residence from Saint Vincent would be unusual, undeserved or disproportionate? The officer's decision, that it would not be, was reasonable. Her reasoning is clearly stated and her decision does not warrant the intervention of this Court.\nORDER [12]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that\nthe application for judicial review be dismissed.

Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n[1]\nLe juge Harrington\n: Madame Stephens, une citoyenne de Saint Vincent, a été admise au Canada à titre de visiteur en 2001. Elle n'a pas prorogé son statut à l'expiration de celui-ci et est sans statut depuis l'année 2002.\n[2]\nSa demande pour une dispense de l'exigence de présenter sa demande de résidence permanente à l'extérieur du Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire (demande CH), contrairement à la règle générale, a été refusée par une agente d'immigration. C'est cette décision qui fait l'objet du contrôle judiciaire devant cette Cour.\n[3]\nTrois points en litige ont été soulevés lors de l'audience:\n Le degré d'établissement de Mme Stephens au Canada;\n Disponibilité d'endroit pour vivre à Saint Vincent; et\n La crainte de Mme Stephens par rapport à son bien-être si elle est obligée de retourner à Saint Vincent.\n[4]\nUne décision dans le volet des demandes CH doit soupeser l'appréciation du degré d'établissement de Mme Stephens au Canada contre une projection de la situation à laquelle elle ferait face si elle est retournée à Saint Vincent. Il n'est pas question d'une crainte assez prononcée pour appuyer l'application de l'article 96 ou de l'article 97. Le Guide IP 5 de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada, intitulé  Demande présentée par des immigrants au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire , discute plutôt des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives.\n[5]\nIl est clair que, même avant l'arrêt de la Cour suprême\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[6]\nL'Agente a trouvé que Mme Stephens démontre une bonne implication au Canada. Elle a une famille ici dans laquelle comptent sa mère et son frère, elle s'est améliorée et se dévoue au sein de sa communauté.\nJe note que l'établissement de la requérante est tel qu'attendu d'une personne voulant vivre au Canada de façon autonome. Il est normal de créer des liens sociaux dans son entourage. Son implication au sein de l'église et de sa communauté peut également se poursuivre dans son pays. Je conclu donc que l'établissement de la requérante bien qu'il soit bon, n'est exceptionnel et ne justifie pas à lui seul une dispense de présenter sa demande de résidence à l'étranger.\n[7]\nDans le contexte, il est évident que l'Agente ne remet point en question que Mme Stephens est bien établie au Canada. Certainement, il n'est pas ici question d'une dispense de l'obligation de l'Agente de considérer la situation à laquelle Mme Stephens ferait face si elle serait retournée à Saint Vincent.\n[8]\nTel que discuté par le juge Teitelbaum dans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 311, au paragraphe 15:\n[...] L'agente a raisonnablement conclu que le degré d'établissement des demandeurs ne dépassait pas ce qu'il est raisonnable de s'attendre de personnes qui ont habité dans un pays pendant quatre ans et demi. De plus, le degré d'établissement est seulement l'un des facteurs dont il faut tenir compte dans une demande CH et il n'est pas en soi déterminant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  allégué qu'elle n'aurait plus d'endroit pour vivre si elle retourne à Saint Vincent. Bien que le dossier porte à confusion quant à savoir si elle pourrait retourner vivre où elle a vécu auparavant, puisqu'il se peut que la propriété familiale a été vendue, aucune preuve n'a été présentée qui laisserait savoir qu'elle n'aurait plus d'endroit pour vivre à Saint Vincent, que ce soit avec sa fratrie ou non.\n[10]\nFinalement, il se peut que la situation générale à Saint Vincent suggère un degré de pauvreté et de violence criminelle, mais Mme Stephens n'a pas lié ces conditions à sa situation personnelle. Fondamentalement, l'argument est vraiment que l'Agente aurait dû accorder plus de poids à certains facteurs et moins à d'autres. Cependant, tel que noté par le juge Blais dans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3rd) 129, au paragraphe 13:\nJe tiens à répéter encore une fois que la Cour ne peut intervenir à la légère dans l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire des agents d'immigration. La décision concernant une demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire doit reposer sur une analyse des faits et sur la pondération de nombreux facteurs. J'estime que l'agent a pris en considération tous les facteurs pertinents au regard des motifs d'ordre humanitaire et qu'il n'a commis aucune erreur justifiant l'intervention de la Cour.\n[11]\nLa question à trancher par l'Agente était la suivante: est-ce que le cas particulier à Mme Stephens est tel que la difficulté qu'elle subirait si elle devait faire sa demande de résidence permanente à partir de Saint Vincent serait inhabituelle et injustifiée ou excessive ? La décision de l'Agente, qu'elle ne le serait pas, était raisonnable. Son raisonnement est clairement énoncé et sa décision ne mérite pas l'intervention de cette Cour.\nORDONNANCE\n[12]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée.

      "Respondents": [
        "Ms. Stephens’ degree of establishment in Canada, while good, is not exceptional and does not justify an exemption from applying for permanent residence from abroad.",
        "There is no evidence to suggest Ms. Stephens would be without a place to live in Saint Vincent, even if the family homestead was sold.",

        "The immigration officer considered all relevant factors in the humanitarian and compassionate assessment.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed that a humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application requires a balancing of the applicant’s establishment in Canada against the hardships they would face if returned to their country of origin, and that the threshold for granting relief is 'unusual, unjustified or excessive hardship,' not simply hardship.",
      "The court found the immigration officer’s assessment of Ms. Stephens’ degree of establishment in Canada to be reasonable, acknowledging her family ties and community involvement, but ultimately concluding her establishment was not 'exceptional' enough to warrant an exemption from applying for permanent residence from abroad.",
      "The court relied on precedent (Teitelbaum J. in *Immigration Law Reporter*) to support the finding that four and a half years of residence does not automatically equate to exceptional establishment, and that establishment is only one factor in the H&C assessment.",
      "The court dismissed the argument regarding a lack of housing in Saint Vincent, finding the record unclear and no evidence presented to demonstrate Ms. Stephens would be without accommodation.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the general conditions in Saint Vincent (poverty and crime) constituted hardship specific to Ms. Stephens, as she did not demonstrate how these conditions personally affected her.",
      "The court deferred to the immigration officer’s discretionary power, citing Justice Blais’s statement that courts should not lightly interfere with such decisions, provided the officer considered all relevant factors and provided reasoned analysis, which the court found to be the case here.",
      "The court ultimately determined the officer’s decision – that Ms. Stephens’ potential hardship did not rise to the level of 'unusual, unjustified or excessive' – was reasonable and did not warrant judicial intervention."

      "The application for judicial review was dismissed.",
