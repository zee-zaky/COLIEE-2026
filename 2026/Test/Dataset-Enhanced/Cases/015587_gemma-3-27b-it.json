    "[13]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted. The matter is referred back to the Immigration Refugee Board for reconsideration before a different member of the Board's Refugee Protection Division. No question for certification has been proposed and the Court finds that none arises.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant seeks judicial review of the decision, dated July 21, 2011, by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) concluded that under sections 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), the applicant was neither a Convention refugee (\nUnited Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] R.T. Can. No. 6) nor a person to be protected. For the reasons set out below, the request is granted.\nThe facts [2]\nThe applicant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He claims to fear persecution because of his political opinions. He explains that his troubles began when the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) began recruiting young people for its army. In 1997, the AFDL attempted to recruit the applicant's brother. Refusing to enlist in the army, his brother was killed. This is what led the plaintiff to campaign against forced recruitment. He met with other young people belonging to the same church to denounce forced recruitment. [3]\nThe applicant claims to have, on December 14, 2008, organized a meeting with other young people in a bistro. When soldiers arrived, the plaintiff denounced the forced recruitment. He was arrested 11 days later and put in prison. He was released on January 1, 2009, and fled the same day from the DRC (first going to Rwanda, then to South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico before arriving in Canada). He arrived in Canada on April 26, 2009 and requested asylum upon his arrival. [4]\nIn the reasons for its decision of July 15, 2011, the Commission concluded that the applicant lacked credibility. The Commission argues that it did not believe that the applicant would have put himself and 15 other young people in danger by denouncing forced recruitment, in a public place, and in the presence of soldiers. The Commission recalled that, according to his testimony, the applicant had previously been afraid to speak out for fear of being arrested, or killed like his brother. [5]\nThe Commission argued that because it did not find the applicant's testimony credible, it gave no weight to the documentary evidence, in this case a letter from a priest who affirmed that the applicant was indeed in danger, as well as an arrest warrant for the applicant who was accused of insulting the government. The applicant therefore had his asylum application rejected.\nStandard of review and question to be decided [6]\nThe issue is whether the Commission's decision is reasonable:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nAnalysis [7]\nThe Commission's conclusions regarding the credibility of the applicant deserve deference and it is open to the Commission to conclude that the testimony is implausible to the extent that it bases this on reason and common sense:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CAF). But the Court must intervene when the Commission concludes that testimony is implausible based on conclusions that cannot reasonably be drawn from the evidence that has been produced. In this case, the Commission's unfavorable decision is based on the sole implausibility that it was able to identify. Such a conclusion is arbitrary and does not take into account the evidence produced before the Commission. The decision must therefore be annulled. [8]\nThe Commission clearly found it implausible that the applicant, an intelligent and educated young man, aware of the risks to which he exposed himself by denouncing forced recruitment, nevertheless decided to speak in public, in the presence of soldiers, thereby putting himself and his young comrades in danger. This in no way allows us to conclude that such behavior is implausible. Most asylum seekers who cite fear of persecution for their political opinions have denounced a brutal regime, while being aware of the risks to which this exposed them. The authenticity of a political belief is not measured by the intelligence of the applicant, or his studies; any more than it can be assessed with regard to a vague criterion of rationality. History, including recent news, clearly shows that, viewed from a rational point of view, the most courageous political opposition can appear reckless. As Justice James Hugessen said, in the judgment\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The argument that an action is implausible simply because it may prove dangerous for the person who commits it out of political commitment has never been particularly convincing [\nsic\n]. [9]\nAt the hearing, the Commission asked the applicant to explain why he had made comments to this effect, knowing that he was putting himself in danger. Here is the response given by the applicant, as it appears in the transcript of the hearing proceedings (certified court record, at paragraph 125):\nI managed to carry out this act because, well, I was already at the end of my rope or else the ideas were swirling around inside me. So I arrived to thwart this action so that we could not proceed with the recruitment of young people. Because I had not accepted seeing these young people die while I was alive and I could see it, witnessing the death of these young people. [10]\nThe Commission did not take into account the explanation given by the applicant. She only found it improbable that he would put himself and other young people in danger. However, as the applicant explained, they were all already in danger since they risked being recruited by force. This is what led the plaintiff to speak out. [11]\nThe Commission further ignored the fact that the applicant's testimony was corroborated by a warrant for his arrest for insulting the government; the Commission only said that it gave no weight to this document since the applicant did not appear credible. However, with regard to the credibility of the testimony given by the applicant, the mandate in question was of great relevance. The Commission cannot question the credibility of a testimony without taking into account the corroborating evidence, and then dismiss the evidence produced by the applicant, based on the conclusion it reached regarding its credibility. [12]\nThe application for judicial review is granted.\nJUDGMENT [13]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that the\napplication for judicial review is granted. The matter is referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board for reconsideration by another member of the Refugee Protection Division. No questions for certification have been proposed and the Court finds that none arise.\n[End of document]"

Can. no 6) ni une personne à protéger. Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, il est fait droit à la demande.\nLes faits\n[2]\nLe demandeur est un citoyen de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC). Il affirme craindre d'être persécuté du fait de ses opinions politiques. Il explique que ses ennuis ont commencé lorsque l'Alliance des Forces démocratiques pour la libération du Congo (AFDL) a commencé à recruter des jeunes pour son armée. En 1997, l'AFDL a tenté de recruter le frère du demandeur. Refusant de s'enrôler dans l'armée, son frère a été tué. C'est ce qui amena le demandeur à militer contre le recrutement de force. Il se réunissait avec d'autres jeunes appartenant à la même église, pour dénoncer le recrutement forcé.\n[3]\nLe demandeur affirme avoir, le 14 décembre 2008, organisé dans un bistro une réunion avec d'autres jeunes. Lorsque des soldats sont arrivés, le demandeur a dénoncé le recrutement forcé. Il est, 11 jours plus tard, arrêté et mis en prison. Il est libéré le 1er janvier 2009, et s'enfuit le même jour de la RDC (se rendant d'abord au Rwanda, puis en Afrique du Sud, au Brésil, en Argentine et au Mexique avant d'arriver au Canada). Il arrive au Canada le 26 avril 2009 et demande asile dès son arrivée.\n[4]\nDans les motifs de sa décision du 15 juillet 2011, la Commission conclut au manque de crédibilité du demandeur. La Commission fait valoir qu'elle ne croyait pas que le demandeur se serait mis en péril, lui et 15 autres jeunes, en dénonçant le recrutement forcé, dans un lieu public, et en présence de soldats. La Commission a rappelé que, selon son témoignage, le demandeur avait avant cela craint de prendre la parole par peur d'être arrêté, ou tué comme l'avait été son frère.\n[5]\nLa Commission a fait valoir que n'ayant pas jugé crédible le témoignage du demandeur, elle n'accordait aucun poids aux preuves documentaires, en l'occurrence une lettre émanant d'un prêtre qui affirmait que le demandeur était effectivement en danger, ainsi qu'un mandat d'arrestation visant le demandeur à qui l'on reprochait des insultes au gouvernement. Le demandeur a donc vu rejeter sa demande d'asile.\nNorme de contrôle et question à trancher\n[6]\nLa question en litige est de savoir si la décision de la Commission est raisonnable:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nAnalyse\n[7]\nLes conclusions de la Commission quant à la crédibilité du demandeur appellent la déférence et il est loisible à la Commission de conclure à l'invraisemblance d'un témoignage dans la mesure où elle se fonde en cela sur la raison et le bon sens:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF). Mais, la Cour doit intervenir lorsque la Commission conclut à l'invraisemblance d'un témoignage en se fondant sur des conclusions que l'on ne peut pas raisonnablement tirées des preuves qui ont été produites. En l'espèce, la décision défavorable de la Commission est fondée sur l'unique invraisemblance qu'elle a pu relever. Pareille conclusion est arbitraire et ne tient pas compte des éléments de preuve produits devant la Commission. La décision doit par conséquent être annulée.\n[8]\nLa Commission a manifestement trouvé invraisemblable que le demandeur, jeune homme intelligent et instruit, conscient des risques auxquels il s'exposait en dénonçant le recrutement forcé, ait néanmoins décidé de prendre la parole en public, en présence de soldats, se mettant par là même en danger, lui et ses jeunes camarades. Cela ne permet aucunement de conclure à l'invraisemblance d'un tel comportement. La plupart des demandeurs d'asile qui invoquent la crainte d'être persécutés du fait de leurs opinions politiques ont dénoncé un régime brutal, tout en étant conscients des risques auxquels cela les exposait. L'authenticité d'une conviction politique ne se mesure pas en fonction de l'intelligence du demandeur, ou de ses études; pas plus qu'elle ne peut être appréciée au regard d'un vague critère de rationalité. L'histoire, y compris l'actualité récente montre bien que, envisagée d'un point de vue rationnel, l'opposition politique la plus courageuse peut paraître téméraire. Comme le juge James Hugessen l'a dit, dans le jugement\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  L'argument voulant qu'une action soit invraisemblable simplement parce qu'elle peut se révéler dangereuse pour celui qui la commet par engagement politique, n'a jamais été particulièrement convaincante [\nsic\n]. \n[9]\nÀ l'audience, la Commission a demandé au demandeur d'expliquer pourquoi il avait proféré des propos en ce sens, sachant qu'il se mettait en danger. Voici la réponse qu'a donnée le demandeur, telle qu'elle figure dans la transcription des débats de l'audience (dossier certifié du tribunal, au paragraphe 125):\nJe suis arrivé à poser cet acte parce que, bon, j'étais déjà à bout ou bien les idées s'agitaient en foule en-dedans de moi. Alors je suis arrivé pour contrecarrer cette action pour que l'on ne puisse pas procéder au recrutement des jeunes. Parce que je n'avais pas accepté de voir mourir ces jeunes pendant que j'étais en vie et que je pouvais le voir, assister à la mort de ces jeunes.\n[10]\nLa Commission n'a pas tenu compte de l'explication donnée par le demandeur. Elle a seulement jugé invraisemblable qu'il se mette ainsi en danger, lui et d'autres jeunes. Or, comme le demandeur l'a expliqué, ils se trouvaient tous déjà en péril puisqu'ils risquaient d'être recrutés de force. C'est cela qui a amené le demandeur à s'exprimer.\n[11]\nLa Commission n'a en outre tenu aucun compte du fait que le témoignage du demandeur était corroboré par un mandat d'arrestation lancé contre lui pour [traduction]  insultes au gouvernement ; la Commission a seulement dit qu'elle n'accordait aucun poids à ce document étant donné que le demandeur ne lui paraissait pas crédible. Or, en ce qui concerne la crédibilité du témoignage livré par le demandeur, le mandat en question était d'une grande pertinence. La Commission ne saurait mettre en doute la crédibilité d'un témoignage sans tenir compte des preuves corroborantes, puis écarter les éléments de preuve produits par le demandeur, en se fondant sur la conclusion à laquelle elle est parvenue quant à sa crédibilité.\n[12]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie.\nJUGEMENT\n[13]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que la\ndemande de contrôle judiciaire soit accueillie. L'affaire est renvoyée à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié pour réexamen par un autre commissaire de la Section de la protection des réfugiés. Aucune question à certifier n'a été proposée et la Cour estime qu'aucune ne se pose.\n[End of document]",

No question for certification has been proposed and the Court finds that none arises.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant seeks judicial review of the decision, dated July 21, 2011, by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) concluded that under sections 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), the applicant was neither a Convention refugee (\nUnited Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] R.T. Can. No. 6) nor a person to be protected. For the reasons set out below, the request is granted.\nThe facts [2]\nThe applicant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He claims to fear persecution because of his political opinions. He explains that his troubles began when the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) began recruiting young people for its army. In 1997, the AFDL attempted to recruit the applicant's brother. Refusing to enlist in the army, his brother was killed. This is what led the plaintiff to campaign against forced recruitment. He met with other young people belonging to the same church to denounce forced recruitment. [3]\nThe applicant claims to have, on December 14, 2008, organized a meeting with other young people in a bistro. When soldiers arrived, the plaintiff denounced the forced recruitment. He was arrested 11 days later and put in prison. He was released on January 1, 2009, and fled the same day from the DRC (first going to Rwanda, then to South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico before arriving in Canada). He arrived in Canada on April 26, 2009 and requested asylum upon his arrival. [4]\nIn the reasons for its decision of July 15, 2011, the Commission concluded that the applicant lacked credibility. The Commission argues that it did not believe that the applicant would have put himself and 15 other young people in danger by denouncing forced recruitment, in a public place, and in the presence of soldiers. The Commission recalled that, according to his testimony, the applicant had previously been afraid to speak out for fear of being arrested, or killed like his brother. [5]\nThe Commission argued that because it did not find the applicant's testimony credible, it gave no weight to the documentary evidence, in this case a letter from a priest who affirmed that the applicant was indeed in danger, as well as an arrest warrant for the applicant who was accused of insulting the government. The applicant therefore had his asylum application rejected.\nStandard of review and question to be decided [6]\nThe issue is whether the Commission's decision is reasonable:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nAnalysis [7]\nThe Commission's conclusions regarding the credibility of the applicant deserve deference and it is open to the Commission to conclude that the testimony is implausible to the extent that it bases this on reason and common sense:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (CAF). But the Court must intervene when the Commission concludes that testimony is implausible based on conclusions that cannot reasonably be drawn from the evidence that has been produced. In this case, the Commission's unfavorable decision is based on the sole implausibility that it was able to identify. Such a conclusion is arbitrary and does not take into account the evidence produced before the Commission. The decision must therefore be annulled. [8]\nThe Commission clearly found it implausible that the applicant, an intelligent and educated young man, aware of the risks to which he exposed himself by denouncing forced recruitment, nevertheless decided to speak in public, in the presence of soldiers, thereby putting himself and his young comrades in danger. This in no way allows us to conclude that such behavior is implausible. Most asylum seekers who cite fear of persecution for their political opinions have denounced a brutal regime, while being aware of the risks to which this exposed them. The authenticity of a political belief is not measured by the intelligence of the applicant, or his studies; any more than it can be assessed with regard to a vague criterion of rationality. History, including recent news, clearly shows that, viewed from a rational point of view, the most courageous political opposition can appear reckless. As Justice James Hugessen said, in the judgment\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> The argument that an action is implausible simply because it may prove dangerous for the person who commits it out of political commitment has never been particularly convincing [\nsic\n]. [9]\nAt the hearing, the Commission asked the applicant to explain why he had made comments to this effect, knowing that he was putting himself in danger. Here is the response given by the applicant, as it appears in the transcript of the hearing proceedings (certified court record, at paragraph 125):\nI managed to carry out this act because, well, I was already at the end of my rope or else the ideas were swirling around inside me. So I arrived to thwart this action so that we could not proceed with the recruitment of young people. Because I had not accepted seeing these young people die while I was alive and I could see it, witnessing the death of these young people. [10]\nThe Commission did not take into account the explanation given by the applicant. She only found it improbable that he would put himself and other young people in danger. However, as the applicant explained, they were all already in danger since they risked being recruited by force. This is what led the plaintiff to speak out. [11]\nThe Commission further ignored the fact that the applicant's testimony was corroborated by a warrant for his arrest for insulting the government; the Commission only said that it gave no weight to this document since the applicant did not appear credible. However, with regard to the credibility of the testimony given by the applicant, the mandate in question was of great relevance. The Commission cannot question the credibility of a testimony without taking into account the corroborating evidence, and then dismiss the evidence produced by the applicant, based on the conclusion it reached regarding its credibility. [12]\nThe application for judicial review is granted.\nJUDGMENT [13]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that the\napplication for judicial review is granted. The matter is referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board for reconsideration by another member of the Refugee Protection Division. No questions for certification have been proposed and the Court finds that none arise.\n[End of document]",

      "The court emphasized that the genuineness of political conviction isn’t assessed by rationality or intelligence, and that courageous dissent can appear 'foolhardy' when viewed rationally, citing precedent.",
      "The court highlighted that the Board failed to consider the applicant’s explanation for his actions – that he was driven to speak out by the imminent danger of forced recruitment – and instead simply reiterated its implausibility finding.",
      "The court criticized the Board for disregarding corroborating evidence, specifically an arrest warrant for 'insulting the government,' which supported the applicant’s claim, and for rejecting this evidence *because* it had already found the applicant not credible, creating a circular reasoning problem.",
      "The court determined the Board’s sole basis for its negative decision – the implausibility finding – was 'perverse' and 'made without regard to the evidence,' necessitating setting aside the decision and referring the matter back to the Board for reconsideration by a different member."
