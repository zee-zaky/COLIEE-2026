    "[1]\nCampbell, J.\n: In the present case, the Applicant is a citizen of Columbia who claims refugee protection on the basis that he was threatened by paramilitaries. The issue for determination is whether there was a breach of due process in the production of his evidence before the Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\"). For the reasons which follow, I find that there was.",
    "[2]\nThere is an obvious discrepancy between the Applicant's statement of events in his PIF, and the statement of events in his supporting witness' solicited affidavit. On this discrepancy, the RPD would be entitled to find that there is insufficient evidence upon which to make a positive refugee protection determination. In the present case, the RPD went further and found that the Applicant's claim is based on a concoction.",
    "[3]\nHowever, on the evidence in this case, the variance between the statements could be viewed as some evidence of lack of concoction. That is, the fact that the statements were in variance could be viewed as a signal that the Applicant, and his witness, did not enter into a plan to mislead. In such a case, I find that caution should be taken before jumping to conclusions. On the record, it appears that the RPD did not approach the evidence with caution.",
    "[4]\nAs argued by Counsel for the Applicant in the present application, a serious due process issue exists as to whether there was a fair hearing before the RPD. At the hearing, the Applicant was not allowed to lead his evidence, but instead, the Refugee Protection Officer was instructed to question first, and then, the RPD followed with what I find is accurately described by Counsel for the Applicant as \"badgering\" cross-examination.",
    "[5]\nCounsel for the Respondent relies on the consent of the lawyer acting on behalf of the Applicant at the hearing to legitimize the procedure which took place. Having perused the entire transcript of the hearing, I put no weight on the consent. It is quite clear that at the opening of the hearing the RPD had a suspicion that the Applicant's credibility was seriously in question, given the variance between the two statements which were in the written record. Immediately prior to asking for the Applicant's lawyer to consent to the procedure whereby the RPO would lead the claimant's case, the case was simply called \"a simple outlined claim\". As it turns out, it was anything but.",
    "[6]\nIn my opinion, before an Applicant's lawyer's consent to an unusual procedure can be given weight, full knowledge of the procedure to be adopted must first be conveyed. In the present case, there is no way that the Applicant's lawyer would have known the nature and intensity of the questioning to come. As the procedure adopted in the present case was highly unusual, I find it was incumbent on the RPD to state a reason for why the procedure was adopted before proceeding. No such reason was given. As a result, I can well understand why Counsel for the Applicant in the present review would argue that the RPD approached the case without an open mind.",
    "[7]\nIn my opinion, the conduct of the hearing was unfair, and, thus, I find that the decision was rendered in reviewable error.\nORDER",
    "[8]\nAccordingly, I set aside the RPD's decision and refer the matter back to a differently constituted Panel for redetermination.\n[End of document]"
