    "[1]\nPelletier, J.\n: Zinaida Mindich, an Israeli citizen born in the Ukraine, became a landed immigrant on June 29, 1994. On July 3, 1997 she applied for citizenship. The Citizenship Judge was satisfied that she met the criteria for citizenship but the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was not.",
    "[2]\nThe facts are relatively straightforward. In 1989, 1991, and 1992 Mrs. Mindich came to Canada as a visitor to visit her son and her grandchildren. In 1994 she came as a landed immigrant. When landing in Canada she lives in rented accommodation in Toronto which she maintains while she is away. She maintains a bank account which shows a pattern of deposits sufficient to pay her rent but little other activity. She has filed an Income tax return for the 1997 taxation year in which her only income was her foreign pension income. She has a Social Insurance number and a health services card. She has a son and grandchildren in Canada.",
    "[3]\nUnfortunately, Mrs. Mindich's husband has been very ill and receiving treatment in Israel. this is confirmed in a letter which indicates that he was hospitalized during the months of March and April 1997 due to complications in his cancer treatment and a number of small strokes.",
    "[4]\nOn her residence questionnaire, Mrs. Mindich declares the following periods of presence in Canada:\nJune 19, 1994 to\nDecember 29, 1994183 days\nJune 7, 1995 to\nDecember 7, 1995183 days\nMay 1, 1996 to\nOctober 31, 1996183 days\nApril 20, 1997\nto March 8, 1998321 days\nFor purposes of the residency calculations, the relevant breakdown would be:\nDate of Application:July 3, 1997\nStart date:July 3, 1993\nPresent in Canada\nJuly 3, 1993 to\nJuly 2, 1994 -0 days\nPresent in Canada\nJuly 3, 1994 to\nJuly 2, 1995 -206 days\nPresent in Canada\nJuly 3, 1995 to\nJuly 2, 1996 -219 days\nPresent in Canada\nJuly 3, 1996 to\nJuly 2, 1997 -\n193 days\nPresent in Canada\nJuly 3, 1994 to\nJuly 3, 1997 =618 days",
    "[5]\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appeals the decision of the Citizenship Judge that Mrs. Mindich has met the residency requirements of the\nAct\n. The Minister's position is that Mrs. Mindich has not established residency in Canada and, if she has, she has not been physically present in the country for the period prescribed by the\nAct\n.",
    "[6]\nThe part of the\nAct\nwhich applies to this dispute is s. 5:\n\"5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n(a) makes application for citizenship;\n(b) is eighteen years of age or over;\n(c) has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence, has not ceased since such admission to be a permanent resident pursuant to section 24 of the Immigration Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and\n(f) is not under a deportation order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor-in-Council made pursuant to section 20.\"\n\"5(1) The Minister grants citizenship to any person who:\n(a) requests it;\n(b) is at least eighteen years old;\n(c) was lawfully admitted to Canada as a permanent resident, has not since lost that title under section 24 of the Immigration Act, and has, in the four years preceding the date of his application, resided in Canada for at least three years in total, the duration of his residence being calculated as follows:\n(i) half a day for each day of residence in Canada before admission as a permanent resident,\n(ii) one day for each day of residence in Canada after admission as a permanent resident;\n(d) has sufficient knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has sufficient knowledge of Canada and the responsibilities and benefits conferred by citizenship;\n(f) is not subject to a deportation order and is not the subject of a declaration of the Governor in Council made under section 20.\"",
    "[7]\nWhile this comes before this court as an appeal from the decision of the Citizenship Judge, it is not necessarily a case where the court can simply substitute its opinion for that of the Citizenship Judge. As was pointed out by my brother Lutfy, J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 177 (T.D.), the Citizenship Court is a specialized tribunal and its decisions ought to be accorded a certain deference given the special expertise of the Citizenship Court in its subject matter. This is reflected in the comments of Teitelbaum, J., in\nKerho, Re\n(1988), 21 F.T.R. 180 (T.D.), at p. 184:\n\"... although the appeal is effectively a trial de novo, it is incumbent upon the appellant to show that the Citizenship Judge exercised her discretion on a wrong principle, or on a complete misapprehension of the facts or for some other compelling reason requiring my interference in her decision.\"\nTeitelbaum, J., made his comments at a time when citizenship appeals were by trial de novo. His remarks are all the more apt in the context of an appeal on the record.",
    "[8]\nThe particular issue which has given rise to conflicting opinions in this court is the construction of the residency requirements. Should the requirement that the applicant have accumulated three years of residence in Canada in the four years immediately preceding his application be construed as requiring:\n1. that the applicant has been physically present in Canada for at least 1095 days in the four years immediately preceding his/her application (\nHarry, Re\n, [1998] F.C.J. No. 189; 144 F.T.R. 141 (T.D.)); or\n2. that the applicant must have centralised his mode of living in Canada for at least three years prior to his application, notwithstanding that he may have been out of the country for more than one year in the immediately preceding four years?\nPapadogiorgakis, Re\n, [1978] 2 F.C. 208 (T.D.).\nJudges of this court have chosen to adopt one or the other of these positions, according to their best judgment. Judges of the Citizenship Court, on the other hand, have generally tended to adopt the less restrictive view in\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n, supra. In those cases where the Minister appeals the decision of the Citizenship judge on the issue of the residence, the outcome may well depend upon which of these two approaches the judge hearing the matter has adopted.",
    "[9]\nLutfy, J., has redefined the issue as one of standard of review as opposed to the correctness of one position or the other. Given the divergence in the views of the members of the Federal Court, a Citizenship Judge could choose one approach or the other and not be wrong on that count alone. The function of the judge sitting in appeal is to verify that the Citizenship Judge has properly applied the test of his or her choosing. I believe that this approach properly characterizes the issue, and I adopt it as my own.",
    "[10]\nIn his decision the Citizenship Judge gave the following reasons:\n\"The appellant is 476 days short of the required 1095. The reason for her absence is to visit her husband who is ill (see attached documents). This man is her second husband - he is not applying for citizenship. Her only family is the son in Toronto who cares for her and a daughter in New York. She received Returning Resident Permit during absence. It appears that her only home is with her son in Toronto. Her 2nd husband who is being looked after by\nhis\nfamily lives in Israel. She meets residence requirements as per Thurlow.\"",
    "[11]\nIn her application for citizenship, Mrs. Mindich indicated that the reason for her absences from Canada over the winters of 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 was to visit her children in Israel. In her residence questionnaire, Mrs. Mindich indicated that \"... the only reason I go to Israel is because my husband is ill and in hospital in Israel and I am unable to move him\". There is an inconsistency as to the reason for Mrs. Mindich's absences from Canada.",
    "[12]\nMrs. Mindich also notes in her residence questionnaire that \"my son and grandchildren are the only family I have except for my sick husband.\" This is at odds with the Citizenship Judge's comments about a daughter in New York, as well as the declaration that she was absent from the country to visit her children in Israel.",
    "[13]\nThe Citizenship Judge did not address his mind to the nature and quality of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada, focusing solely on the family relationship in respect of which there is, at a minimum, some ambiguity. The evidence in support of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada appears to consist entirely of relatively passive elements. She has maintained an apartment since May 1, 1996. Her previous residence, which she describes as having rented, was at 5 Fisherville #1004, Toronto, Ontario. On her Record of Landing, Mrs. Mindich gave the name of her son as the person willing to assist her in Canada. The son's address is 5 Fisherville Street #1004, Willowdale, Ontario. This may indicate that she has only had her own address in Canada for slightly more than a year in the four years preceding her application.",
    "[14]\nMrs. Mindich has a bank account whose activity appears to reflect few transactions other than paying the rent. She has a health services card and a social insurance number. There is no indication that she owns any property in Canada. Her source of income is a pension which presumably originates outside Canada.",
    "[15]\nTaken together, this evidence falls short of establishing the kind of connection with Canada contemplated by Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was) in\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n. It is more consistent with Mrs. Mindich acquiring a \"pied-à-terre\" in Canada to facilitate visiting her son while maintaining her former life in Israel. I find in the record little evidence capable of supporting a conclusion that Mrs. Mindich has centralized her mode of life in Canada for three years preceding her application for citizenship. While the Citizenship Judge is entitled to some deference in his assessment of the quality of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada, I must, with respect, disagree with his conclusion. I therefore allow the Minister's appeal.",
    "[16]\nIn closing, I note for the record that Mrs. Mindich was not present for the hearing of the appeal. The Affidavit of Service of the Notice of Application does not establish that Mrs. Mindich was personally served with the Notice of Application. However, she subsequently filed a Notice of Appearance indicating her intention to oppose the application. Pursuant to rule 147, I am prepared to validate service on the ground that the filing of the Notice of Appearance is evidence that the Notice of Application came to Mrs. Mindich's attention. Mrs. Mindich was advised of the date of the hearing by the Registry by ordinary mail. Counsel for the Minister advised the court that her office had received a call from someone on behalf of Mrs. Mindich indicating that she was concerned about the appeal and did not know what to do. She was apparently advised to contact the Federal Court for more information. There is no indication in the file of any contact being made with the court.",
    "[17]\nThere may be circumstances in which the court would not allow an applicant his/her remedy when entitlement had been established because the respondent, though having notice of the proceedings, did not attend. This is not one of those cases, primarily because Mrs. Mindich is free to bring another application for citizenship at any time. This decision does not foreclose Mrs. Mindich's rights beyond the present application.\nAppeal allowed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/clh\n[End of document]"

Judges of the Citizenship Court, on the other hand, have generally tended to adopt the less restrictive view in\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n, supra. In those cases where the Minister appeals the decision of the Citizenship judge on the issue of the residence, the outcome may well depend upon which of these two approaches the judge hearing the matter has adopted.\n\n[9]\nLutfy, J., has redefined the issue as one of standard of review as opposed to the correctness of one position or the other. Given the divergence in the views of the members of the Federal Court, a Citizenship Judge could choose one approach or the other and not be wrong on that count alone. The function of the judge sitting in appeal is to verify that the Citizenship Judge has properly applied the test of his or her choosing. I believe that this approach properly characterizes the issue, and I adopt it as my own.\n\n[10]\nIn his decision the Citizenship Judge gave the following reasons:\n\"The appellant is 476 days short of the required 1095. The reason for her absence is to visit her husband who is ill (see attached documents). This man is her second husband - he is not applying for citizenship. Her only family is the son in Toronto who cares for her and a daughter in New York. She received Returning Resident Permit during absence. It appears that her only home is with her son in Toronto. Her 2nd husband who is being looked after by\nhis\nfamily lives in Israel. She meets residence requirements as per Thurlow.\"\n\n[11]\nIn her application for citizenship, Mrs. Mindich indicated that the reason for her absences from Canada over the winters of 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 was to visit her children in Israel. In her residence questionnaire, Mrs. Mindich indicated that \"... the only reason I go to Israel is because my husband is ill and in hospital in Israel and I am unable to move him\". There is an inconsistency as to the reason for Mrs. Mindich's absences from Canada.\n\n[12]\nMrs. Mindich also notes in her residence questionnaire that \"my son and grandchildren are the only family I have except for my sick husband.\" This is at odds with the Citizenship Judge's comments about a daughter in New York, as well as the declaration that she was absent from the country to visit her children in Israel.\n\n[13]\nThe Citizenship Judge did not address his mind to the nature and quality of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada, focusing solely on the family relationship in respect of which there is, at a minimum, some ambiguity. The evidence in support of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada appears to consist entirely of relatively passive elements. She has maintained an apartment since May 1, 1996. Her previous residence, which she describes as having rented, was at 5 Fisherville #1004, Toronto, Ontario. On her Record of Landing, Mrs. Mindich gave the name of her son as the person willing to assist her in Canada. The son's address is 5 Fisherville Street #1004, Willowdale, Ontario. This may indicate that she has only had her own address in Canada for slightly more than a year in the four years preceding her application.\n\n[14]\nMrs. Mindich has a bank account whose activity appears to reflect few transactions other than paying the rent. She has a health services card and a social insurance number. There is no indication that she owns any property in Canada. Her source of income is a pension which presumably originates outside Canada.\n\n[15]\nTaken together, this evidence falls short of establishing the kind of connection with Canada contemplated by Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was) in\nRe Papadogiorgakis\n. It is more consistent with Mrs. Mindich acquiring a \"pied-à-terre\" in Canada to facilitate visiting her son while maintaining her former life in Israel. I find in the record little evidence capable of supporting a conclusion that Mrs. Mindich has centralized her mode of life in Canada for three years preceding her application for citizenship. While the Citizenship Judge is entitled to some deference in his assessment of the quality of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada, I must, with respect, disagree with his conclusion. I therefore allow the Minister's appeal.\n\n[16]\nIn closing, I note for the record that Mrs. Mindich was not present for the hearing of the appeal. The Affidavit of Service of the Notice of Application does not establish that Mrs. Mindich was personally served with the Notice of Application. However, she subsequently filed a Notice of Appearance indicating her intention to oppose the application. Pursuant to rule 147, I am prepared to validate service on the ground that the filing of the Notice of Appearance is evidence that the Notice of Application came to Mrs. Mindich's attention. Mrs. Mindich was advised of the date of the hearing by the Registry by ordinary mail. Counsel for the Minister advised the court that her office had received a call from someone on behalf of Mrs. Mindich indicating that she was concerned about the appeal and did not know what to do. She was apparently advised to contact the Federal Court for more information. There is no indication in the file of any contact being made with the court.\n\n[17]\nThere may be circumstances in which the court would not allow an applicant his/her remedy when entitlement had been established because the respondent, though having notice of the proceedings, did not attend. This is not one of those cases, primarily because Mrs. Mindich is free to bring another application for citizenship at any time. This decision does not foreclose Mrs. Mindich's rights beyond the present application.\nAppeal allowed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/clh\n[End of document]",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court acknowledged the differing interpretations of the residency requirement in Section 5 of the Citizenship Act – whether it necessitates 1095 days of physical presence or a 'centralization of life' in Canada for three years – and adopted an approach of reviewing whether the Citizenship Judge properly applied *either* test, rather than substituting its own judgment.",
      "The court found the Citizenship Judge erred by focusing almost exclusively on the applicant’s family ties and the reason for her absences (caring for her ill husband) without adequately assessing the *quality* and *nature* of her attachment to Canada.",
      "The court determined that the evidence presented – a rented apartment, minimal bank account activity beyond rent payments, a health card, a social insurance number, and foreign pension income – was insufficient to demonstrate the kind of connection to Canada contemplated in *Re Papadogiorgakis*, which requires more than simply maintaining a 'pied-à-terre'.",
      "The court concluded that the evidence was more consistent with the applicant maintaining her primary life in Israel while visiting her son in Canada, and therefore she had not centralized her mode of life in Canada for the required three years.",
      "Despite inconsistencies in the applicant’s stated reasons for absences (visiting children versus a sick husband), the court’s decision rested primarily on the overall lack of evidence demonstrating a substantial connection to Canada, not solely on the conflicting statements.",
      "The court validated service of the appeal despite potential deficiencies in the Affidavit of Service, based on the applicant’s filing of a Notice of Appearance, and noted the applicant’s failure to contact the court for assistance despite being advised of the hearing."
