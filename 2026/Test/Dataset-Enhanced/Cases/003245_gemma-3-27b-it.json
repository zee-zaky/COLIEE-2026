    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nPinard, J.\nMay 5, 2011.\nCounsel:\nSawsan A. Habbal, for the applicant;\nBanafsheh Sokhansanj, for the respondents.\nSolicitors of Record:\nSawsan A. Habbal, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondents.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nPinard, J.\n: This is a motion on behalf of the applicant for a stay of execution of a valid deportation order against him pending disposition of his application for leave and for judicial review of his third Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (\"PRRA\"), dated March 29, 2011. The deportation is scheduled for May 5, 2011, in the evening.",
    "[2]\nThe arguments of the applicant with respect to whether there is a serious issue in this matter deal basically with the reasonableness of the impugned decision. At this stage, I have serious doubts as to the existence of any valid reason to substitute my own appreciation of the facts to that made by the PRRA officer. In any event, without deciding whether there is a serious question to be determined by the Court, the requested stay is denied on the grounds that the applicant has failed to establish that he will suffer irreparable harm if he is removed to Lebanon, and to show that the balance of convenience is in his favour (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[3]\nWith respect to the question of irreparable harm, the applicant's submission that his outstanding second Humanitarian and Compassionate (\"H&C\") application, filed just two weeks ago and based primarily on his establishment in Canada, will be rendered moot should he be removed from Canada, is without merit. It is trite law that neither an H&C application nor a judicial review application is rendered moot by the mere fact that a person has been deported (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[4]\nIn fact, the applicant has had a previous H&C application which examined his establishment in Canada and which was refused. He has also had the benefit of a spousal sponsorship application with his then spouse which also was refused, in that case for lack of\nbona fides\n.",
    "[5]\nConcerning the allegation of harm to the applicant's companion and her children, as well as the contractors paid by the applicant, the Supreme Court of Canada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  MacDonald Inc\n, supra, at para 58, has held that harm to a third party, as opposed to the applicant, does not meet the \"irreparable\" threshold for the purposes of a stay motion (see also\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[6]\nFurthermore, irreparable harm must be something more than the inherent consequences of deportation.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 21, Mr. Justice Denis Pelletier stated:\n. . . if the phrase \"irreparable harm\" is to retain any meaning at all, it must refer to some prejudice beyond that which is inherent in the notion of deportation itself. To be deported is to lose your job, to be separated from familiar faces and places. It is accompanied by enforced separation and heartbreak. . . .",
    "[7]\nThe applicant's argument that the loss of his business will cause irreparable harm is also without merit. As held by this Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Canada does not equate to irreparable harm.",
    "[8]\nFinally, there is no new evidence before me to demonstrate that the applicant, who has benefitted from an assessment of his refugee claim, three risk assessments and reviews by this Court, faces a risk to his life if he is removed. In the circumstances, the balance of convenience lies with the respondent, as section 48 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27, provides that an enforceable removal order must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.\nORDER",
    "[9]\nFor the above mentioned reasons, the applicant's motion for an order staying the execution of the deportation order against him is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

      "The court clarified that ‘irreparable harm’ must be more than the inherent consequences of deportation itself – such as job loss and separation from family and community – and referenced prior case law defining this standard.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the loss of the applicant’s business constituted irreparable harm, citing a previous decision of the same court.",
      "The court determined there was no new evidence presented to suggest the applicant faced a risk to his life upon removal to Lebanon, noting he had already undergone multiple assessments of his claims.",
      "The court emphasized the statutory obligation under section 48 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to enforce removal orders ‘as soon as is reasonably practicable’, finding this supported the balance of convenience favouring the respondent."
