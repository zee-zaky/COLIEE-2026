    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC)\nMLB unedited judgment\nMerck Frosst Canada & Co. (applicant) and The Minister of Health Canada (respondent)\nIndexed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )\nCounsel:\nKarine Joizil, for the applicant;\nMarie Crowley, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nFasken, Martineau, DuMoulin LLP, Montréal, Québec, for the applicant;\nMorris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.",
    "[1]\nPinard, J.\n: This is an appeal from the decision of Prothonotary Tabib sustaining the respondent's objections to the applicant's questions during the cross-examination on affidavit of the respondent's witnesses Margery Carole Snider and Serge Durand. The questions at issue concern the process followed by the respondent in reaching his decision dated December 19, 2001, to partially disclose certain records under section 28 of the Access to Information Act (the \"ATIA\"). The respondent's decision is the subject-matter of the within application for review pursuant to section 44 of the ATIA.",
    "[2]\nThe respondent objected to the questions on the ground that they are irrelevant. Prothonotary Tabib agreed with the respondent's position and stated the following in her decision:\nAll the other objections relate to the decisional process followed by the respondent and the material considered by the affiants in arriving at their decisions or recommendations. Whether the principles to be applied by this Court on an application pursuant to section 44 of the Access to Information Act is a determination de novo, as propounded by the respondent or a review based on the standard of correctness as suggested by the applicant, the issue of how and on the basis of what information the respondent arrived at its decision is not relevant to the determination of this application. As to the validity of the questions as a means of testing the witnesses' credibility, I find that the credibility of the affiants is not put in issue in these proceedings in such a way as to render relevant the questions objected to.",
    "[3]\nUpon hearing counsel for the parties and upon reading the material filed, I am not prepared to conduct a de novo review of the merits of the impugned decision and to exercise my own discretion differently because the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Prothonotary's decision is \"clearly wrong\", in that it was based upon an incorrect principle of law or a misapprehension of the facts, or that the question raised is vital to the \"final issue\" in the case (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] S.C.J. No. 23 (S.C.C.) (QL)). Indeed, I am of the opinion that the Prothonotary applied the correct legal principle of relevance in deciding that the respondent's objections should be sustained. In the underlying application for review pursuant to section 44 of the ATIA, the Court is not reviewing the legality of the respondent's decision, but will decide de novo, based in part on new evidence that was not before the respondent, whether the information contained in the records is of such a confidential or prejudicial nature that it should be exempt from disclosure under section 20 of the ATIA. Considering that the credibility of the affiants is not at issue, the questions related to the respondent's decision-making process are wholly irrelevant to the issues to be determined by the Court.",
    "[4]\nConsequently, the motion is dismissed, with costs.\n[End of document]"

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed the Prothonotary’s decision to sustain the respondent’s objections to questions regarding the decision-making process behind the partial disclosure of records under the Access to Information Act (ATIA).",
      "The court clarified that a review under section 44 of the ATIA does *not* involve reviewing the legality of the respondent’s original decision; instead, the court conducts a *de novo* review focused on whether the information *should* be exempt from disclosure under section 20 of the ATIA, considering new evidence not previously before the respondent.",
      "Because the review is *de novo* and considers new evidence, the court found the process by which the respondent initially reached its decision to be irrelevant to the current inquiry.",
      "The court specifically stated that the credibility of the affiants was not at issue in the proceedings, further supporting the finding that questions about the decision-making process lacked relevance.",
      "The court agreed with the Prothonotary’s application of the legal principle of relevance and found no error in the initial decision, stating the applicant failed to demonstrate the Prothonotary’s decision was “clearly wrong” based on incorrect law, misapprehension of facts, or a vital issue to the final determination."
