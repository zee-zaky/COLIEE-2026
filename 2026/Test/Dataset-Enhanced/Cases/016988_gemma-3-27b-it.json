    "[1]\nLemieux, J.\n: I find myself in substantial agreement with counsel for the respondent that this judicial review application must be dismissed.",
    "[2]\nThe applicants, a family unit composed of the parents and their two children who had emigrated to Israel from Russia in 1993, are at their second refugee claim seeking Canada's protection; their first claim was dismissed by the Refugee Division on November 19, 1999.",
    "[3]\nIn that first claim the applicants, who are of Russian nationality and non-Jewish, feared persecution from an ultranationalist Jewish group. A further fear was expressed by Vladimir who had requested an exemption from military service on the ground he objected carrying arms, but was denied.",
    "[4]\nAfter their first claim was refused the family did not challenge the decision and voluntarily left Canada going to Germany and staying there for a few weeks without making a refugee claim. The father, Alexander, and his daughter, Anna, tried to re-enter Canada but were immediately sent to Israel. The mother, Marina, and her son went to Mexico where they also did not make a refugee claim.",
    "[5]\nI endorse the following arguments advanced by counsel for the respondent:\n1. The tribunal properly applied the principle of\nres judicata\n(issue\nestoppel\n) to bar the claims of Marina and Vladimir Zilenko who did not return to  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );\nCounsel for the applicants argued\nres judicata\ndid not apply because there was no final decision in either the first or second claims. His submission cannot be accepted.\nThe principle of\nres judicata\napplies to the first claim and not the second claim and, in this case, the first refugee determination was a final decision because it was not challenged and the applicants voluntarily departed. I add that in both <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, the situation was identical: the claimants voluntarily departed without challenging the first decision.\n2. The tribunal did not limit the nature and scope of the applicants' fear of persecution to that related to compulsory service in Israel but rather considered their fear of becoming victims at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. The tribunal was not satisfied they were targeted personally or collectively as members of the non-Jewish, Russian community (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.));\nCounsel for the applicants argues the tribunal failed to consider the ground of Russian nationality and being non-Jewish at least for the father and his daughter who had returned to Israel. The problem counsel faces is that this ground was not advanced before the second tribunal.\n3. The issue of lack of state protection, by reason of the applicants' nationality and religion was not raised before the tribunal hearing their second claim - their fear and the evidence they gave was not that they would be denied state protection. There was no evidence before the tribunal on the point and I reject the suggestion of counsel for the applicants that lack of state protection can be inferred. Applicants must provide clear and convincing evidence (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 726).\n4. The failure to claim refugee status when the opportunity arose while not a determining factor here is an important one to consider in evaluating true subjective fear (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). This case was not one of delaying to make a claim as argued by counsel for the applicants.\n5. Lastly, counsel for the applicants quoted the following extract from Hathaway's\nThe Law of Refugee Status\n, at page 188:\nThus, while the general proposition is that the victims of war and violence are not by virtue of that fact alone refugees, it is nonetheless possible for persons coming from a strife-torn state to establish a claim to refugee status.\nThis is so where the violence is not simply generalized, but is rather directed toward a group defined by civil or political status; or, if the war or conflict is non-specific in impact, where the claimant's fear can be traced to specific forms of disfranchisement within the society or origin.\n[emphasis mine]\nCounsel for the applicants argued the applicants, because of their ethnicity and religion, would be less likely to receive effective state protection in Israel than Jewish citizens would. The applicants provided no personal or documentary evidence through country reports to back up that argument. As a result, I rejected it.\nORDER",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court agreed with the respondent that the judicial review application should be dismissed, finding substantial merit in the respondent’s arguments.",
      "The court upheld the application of *res judicata* to Marina and Vladimir Zilenko’s claims because they did not challenge the initial negative refugee determination and voluntarily left Canada. The court reasoned that this voluntary departure without appeal constituted a final decision, barring subsequent claims on the same grounds, consistent with precedent.",
      "The court found that the tribunal appropriately considered the applicants’ fear of persecution, including the possibility of violence from Palestinian terrorists, and was not limited to solely considering fears related to compulsory military service. The court determined the tribunal’s finding that the applicants weren’t personally or collectively targeted was reasonable.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the tribunal should have considered the lack of state protection based on the applicants’ nationality and religion, because this issue was not raised during the second claim hearing and no evidence was presented to support it. The court emphasized the requirement for ‘clear and convincing evidence’ to establish such a claim.",
      "The court considered the applicants’ failure to seek refugee status in Germany and Mexico as a factor in assessing the genuineness of their subjective fear, though not a determining one. It distinguished the case from one of simple delay, but still found the lack of claims relevant to evaluating the applicants’ fear.",
      "The court dismissed the argument that the applicants, as non-Jewish Russian citizens, would receive less state protection in Israel, finding it unsupported by any personal or documentary evidence. The court referenced Hathaway’s *The Law of Refugee Status* but ultimately rejected the argument due to the lack of supporting evidence."
