    "[1]\nMcGillis, J.\n: The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) has applied to be added as a party respondent in judicial review proceedings instituted by the Attorney General of Canada (Attorney General) challenging the decision of the Commission to extend the time period for considering the complaint of the respondent Mr. Bernard. The Attorney General has opposed the application of the Commission on the basis that the procedure prescribed by the\nFederal Court Rules\n(\nRules\n) does not permit the addition of the Commission as a party respondent in the judicial review of its own decision, but rather requires it to seek leave to intervene in the proceedings.",
    "[2]\nPart V.1 of the\nRules\nentitled \"Applications for Judicial Review\" contains a procedural code governing applications for judicial review made under ss. 18.1 and 28 of the\nFederal Court Act\n. These\nRules\nwere substantially amended in 1992, making earlier jurisprudence of limited, if any, assistance in determining the question raised on this motion.",
    "[3]\nUnder the\nRules\n, the originating notice of motion instituting the application for judicial review shall name as a respondent \"... any interested person who is adverse in interest to the applicant in the proceedings before the federal board, commission or other tribunal ...\". (See rule 1602(3).) An \"interested person\" is defined in rule 1600 as being \"... a person who was heard in the proceeding before the federal board, commission or other tribunal in respect of which the application for judicial review is made\". In applying these provisions, the Commission does not fall within the definition of an \"interested person\". Accordingly, the\nRules\ndo not contemplate its addition as a party respondent in the judicial review of its own application. However, in order to ensure that, in appropriate cases, a federal board, commission or other tribunal may participate in the hearing of the application for judicial review of its own decision, rule 1611 permits it to make an application to intervene in the proceedings. Rule 1611(1) provides as follows:\n\"Any person who wishes to intervene in the hearing of an application for judicial review,\nincluding the federal board, commission or other tribunal in respect of whose decision the application has been made\n, must file a notice of application for leave to intervene and serve a copy of it on all the parties.\" (Emphasis added)",
    "[4]\nI am therefore satisfied that the\nRules\npreclude the addition of the Commission as a party respondent in judicial review proceedings challenging its own decision and only permit its participation as an intervenor at the discretion of the court under rule 1611. It is noteworthy that the\nRules\nhave developed in a manner consistent with jurisprudence concerning the role of a board, tribunal or commission before a court of law. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 449; 89 D.L.R.(3d) 161.) I should also mention that, although my brother Teitelbaum, J., considered the role of the Commission before the court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), the status of the Commission as a party respondent was not challenged before him.",
    "[5]\nIn the case at bar, counsel for the Attorney General generously agreed to consent to an application by the Commission to intervene in the proceedings, including any reasonable terms concerning the filing of evidence or rights of appeal. However, counsel for the Commission declined the offer.",
    "[6]\nThe application by the Commission to be added as a party respondent is therefore dismissed without prejudice to its right to bring an application under rule 1611 to intervene in the judicial review proceedings.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Gary W. McLaughlin/sms\n[End of document]"

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court determined that the Federal Court Rules (specifically Part V.1) do not allow a federal board, commission, or tribunal – in this case, the Canadian Human Rights Commission – to be added as a party respondent when its own decision is under judicial review.",
      "The court based this conclusion on a close reading of Rules 1602(3) and 1600, finding that the Commission does not fit the definition of an “interested person” as required for respondent status; the definition requires having been 'heard' in the original proceeding, which is not the Commission's role.",
      "The court highlighted that Rule 1611 explicitly provides a separate mechanism for such bodies to participate – through an application for leave to intervene – and interpreted this as demonstrating the Rules’ intention to distinguish between respondent status and intervention.",
      "The court noted the Rules were substantially amended in 1992, rendering prior case law less relevant to the current interpretation.",
      "The court affirmed that this procedural framework aligns with established jurisprudence regarding the role of administrative bodies before the courts.",
      "The court dismissed the Commission’s application to be added as a party respondent but explicitly preserved its right to apply to intervene under Rule 1611."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application by the Commission to be added as a party respondent is dismissed without prejudice to its right to bring an application under rule 1611 to intervene in the judicial review proceedings."
