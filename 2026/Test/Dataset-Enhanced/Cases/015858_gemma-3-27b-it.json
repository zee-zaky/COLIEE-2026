    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  J.\nDecember 2, 2004.\nCounsel:\nMansour Rasaei, appeared on his own behalf;\nJonathan Shapiro, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nMorris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.",
    "[1]\nSnider, J.\n: Mr. Mansour Rasaei, originally a citizen of Iran but working and living as a permanent resident in Singapore immediately prior to his arrival in Canada, was approved as a permanent Canadian resident on August 1, 2000, and landed in Canada on September 6, 2000.",
    "[2]\nOn October 6, 2003, Mr. Rasaei applied for Canadian citizenship. Despite passing the requisite citizenship test, Mr. Rasaei was denied Canadian citizenship on May 4, 2004, following his hearing before a Citizenship Judge, on the grounds that he did not meet the residency requirements set out in s. 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, as amended (the \"Act\"). Mr. Rasaei appeals this decision pursuant to s. 14(5) of the Act. More specifically, Mr. Rasaei seeks an Order that the Citizenship Judge's decision be set aside and that this Court render a decision approving his application for Canadian citizenship.\nISSUES",
    "[3]\nMr. Rasaei raises the following three issues:\n1. The Citizenship Judge failed to properly interpret the residency test and thereby misinterpreted s. 5(1)(c) of the Act;\n2. The Citizenship Judge erred in not making a recommendation to the Minister pursuant to subsections 5(3) and (4) of the Act; and,\n3. The Citizenship Judge ignored relevant evidence submitted by Mr. Rasaei to establish that he was regularly, normally and customarily living in Canada.\nANALYSIS\nStandard of Review",
    "[4]\nTraditionally, decisions of a Citizenship Judge had been subject to review according to a standard of correctness ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 7 (T.D.)). However, in a more recent decision of the Federal Court (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 6, 7), Justice Tremblay-Lamer has suggested that the reasonableness simpliciter standard is more appropriate since the question of whether a person has met the residency requirement under the Act is a question of mixed fact and law, and that Citizenship Judges are owed some deference by virtue of their special degree of knowledge and experience. I accept this as an appropriate standard of review. Accordingly, as long as there is a demonstrated understanding of the case law and appreciation of the facts and their application to the statutory test, deference should be shown.\nIssue 1: Did the Citizenship Judge fail to properly interpret the residency test and thereby misinterpreted s. 5(1)(c) of the Act?",
    "[5]\nMr. Rasaei submits that the intention to maintain Canada as one's country of residence is important but not determinative. He asserts that, where a person has been physically absent from Canada, the time absent may count toward residency regardless as long as he or she has first established residence in Canada before the absence and has continued his or her residence in Canada while he or she is abroad (Re: Papadogiorgakis [1978] 2 F.C. 208 (F.C.T.D.), 88 D.L.R. (3d) 243,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and Re: Sun (1992), 58 F.T.R. 264 (F.C.T.D.)).",
    "[6]\nMr. Rasaei also notes that the Federal Court has previously indicated that an actual presence in Canada throughout the specified statutory period is not a prerequisite to meeting the residence requirement (Re: Banerjee, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1360).",
    "[7]\nMr. Rasaei submits that the Citizenship Judge erred in simply counting the days he was absent, rather than inquiring into the reasons why he was absent. Had such a purposive investigation been undertaken, Mr. Rasaei is of the opinion that the period during which he was absent (for about 521 days through all of 2002 and parts of 2001 and 2003) would not have counted against him in its entirety.",
    "[8]\nParagraph 5(1)(c) of the Act sets out three criteria that an applicant for citizenship must satisfy. These are:\n(a) lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence;\n(b) retention of permanent residence status; and,\n(c) the accumulation of at least three years' residence in Canada within a four year period immediately preceding the date of the application, as calculated under the prescribed formula set out under the paragraph.",
    "[9]\nAll applicants for citizenship must satisfy the three criteria set out in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act. Only the third criterion is in issue in this case.",
    "[10]\nIn assessing Mr. Rasaei's application, the Citizenship Judge relied on the decision of Re: Koo [1993] 1 F.C. 186, (1992), 19 Imm. L.R. (2d) 1 (T.D.). In that case, Justice Reed formulated six factors to assist in determining whether Canada is the country where an applicant for citizenship \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" or whether Canada is the country in which the applicant has \"centralized his or her mode of existence\". The six factors to be addressed are as follows:\n(1) was the individual physically present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences which occurred immediately before the application for citizenship?\n(2) where are the Applicant's immediate family and dependents (and extended family) resident?\n(3) does the pattern of physical presence in Canada indicate a returning home or merely visiting the country?\n(4) what is the extent of the physical absences? If an Applicant is only a few days short of the 1,095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence than if those absences are extensive.\n(5) is the physical absence caused by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, accompanying a spouse who has accepted employment abroad?\n(6) what is the quality of the connection with Canada: is it more substantial than that which exists with any other country?",
    "[11]\nIn this case, I am satisfied that the six Koo factors were assessed with due regard to the evidence before him. The Judge provided a detailed refusal letter that surveyed the entirety of Mr. Rasaei's application for Canadian citizenship, as it pertained to the issue of residency. In addition to the shortfall of 508 days, he noted Mr. Rasaei's indicia of residence in Canada, the nature of his employment in the United States, the existence of family in Iran and the severing of ties with Singapore. In short, based on the evidence before him, the Citizenship Judge provided an accurate application of the evidence to the factors in determining residency. His conclusion that Mr. Rasaei had not centralized his life in Canada is not unreasonable.",
    "[12]\nMr. Rasaei would have this Court re-weigh the evidence to come to a different conclusion; that is not the role of the Court.\nIssue 2: Did the Citizenship Judge err in not making a recommendation to the Minister pursuant to subsections 5(3) and (4) of the Act?",
    "[13]\nMr. Rasaei submits that he has faced great difficulty as a landed immigrant in finding employment in his chosen profession in Canada. This inability to procure employment is the main reason why he had to live outside Canada for a lengthy period (and, indeed, seems to continue to have to do so upon occasion). Despite this explanation, the Citizenship Judge did not consider the hardship created by the lack of Canadian citizenship as a reasonable cause to exercise discretion and recommend to the Minister that Mr. Rasaei be granted Canadian citizenship despite his non-fulfilment of the residency requirement.",
    "[14]\nThis issue is truly a sub-issue of the first issue. The necessary analysis in determining whether a recommendation should be made to grant citizenship despite failure to meet the residency requirements is essentially the same as that made when determining if the residency requirements should be waived. Mr. Rasaei must show a substantial connection to Canada. Failing that, compelling reasons to waive the residency requirements should be shown. These must be based on compassionate grounds or the undue hardship that someone would suffer should their citizenship be denied.",
    "[15]\nIn his decision, the Citizenship Judge noted that no material was filed in support of a recommendation under subsections 5(3) and (4) of the Act, but that, after careful consideration of all the circumstances of Mr. Rasaei's case, he was not of the opinion that Mr. Rasaei's case warranted a favourable recommendation \"since there was no evidence of any health disability, any special or unusual hardship or services of an exceptional value to Canada\".",
    "[16]\nI see no error in his decision in this regard.\nIssue 3: Did the Citizenship Judge ignore relevant evidence submitted by Mr. Rasaei to establish that he was regularly, normally and customarily living in Canada?",
    "[17]\nMr. Rasaei claims that the Citizenship Judge erred because he did not factor in Mr. Rasaei's Returning Resident Permit when determining the total days of residency in Canada. Mr. Rasaei states that his absence from Canada was clearly caused by a temporary situation, since he had been unable to find work in Canada in his chosen profession (engineering). Upon being hired by Baker Hughes Inc. in Massachusetts (which, the Applicant notes, is a multinational corporation which has more than 50 locations throughout Canada, inter alia), he clearly indicated his desire to return to Canada to make his home since he informed Citizenship and Immigration Canada about his temporary absence from Canada and obtained a Returning Resident Permit. Mr. Rasaei asserts that the Citizenship Judge should have taken this permit into consideration.",
    "[18]\nA tribunal-or, as here, a Citizenship Judge-need not mention each and every document considered in reaching his decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). Failure to mention a document is not fatal to a decision, provided that the reasons for the decision are reasonably based on the \"totality of the evidence adduced\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 318).",
    "[19]\nIn this case, I am satisfied that this particular evidence, which has little if any relevance to the test for citizenship, was not ignored. At most, the Returning Resident Permit is an indication of Mr. Rasei's intention to make Canada his home. The Judge acknowledged Mr. Rasei's intentions when he stated that \"your goal is to remain in Canada and you are looking forward to finding fulltime employment in Canada\". Unfortunately for Mr. Rasaei, good intentions do not replace physical presence and other factors in the Koo analysis.",
    "[20]\nI have no doubt that Mr. Rasaei will, in time, become a valuable citizen of our country. However, he must first satisfy the requirements of the Citizenship Act.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[21]\nFor these reasons, I conclude that the Citizenship Judge made no error that warrants intervention by this Court and that Mr. Rasaei's appeal should not succeed.\nORDER",
    "[22]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\nThe Appellant's appeal is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

However, he must first satisfy the requirements of the Citizenship Act.\nCONCLUSION\n\n[21]\nFor these reasons, I conclude that the Citizenship Judge made no error that warrants intervention by this Court and that Mr. Rasaei's appeal should not succeed.\nORDER\n\n[22]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\nThe Appellant's appeal is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

      "The citizenship application was denied in May 2004 by a Citizenship Judge due to failure to meet residency requirements.",
      "The applicant passed the required citizenship test.",
      "The applicant experienced a period of approximately 521 days of absence from Canada between 2001 and 2003.",
      "The applicant sought employment in Canada but experienced difficulty finding work in their profession (engineering).",

      "Applicants": [
        "Intention to maintain Canada as country of residence is not determinative; physical absence can count towards residency if residence was established before absence and continued during absence.",
        "Actual physical presence throughout the statutory period is not a prerequisite for meeting the residency requirement.",
        "The Citizenship Judge erred in simply counting days absent without inquiring into the reasons for absence; a purposive investigation would have shown the absences shouldn't have counted against him entirely.",
        "The Citizenship Judge should have made a recommendation to the Minister under subsections 5(3) and (4) of the Act, given the difficulty finding employment in Canada and the resulting need to live abroad.",
        "The Citizenship Judge ignored the Returning Resident Permit, which demonstrated intent to return to Canada and that absence was temporary due to employment circumstances.",
        "Absence was due to a temporary situation (employment in the US) and he informed Citizenship and Immigration Canada of his temporary absence and obtained a Returning Resident Permit."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The Citizenship Judge properly applied the residency test and interpreted s. 5(1)(c) of the Act.",
        "The Citizenship Judge assessed the six Koo factors with due regard to the evidence.",
        "No material was filed in support of a recommendation under subsections 5(3) and (4) of the Act, and there was no evidence of health disability, hardship, or exceptional service to Canada.",
        "The Returning Resident Permit had little relevance to the citizenship test and was not ignored by the Judge; it only indicated intent, which is insufficient without physical presence and other factors."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court adopted a 'reasonableness simpliciter' standard of review, deferring to the Citizenship Judge's expertise in applying the statutory test to the facts, provided there was a demonstrated understanding of case law and appreciation of the facts.",
      "The central issue was whether the applicant met the residency requirement under s. 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act, requiring three years' residence within a four-year period. The court found the Judge correctly applied this requirement.",
      "The court acknowledged the applicant's argument that intention to maintain Canada as one's country of residence is important, but affirmed that physical presence and the 'Koo' factors are central to the analysis.",
      "The court explicitly endorsed the six factors outlined in *Re: Koo* (1993) as a framework for determining whether an applicant 'regularly, normally or customarily lives' in Canada, and found the Judge had appropriately considered these factors.",
      "The Judge’s conclusion that the applicant had not centralized his life in Canada was deemed reasonable based on the evidence, including the applicant’s employment outside Canada, family ties elsewhere, and the extent of his absences (508 days). The court refused to re-weigh the evidence.",
      "Regarding the potential for a recommendation to the Minister under s. 5(3) and (4) to waive the residency requirement, the court found no error in the Judge’s decision not to make one, as the applicant did not demonstrate substantial connection to Canada, undue hardship, or exceptional service to Canada.",
      "The court held that the Citizenship Judge was not required to explicitly mention every piece of evidence considered, and found that the Returning Resident Permit, while indicating intent, was not a determinative factor and was implicitly considered when the Judge acknowledged the applicant’s stated goal of returning to Canada.",
      "The court ultimately concluded that the Citizenship Judge did not err in denying citizenship and that the appeal should be dismissed, emphasizing that the applicant had not met the statutory requirements for citizenship."
