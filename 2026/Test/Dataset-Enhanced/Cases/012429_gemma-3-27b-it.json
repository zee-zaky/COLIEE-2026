    "[1]\nLagacé, D.J.\n[Translation]: The applicant is applying under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), for judicial review of the decision made on June 18, 2008 by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the panel), in which the panel made a deportation order against the applicant after determining that he had violated human or international rights, which made him inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA.\nII.\nRelevant legislation",
    "[2]\nSubsection 35(1)(\nhas\n) of the IRPA reads as follows:\nHuman or international rights violations\n35.\n(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for\n(\nhas\n) committing an act outside Canada that constitutes an offense referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n;\n.........................\nViolation of human or international rights\n35.\n(1) The following facts result in inadmissibility for violation of human or international rights:\n(a) commit, outside Canada, one of the offenses set out in sections 4 to 7 of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n;",
    "[3]\nThe panel found that the applicant had committed crimes against humanity outside Canada. Such crimes are provided for in paragraph 6(1)(\nb\n) of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n, S.C. 2000, c. 24 (CAHWCA), and are defined in subsection 6(3) of that Act. Those provisions read as follows:\nGenocide, etc., committed outside Canada\n6.\n(1) Every person who, either before or after the coming into force of this section, commits outside Canada\n...\n(\nb\n) a crime against humanity, or\n...\nDefinitions\n(3) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\"crime against humanity\"\ncrime against humanity \n\"crime against humanity\" means murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution or any other inhumane act or omission that is committed against any civilian population or any identifiable group and that, at the time and in the place of its commission, constitutes a crime against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by virtue of its being criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations, whether or not it constitutes a contravention of the law in force at the time and in the place of its commission.\n.........................\nGenocide, crime against humanity (CCH), etc., committed abroad\n6.\n(1) Every person who commits any of the following offenses abroad, before or after the coming into force of this section, is guilty of an indictable offense and may be prosecuted for that offense under section 8:\n[...]\n(b) crime against humanity;\n[...]\nDefinitions\n(3) The following definitions apply in this section.\ncrime against humanity\n\"\ncrime against humanity\n\"\ncrime against humanity Murder, extermination, reduction into slavery, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution or other act - act or omission - inhumane, on the one hand, committed against a civilian population or an identifiable group of persons and, on the other hand, which constitutes, at the time and place of the perpetration, a crime against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by reason of its criminal character according to the general principles of law recognized by all nations, whether or not it constitutes a transgression of the law in force at that time and place.\nIII.\nSummary of the facts",
    "[4]\nThe applicant, a citizen of Lebanon, has no status in Canada other than the refugee status granted by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.",
    "[5]\nHowever, the applicant obtained refugee status before the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) prepared a report setting out the relevant facts and transmitted that report to the Minister under subsection 44(1) of the IRPA. In the report, the CBSA alleged that it had reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant remained a foreign national who was inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA on grounds of violating human or international rights because he had committed an act outside Canada that constituted an offence referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the CAHWCA.",
    "[6]\nIt is clear from the documentary evidence in support of that report that the applicant was a member of the Christian Phalangist Party during the period when the Phalangist militia committed serious human rights violations in an area under the control of the Israeli forces. During that time, the applicant led a network of informers and obtained information that he sold to the top leadership of the Israeli secret service through Uric Lubrani, with whom the applicant had a highly privileged relationship. At the time, Lubrani was acting as a political advisor to Israel and was responsible for coordinating the Israeli forces' activities in Lebanon.",
    "[7]\nAfter analysing the CBSA's report and hearing the applicant's explanations concerning the report's allegations, the panel finally had to conclude that the report was well-founded and made the deportation order at issue in these proceedings.\nIV.\nImpugned decision",
    "[8]\nDespite its finding that the applicant's high rank in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) was in all likelihood only an honorary title and that he was not really part of that army or the army of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), the panel found that he had collaborated with senior Israeli military authorities for a long time by providing information to Uri Lubrani, who used it during operations led by the SLA in collaboration with the Israeli forces that controlled the Lebanese zone along the Israeli border.",
    "[9]\nAfter analysing the evidence, the panel was satisfied that the South Lebanon Army, then under the control of the Israeli forces, had committed serious crimes against the civilian population living on Lebanese territory bordering on Israel, including expulsion, rape and the imprisonment of persons not involved in the war, and had done so with the blessing of Uri Lubrani, who, during the lengthy conflict between Israel and the members of Hezbollah, had ultimate responsibility for using the information provided by the applicant against the civilian population of that area controlled by the Israeli forces.",
    "[10]\nFinally, the panel found that, while there was no doubt whatsoever that crimes against humanity had been committed by both the SLA and the Israeli forces during that lengthy conflict, the fact remained that, because of the applicant's position and privileged contact with Uri Lubrani, the senior Israeli official, it was reasonable to conclude that he could not be unaware of the crimes committed during the operations authorized by Lubrani on the strength of the information provided to him by the applicant. For this reason, the applicant was complicit in those crimes.\nV.\nIssues",
    "[11]\nThese proceedings raise only two issues:\na. In light of the evidence and the applicant's explanations, did the panel have sufficient reasonable grounds to form a rational belief that the applicant was a person referred to in paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA?\nb. Did the panel apply the wrong test in analysing the applicant's inadmissibility and, if so, would it be futile to order it to reconsider its decision?\nVI.\nAnalysis\n1.\nApplicable standards\na.\nStandard of proof",
    "[12]\nThe applicable standard of proof is set out in section 33 of the IRPA:\nRules of interpretation\n33.\nThe facts that constitute inadmissibility under sections 34 to 37 include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, include facts for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur.\n.........................\nInterprétation\n33.\nLes faits - actes ou omissions - mentionnés aux articles 34 à 37 sont, sauf disposition contraire, appréciés sur la base de motifs raisonnables de croire qu'ils sont survenus, surviennent ou peuvent survenir.",
    "[13]\nThis standard requires something more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities. In essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 114;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 39). This standard applies only to questions of fact ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 116).\nb.\nStandard of review",
    "[14]\nPurely factual findings that underlie the reasoning used by the panel in reaching its decision are subject to the standard of reasonableness. The question of whether the evidence establishes reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was complicit in the crimes alleged against him is subject to the same standard.",
    "[15]\nThe Court must therefore inquire into the qualities that make the decision reasonable. Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n2.\nOffence committed",
    "[16]\nIn making a deportation order against the applicant, the panel found that he had committed the offence of complicity in crimes against humanity committed outside Canada, which are provided for in paragraph 6(1)(\nb\n) of the CAHWCA and defined in subsection 6(3) of that Act.",
    "[17]\nThe word \"commits\" in relation to a crime, as used in paragraph 6(1)(\nb\n) of the CAHWCA, refers to and includes the various means of committing that crime. The person who \"commits\" the crime may be the actual perpetrator of the act personally or through an innocent agent, an aider, an abettor, an instigator or a counsellor of the criminal act committed. To put it differently, subsection 6(1) of the CAHWCA, which uses the word \"commits\" in relation to a crime against humanity, is no exception to the principle, generally accepted under domestic and customary international law, that complicity refers to methods or means of committing a crime and criminally engages those who are found to be accomplices (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 45-56).\n3. Crimes against humanity",
    "[18]\nThis Court has recognized that the crimes committed by the SLA and the IDF during the lengthy conflict with Hezbollah meet all the conditions for being properly characterized as crimes against humanity (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  affirmed at 2003 FCA 39;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[19]\nThe issue that arises is therefore whether it was reasonable for the panel to conclude that the applicant knew or ought to have known that, by providing information to the Israeli secret service concerning members of Hezbollah or other members of the resistance fighting against the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, he was assisting as an accomplice in the commission of crimes against humanity by the SLA and the IDF in southern Lebanon.\n4.\nAnalysis of the facts",
    "[20]\nThe applicant emphasizes the failure to analyse the widespread or systematic nature of the attacks. He argues that, while there are credible allegations about acts corresponding to the definition of crimes against humanity for which Israel or its representatives may be responsible, those acts were excesses committed by certain members of its forces or its allies and not acts committed by the country as part of a \"widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\".",
    "[21]\nHe further argues that he was given his honorary rank in the South Lebanon Army solely to facilitate his entry into Israel and that it cannot be inferred from his special collaboration with Lubrani that his knowledge of the crimes committed was sufficient for a finding of complicity.",
    "[22]\nFinally, the applicant submits that the panel applied the wrong test in its analysis of the facts, which led it to find him inadmissible.",
    "[23]\nThe applicant admitted that many crimes against humanity were committed by the SLA, the IDF and Hezbollah during the conflict, as recognized by the international community. However, he argued that, at the time he was working with the top leadership of the IDF, he was not aware that the SLA and the IDF were involved in those crimes. Unfortunately for the applicant, the panel found this part of his testimony \"neither credible nor trustworthy\".",
    "[24]\nThe Court sees nothing unreasonable about such a finding by the panel, which, in addition to hearing the applicant and being able to assess whether his explanations were credible, could not help but note that some very notorious crimes, the crimes at the Khiam prison being but one example, had been committed during the long period when the applicant had a privileged relationship with Lubrani and Lubrani had a say in the events occurring in the Lebanese zone occupied by the IDF.",
    "[25]\nThe panel could therefore reasonably conclude that the applicant knew or ought to have known that, by providing information to a high-level collaborator of the Israeli secret service and the IDF, which used that information during operations in southern Lebanon, he was assisting in the crimes against humanity committed by the SLA and the IDF during those operations. There is no doubt that, in doing so and cooperating closely with the person coordinating the IDF's activities in southern Lebanon, the applicant could not have been unaware of the important role played by his information, nor could he turn a blind eye to the many crimes against humanity committed in Lebanon during the long period when he had a privileged business relationship with Uri Lubrani (1984-1985 to 1999).",
    "[26]\nAccording to the case law, where an individual is or should be aware that information the individual provides to a group responsible for committing crimes against humanity, or information that may have harmful consequences for the persons it concerns (such as torture, rape, imprisonment without being charged or tried, mass expulsion of civilians from their territory), a panel may reasonably conclude that the individual was complicit, as that term is understood in international criminal law, in the crimes against humanity so committed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1996), 122 F.T.R. 263, at paragraphs 9, 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1998), 145 F.T.R. 297, at paragraphs 5-6, 24-25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1999), 180 F.T.R. 45, at paragraphs 5-8, 17, 40).",
    "[27]\nThe fact that the applicant was determined to be a\nConvention refugee\nbefore the decision under review here was made is not a valid reason for invalidating the decision, since, when the applicant obtained\nrefugee status\n, his inadmissibility was not in issue, which means that the subject matter of the claim was completely different; the Minister, acting in reliance on the CBSA's report, was therefore not deprived of his right to raise the issue later (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[28]\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that it was entirely reasonable in the circumstances for the panel to find the applicant inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA. The Court cannot reasonably believe that, having worked with Lubrani for more than 15 years, the applicant can now say that he was absolutely unaware of the major human rights violations that were common in his country during that time, particularly the serious and notorious crimes committed at the Khiam prison.\n5.\nStandard of inadmissibility",
    "[29]\nIn the alternative, the applicant stresses that the panel applied the wrong test in analysing his inadmissibility. He therefore submits that this in itself justifies allowing his application for judicial review.",
    "[30]\nAccording to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 114, there must be \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that a person has committed a crime against humanity, but, \"[i] n essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information\".",
    "[31]\nIn its decision, the panel explained the standard to be applied as follows: [11] The panel therefore had to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that this allegation was justified. According to case law, the test of reasonable grounds to believe is less than a balance of probabilities, but more than mere suspicion.",
    "[32]\nAlthough the panel's definition does not correspond word for word to the one in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Court is of the view that the futility of reconsidering the decision justifies denying the remedy sought (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[33]\nIn light of the applicant's admissions, the role he played and the panel's refusal to give credence to his statement that he did not know about the crimes in question, the Court believes that it would be futile to set aside the decision and refer the matter to a differently constituted panel for reconsideration. The applicant has not satisfied the Court that a differently constituted panel would reach a different conclusion even if it followed the teachings of the Supreme Court to the letter.\nVII.\nConclusion",
    "[34]\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the decision is not unreasonable, which means that the application for judicial review must be dismissed. Since no serious question of general importance has been proposed and the Court sees no such question here to be certified, no question will be certified.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[35]\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n:\nDISMISSES the application for judicial review.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Lagacé\n: The applicant requests, under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), the judicial review of the decision rendered on June 18, 2008, by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Tribunal), which had the effect of issuing a deportation order against the applicant, after determining that he had violated human or international rights, which resulted in an inadmissibility against him under paragraph 35(1)\nhas\n) of the IRPA.\nII.\nRelevant legislation"

There is no doubt that, in doing so and cooperating closely with the person coordinating the IDF's activities in southern Lebanon, the applicant could not have been unaware of the important role played by his information, nor could he turn a blind eye to the many crimes against humanity committed in Lebanon during the long period when he had a privileged business relationship with Uri Lubrani (1984-1985 to 1999).\n[26]\nAccording to the case law, where an individual is or should be aware that information the individual provides to a group responsible for committing crimes against humanity, or information that may have harmful consequences for the persons it concerns (such as torture, rape, imprisonment without being charged or tried, mass expulsion of civilians from their territory), a panel may reasonably conclude that the individual was complicit, as that term is understood in international criminal law, in the crimes against humanity so committed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1996), 122 F.T.R. 263, at paragraphs 9, 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1998), 145 F.T.R. 297, at paragraphs 5-6, 24-25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1999), 180 F.T.R. 45, at paragraphs 5-8, 17, 40).\n[27]\nThe fact that the applicant was determined to be a\nConvention refugee\nbefore the decision under review here was made is not a valid reason for invalidating the decision, since, when the applicant obtained\nrefugee status\n, his inadmissibility was not in issue, which means that the subject matter of the claim was completely different; the Minister, acting in reliance on the CBSA's report, was therefore not deprived of his right to raise the issue later (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[28]\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that it was entirely reasonable in the circumstances for the panel to find the applicant inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA. The Court cannot reasonably believe that, having worked with Lubrani for more than 15 years, the applicant can now say that he was absolutely unaware of the major human rights violations that were common in his country during that time, particularly the serious and notorious crimes committed at the Khiam prison.\n5.\nStandard of inadmissibility\n[29]\nIn the alternative, the applicant stresses that the panel applied the wrong test in analysing his inadmissibility. He therefore submits that this in itself justifies allowing his application for judicial review.\n[30]\nAccording to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 114, there must be \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that a person has committed a crime against humanity, but, \"[i] n essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information\".\n[31]\nIn its decision, the panel explained the standard to be applied as follows:\n[11] The panel therefore had to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that this allegation was justified. According to case law, the test of reasonable grounds to believe is less than a balance of probabilities, but more than mere suspicion.\n[32]\nAlthough the panel's definition does not correspond word for word to the one in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Court is of the view that the futility of reconsidering the decision justifies denying the remedy sought (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[33]\nIn light of the applicant's admissions, the role he played and the panel's refusal to give credence to his statement that he did not know about the crimes in question, the Court believes that it would be futile to set aside the decision and refer the matter to a differently constituted panel for reconsideration. The applicant has not satisfied the Court that a differently constituted panel would reach a different conclusion even if it followed the teachings of the Supreme Court to the letter.\nVII.\nConclusion\n[34]\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the decision is not unreasonable, which means that the application for judicial review must be dismissed. Since no serious question of general importance has been proposed and the Court sees no such question here to be certified, no question will be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n[35]\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n:\nDISMISSES the application for judicial review.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Lagacé\n: Le demandeur sollicite, en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 (LIPR), le contrôle judiciaire de la décision rendue le 18 juin 2008, par la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (le Tribunal), et ayant pour effet d'émettre une mesure d'expulsion à l'encontre du demandeur, après détermination qu'il avait porté atteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux, ce qui emportait contre lui une interdiction de territoire aux termes de l'alinéa 35(1)\na\n) de la LIPR.\nII.\nLégislation pertinente\n[2]\nL'alinéa 35(1)\na\n) de la LIPR se lit comme suit:\nAtteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux\n35.\n(1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour atteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux les faits suivants:\na) commettre, hors du Canada, une des infractions visées aux articles 4 à 7 de la\nLoi sur les crimes contre l'humanité et les crimes de guerre\n;\nHuman or international rights violations\n35.\n(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for\n(\na\n) committing an act outside Canada that constitutes an offence referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n;\n[3]\nLe Tribunal retient contre le demandeur des crimes contre l'humanité commis à l'étranger, crimes prévus à l'alinéa 6(1)\nb\n) de la\nLoi sur les crimes contre l'humanité et les crimes de guerre\n, L.C. 2000, ch. 24 (LCCHCG), tels que définis au paragraphe 6(3) de cette loi. Ces dispositions se lisent comme suit:\nGénocide, crime contre l'humanité(CCH), etc., commis à l'étranger\n6.\n(1) Quiconque commet à l'étranger une des infractions ci-après, avant ou après l'entrée en vigueur du présent article, est coupable d'un acte criminel et peut être poursuivi pour cette infraction aux termes de l'article 8:\n[...]\nb) crime contre l'humanité;\n[...]\nDéfinitions\n(3) Les définitions qui suivent s'appliquent au présent article.\ncrime contre l'humanité \n\"crime against humanity\n\"\ncrime contre l'humanité  Meurtre, extermination, réduction en esclavage, déportation, emprisonnement, torture, violence sexuelle, persécution ou autre fait - acte ou omission - inhumain, d'une part, commis contre une population civile ou un groupe identifiable de personnes et, d'autre part, qui constitue, au moment et au lieu de la perpétration, un crime contre l'humanité selon le droit international coutumier ou le droit international conventionnel ou en raison de son caractère criminel d'après les principes généraux de droit reconnus par l'ensemble des nations, qu'il constitue ou non une transgression du droit en vigueur à ce moment et dans ce lieu.\nGenocide, etc., committed outside Canada\n6.\n(1) Every person who, either before or after the coming into force of this section, commits outside Canada\n[...]\n(\nb\n) a crime against humanity, or\n[...]\nDefinitions\n(3) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\"crime against humanity\"\ncrime contre l'humanité\n\"crime against humanity\" means murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution or any other inhumane act or omission that is committed against any civilian population or any identifiable group and that, at the time and in the place of its commission, constitutes a crime against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by virtue of its being criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations, whether or not it constitutes a contravention of the law in force at the time and in the place of its commission.\nIII.\nRésumé des faits\n[4]\nCitoyen du Liban, le demandeur ne possède aucun statut au Canada autre que celui de  réfugié  reconnu par la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié du Canada.\n[5]\nCependant, le demandeur obtient ce statut de réfugié avant le rapport circonstancié de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC) transmis au ministre au terme du paragraphe 44(1) de la LIPR, et dans lequel l'ASFC allègue avoir des motifs raisonnables de croire que le demandeur demeure un étranger interdit de territoire pour atteinte aux droits humains ou internationaux, en vertu de l'alinéa 35(1)\na\n) de la LIPR, parce qu'il aurait commis, hors du Canada, une des infractions visées aux articles 4 à 7 de la LCCHCG.\n[6]\nIl ressort clairement de la preuve documentaire à l'appui de ce rapport que le demandeur a été membre du Parti chrétien phalangiste durant la période où les milices phalangistes se rendaient coupables de graves violations de droits humains sur un territoire sous le contrôle des forces israéliennes. Pendant ce temps, le demandeur dirigeait un réseau d'informateurs, et obtenaient des renseignements qu'il vendait à la haute direction des services secrets israéliens par l'intermédiaire de Uric Lubrani, avec qui le demandeur maintenait une relation tout à fait privilégiée. Or, il s'avère que Lubrani agissait à cette époque comme conseiller politique d'Israël avec charge de coordonner les activités des forces israéliennes au Liban.\n[7]\nAprès avoir analysé ce rapport de l'ASFC et entendu les explications du demandeur sur les reproches qu'il contient, le Tribunal devait finalement conclure au bien fondé du rapport et émettait la mesure d'expulsion contestée par le présent recours.\nIV.\nDécision contestée\n[8]\nMalgré sa conclusion à l'effet que le demandeur n'avait en toute probabilité qu'un titre honorifique de haut gradé dans l'Armée du Liban sud (ALS) et qu'il ne faisait véritablement pas partie de cette armée, ni de celle des Forces de défenses d'Israël (FDI), le Tribunal n'en retient pas moins que le demandeur a collaboré sur une longue période avec les hautes instances militaires israéliennes, en fournissant des renseignements à Uri Lubrani qui les utilisait dans le cours des opérations menées par l'ALS en coordination avec les forces israéliennes qui contrôlaient la zone libanaise située le long de la frontière israélienne.\n[9]\nAprès avoir analysé la preuve, le Tribunal se convainc que l'Armé du Liban sud, alors sous le contrôle des forces israéliennes, s'est rendue responsable de crimes graves envers la population civile vivant sur le territoire libanais limitrophe à Israël: expulsion de territoire, viols, emprisonnement de personnes non impliquées dans la guerre, et ce, avec la bénédiction de Uri Lubrani qui avait, pendant la longue période du conflit d'Israël avec les membres du Hezbollah, l'ultime responsabilité d'utiliser les renseignements fournis par le demandeur contre la population civile de cette région alors contrôlée par les forces israéliennes.\n[10]\nFinalement, le Tribunal conclut que si sans l'ombre d'un doute des crimes contre l'humanité ont été commis, tant par l'ALS que les forces israéliennes lors de ce long conflit, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'en raison de la position du demandeur et ses contacts privilégiés avec monsieur Uri Lubrani, lui-même haut responsable israélien, il est raisonnable pour le Tribunal de conclure que le demandeur ne pouvait pas ignorer les crimes commis lors des opérations autorisées par Lubrani sur la foi des renseignements que lui fournissait le demandeur, d'où la complicité du demandeur pour ces crimes.\nV.\nQuestions en litige\n[11]\nLe présent recours soulève deux seules questions:\na. Le Tribunal avait-il, eu égard à la preuve et les explications du demandeur, des motifs raisonnables suffisants pour lui permettre de croire de façon rationnelle que le demandeur était une personne visée par l'alinéa 35(1)\na\n) de la LIPR?\nb. Le Tribunal a-t-il appliqué le mauvais test lors de son analyse de l'inadmissibilité demandeur, et dans l'affirmative, serait-il futile d'ordonner qu'il reconsidère sa décision?\nVI.\nAnalyse\n1.\nNormes applicables\na.\nNorme de preuve\n[12]\nLa norme de preuve applicable est prévue à l'article 33 de la LIPR, selon lequel:\nInterprétation\n33.\nLes faits - actes ou omissions - mentionnés aux articles 34 à 37 sont, sauf disposition contraire, appréciés sur la base de motifs raisonnables de croire qu'ils sont survenus, surviennent ou peuvent survenir.\nRules of interpretation\n33.\nThe facts that constitute inadmissibility under sections 34 to 37 include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, include facts for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred are occurring or may occur.\n[13]\nCette norme exige davantage qu'un simple soupçon, mais reste moins stricte que la prépondérance des probabilités applicable en matière civile. La croyance doit essentiellement posséder un fondement objectif s'appuyant sur des renseignements concluants et dignes de foi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 114;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 39). Elle ne s'applique qu'aux questions de fait ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, par. 116).\nb.\nNorme de contrôle\n[14]\nLes conclusions purement factuelles, sous-jacentes au raisonnement du Tribunal pour parvenir à sa décision, sont assujetties à la norme de la décision déraisonnable. La question de savoir si la preuve permet d'établir des motifs raisonnables de croire que le demandeur fut complice des crimes qu'on lui reproche est soumise à la même norme.\n[15]\nLa Cour doit par conséquent se demander si la décision possède les attributs de la raisonnabilité qui tiennent principalement à sa justification, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 47).\n2.\nL'infraction retenue\n[16]\nPour émettre contre le demandeur une mesure d'expulsion, le Tribunal retient contre lui l'infraction de complicité de crimes contre l'humanité commis à l'étranger, crime prévu à l'alinéa 6(1)\nb\n) de la LCCHCG et défini au paragraphe 6(3) de la même loi.\n[17]\nS'agissant d'un crime, la loi vise et englobe par le mot  commet  utilisé à l'alinéa 6(1)\nb\n) de la LCCHCG les divers moyens employés pour perpétrer ce crime. Celui qui  commet  le crime peut être la personne qui en est personnellement l'auteur ou qui agit par l'entremise d'un tiers de bonne foi, ou encore qui fournit aide, encouragement ou conseil à l'égard de l'acte criminel. En d'autres termes, le paragraphe 6(1) de la LCCHCG, qui emploie le mot  commet  pour parler des crimes contre l'humanité, ne fait pas exception à la règle généralement admise en droit interne et en droit coutumier international, suivant laquelle la complicité s'entend de méthodes ou de moyens employés pour commettre un crime, ce qui engage la responsabilité criminelle de ceux qui sont jugés complices (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , par. 45-56).\n3. Crimes contre l'humanité\n[18]\nCette Cour a reconnu que les crimes commis par l'ALS et les FDI lors du long conflit avec l'Hezbollah satisfont à toutes les conditions pour qu'ils puissent être à bon droit qualifiés de crimes contre l'humanité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  confirmée à 2003 CAF 39;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[19]\nPar conséquent, la question qui se pose est de savoir s'il était raisonnable pour le Tribunal de conclure que le demandeur savait ou aurait dû savoir, qu'en fournissant des renseignements aux services secrets israéliens sur les membres du Hezbollah ou sur d'autres résistants à l'occupation israélienne au Liban, il prêtait son concours comme complice à la commission par l'ALS et les FDI au sud du Liban de crimes contre l'humanité.\n4.\nAnalyse des faits\n[20]\nLe demandeur insiste sur l'absence d'analyse du caractère généralisé ou systématique des attaques. Il prétend que s'il existe des allégations crédibles d'actes correspondant à la définition de crime contre l'humanité, et dont Israël ou ses représentants peuvent être responsables, il s'agit là de dérapages de certains membres de ses forces ou de ses alliés et non pas d'actes commis par le pays lors d'une  attaque généralisée ou systématique contre des populations civiles. \n[21]\nIl soutient de plus que son grade honorifique dans l'Armée du Liban sud lui avait été conféré seulement pour faciliter son passage en Israël, et que sa collaboration privilégiée avec Lubrani ne permet pas de lui imputer une connaissance suffisante des crimes commis pour pouvoir conclure à sa complicité.\n[22]\nFinalement, le demandeur affirme que le Tribunal a appliqué le mauvais test lors de l'analyse des faits qui lui permet de conclure à son interdiction de territoire.\n[23]\nLe demandeur a admis, ce que la communauté internationale reconnaît d'ailleurs, que de nombreux crimes contre l'humanité ont été commis à l'occasion de ce conflit, et ce tant du côté de l'ALS, des FDI que de l'Hezbollah. Mais il affirme qu'à l'époque de sa collaboration avec la haute direction des FDI, il ignorait la participation de l'ALS et des FDI dans ces crimes. Malheureusement pour le demandeur, le Tribunal a jugé cette partie de son témoignage  ni crédible, ni digne de foi .\n[24]\nLa Cour ne voit rien de déraisonnable dans une telle conclusion par le Tribunal, qui en plus d'avoir entendu le demandeur et d'avoir pu juger de sa crédibilité quant à ses explications, ne pouvait faire autrement que de noter que certains crimes très notoires, pour ne citer que ceux de la prison de Khiam, avaient été commis pendant la longue relation privilégiée que le demandeur avait maintenue avec Lubrani, et ce alors que celui-ci avait son mot à dire dans les évènements qui se déroulaient dans la zone libanaise occupée par les FDI.\n[25]\nLe Tribunal pouvait ainsi raisonnablement conclure que le demandeur savait ou devait savoir qu'en fournissant des renseignements à un haut collaborateur des services secrets israéliens et des FDI qui s'en servaient par la suite lors d'opérations au sud du Liban dans les opérations, il prêtait son concours aux crimes contre l'humanité commis par l'ALS et les FDI lors de ces opérations. Nul doute qu'en agissant ainsi et en coopérant étroitement avec le coordonnateur des activités du FDI au sud du Liban, le demandeur ne pouvait ignorer le rôle important de ses renseignements pas plus qu'il ne pouvait fermer les yeux sur les nombreux crimes contre l'humanité perpétrés au Liban pendant la longue sa longue relation d'affaires privilégiée (1984-1985 à 1999) avec Uri Lubrani.\n[26]\nLa jurisprudence enseigne que lorsqu'un individu est conscient, ou devrait l'être, que les informations qu'il fournit à un groupe responsable de commettre des crimes contre l'humanité, ou pouvant avoir des conséquences néfastes pour les personnes au sujet desquelles il fournit ces informations (tels la torture, le viol, l'emprisonnement sans accusation ni procès, l'expulsion massive de civils de leur territoire), un tribunal peut alors raisonnablement conclure que cet individu fut complice, au sens du droit pénal international, des crimes commis contre l'humanité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; (1996) 122 F.T.R. 263, par. 9, 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 9-10, 12, 15;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; (1998) 145 F.T.R. 297, par. 5-6, 24-25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 3, 4, 11-16;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; (1999) 180 F.T.R. 45, par. 5-8, 17, 40).\n[27]\nLe fait que le demandeur ait été reconnu\nréfugié au sens de la Convention\navant la décision visée par le présent recours ne constitue pas un motif valable pour invalider la décision, puisque lorsque le demandeur obtint\nle statut de réfugié\nla question de son interdiction de territoire n'était pas en cause, de sorte que l'objet de la demande différait totalement; en conséquence le ministre, agissant sur la foi du rapport de l'ASFC, n'était pas privé de son droit de soulever la question plus tard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[28]\nEn conséquence, la Cour conclut qu'il était tout à fait raisonnable pour le Tribunal dans les circonstances d'imposer au demandeur une interdiction de territoire en vertu de l'alinéa 35(1)\na\n) de la LIPR. La Cour ne peut raisonnablement croire qu'ayant travaillé plus de 15 ans auprès du dénommé Lubrani, le demandeur puisse aujourd'hui affirmer qu'il n'était absolument pas au courant des importantes violations des droits de la personne qui avaient cours à cette époque dans son pays, et notamment des crimes graves et notoires commis à la prison de Khiam.\n5.\nNorme d'inadmissibilité\n[29]\nLe demandeur insiste subsidiairement sur le fait que le Tribunal a appliqué le mauvais test lors de son analyse de son inadmissibilité. Il estime en conséquence que ce fait justifie à lui seul d'accorder sa demande de révision judiciaire.\n[30]\nL'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> précité, au paragraphe 114, enseigne qu'il faut qu'il existe des  motifs raisonnables [de penser]  qu'une personne a commis un crime contre l'humanité mais que  la croyance doit essentiellement posséder un fondement objectif reposant sur des renseignements concluants et dignes de foi. \n[31]\nOr, dans sa décision le Tribunal expose la norme à appliquer comme suit:\n[11] Nous avions donc à déterminer s'il y avait des motifs raisonnables de croire que cette allégation était fondée. Les motifs raisonnables de croire, selon la jurisprudence, est un test à appliquer qui est moindre que la balance des probabilités, mais plus que de simples soupçons.\n[32]\nBien que la définition citée par le Tribunal ne correspond pas mot à mot avec celle qu'enseigne l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la Cour considère toutefois que la futilité de reconsidérer la décision justifie le refus du remède demandé (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[33]\nConsidérant les admissions du demandeur, le rôle qu'il a joué et le refus du Tribunal de prêter foi à sa déclaration de non connaissance des crimes reprochés, le Tribunal croit qu'il serait futile d'annuler la décision et de référer le dossier à un Tribunal autrement constitué, pour reconsidération. Le demandeur n'a pas convaincu la Cour que même en suivant à la lettre l'enseignement de la Cour suprême, un Tribunal autrement constitué conclurait différemment.\nVII.\nConclusion\n[34]\nPour ces motifs, la Cour conclut que la décision n'est pas déraisonnable, ce qui entraîne le rejet de la demande de révision judiciaire. Et puisque aucune question importante de portée générale n'a été proposée et que la Cour n'en voit aucune ici à certifier, aucune question ne sera certifiée.\nJUGEMENT\n[35]\nPOUR CES MOTIFS, LA COUR\n:\nREJETTE la demande de contrôle judiciaire.\n[End of document]",

Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI.\nIntroduction\n\n[1]\nLagacé, D.J.\n[Translation]: The applicant is applying under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), for judicial review of the decision made on June 18, 2008 by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the panel), in which the panel made a deportation order against the applicant after determining that he had violated human or international rights, which made him inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA.\nII.\nRelevant legislation\n\n[2]\nSubsection 35(1)(\nhas\n) of the IRPA reads as follows:\nHuman or international rights violations\n35.\n(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for\n(\nhas\n) committing an act outside Canada that constitutes an offense referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n;\n.........................\nViolation of human or international rights\n35.\n(1) The following facts result in inadmissibility for violation of human or international rights:\n(a) commit, outside Canada, one of the offenses set out in sections 4 to 7 of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n;\n\n[3]\nThe panel found that the applicant had committed crimes against humanity outside Canada. Such crimes are provided for in paragraph 6(1)(\nb\n) of the\nCrimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\n, S.C. 2000, c. 24 (CAHWCA), and are defined in subsection 6(3) of that Act. Those provisions read as follows:\nGenocide, etc., committed outside Canada\n6.\n(1) Every person who, either before or after the coming into force of this section, commits outside Canada\n...\n(\nb\n) a crime against humanity, or\n...\nDefinitions\n(3) The definitions in this subsection apply in this section.\n\"crime against humanity\"\ncrime against humanity \n\"crime against humanity\" means murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution or any other inhumane act or omission that is committed against any civilian population or any identifiable group and that, at the time and in the place of its commission, constitutes a crime against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by virtue of its being criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations, whether or not it constitutes a contravention of the law in force at the time and in the place of its commission.\n.........................\nGenocide, crime against humanity (CCH), etc., committed abroad\n6.\n(1) Every person who commits any of the following offenses abroad, before or after the coming into force of this section, is guilty of an indictable offense and may be prosecuted for that offense under section 8:\n[...]\n(b) crime against humanity;\n[...]\nDefinitions\n(3) The following definitions apply in this section.\ncrime against humanity\n\"\ncrime against humanity\n\"\ncrime against humanity Murder, extermination, reduction into slavery, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution or other act - act or omission - inhumane, on the one hand, committed against a civilian population or an identifiable group of persons and, on the other hand, which constitutes, at the time and place of the perpetration, a crime against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by reason of its criminal character according to the general principles of law recognized by all nations, whether or not it constitutes a transgression of the law in force at that time and place.\nIII.\nSummary of the facts\n\n[4]\nThe applicant, a citizen of Lebanon, has no status in Canada other than the refugee status granted by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.\n\n[5]\nHowever, the applicant obtained refugee status before the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) prepared a report setting out the relevant facts and transmitted that report to the Minister under subsection 44(1) of the IRPA. In the report, the CBSA alleged that it had reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant remained a foreign national who was inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA on grounds of violating human or international rights because he had committed an act outside Canada that constituted an offence referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the CAHWCA.\n\n[6]\nIt is clear from the documentary evidence in support of that report that the applicant was a member of the Christian Phalangist Party during the period when the Phalangist militia committed serious human rights violations in an area under the control of the Israeli forces. During that time, the applicant led a network of informers and obtained information that he sold to the top leadership of the Israeli secret service through Uric Lubrani, with whom the applicant had a highly privileged relationship. At the time, Lubrani was acting as a political advisor to Israel and was responsible for coordinating the Israeli forces' activities in Lebanon.\n\n[7]\nAfter analysing the CBSA's report and hearing the applicant's explanations concerning the report's allegations, the panel finally had to conclude that the report was well-founded and made the deportation order at issue in these proceedings.\nIV.\nImpugned decision\n\n[8]\nDespite its finding that the applicant's high rank in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) was in all likelihood only an honorary title and that he was not really part of that army or the army of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), the panel found that he had collaborated with senior Israeli military authorities for a long time by providing information to Uri Lubrani, who used it during operations led by the SLA in collaboration with the Israeli forces that controlled the Lebanese zone along the Israeli border.\n\n[9]\nAfter analysing the evidence, the panel was satisfied that the South Lebanon Army, then under the control of the Israeli forces, had committed serious crimes against the civilian population living on Lebanese territory bordering on Israel, including expulsion, rape and the imprisonment of persons not involved in the war, and had done so with the blessing of Uri Lubrani, who, during the lengthy conflict between Israel and the members of Hezbollah, had ultimate responsibility for using the information provided by the applicant against the civilian population of that area controlled by the Israeli forces.\n\n[10]\nFinally, the panel found that, while there was no doubt whatsoever that crimes against humanity had been committed by both the SLA and the Israeli forces during that lengthy conflict, the fact remained that, because of the applicant's position and privileged contact with Uri Lubrani, the senior Israeli official, it was reasonable to conclude that he could not be unaware of the crimes committed during the operations authorized by Lubrani on the strength of the information provided to him by the applicant. For this reason, the applicant was complicit in those crimes.\nV.\nIssues\n\n[11]\nThese proceedings raise only two issues:\na. In light of the evidence and the applicant's explanations, did the panel have sufficient reasonable grounds to form a rational belief that the applicant was a person referred to in paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA?\nb. Did the panel apply the wrong test in analysing the applicant's inadmissibility and, if so, would it be futile to order it to reconsider its decision?\nVI.\nAnalysis\n1.\nApplicable standards\na.\nStandard of proof\n\n[12]\nThe applicable standard of proof is set out in section 33 of the IRPA:\nRules of interpretation\n33.\nThe facts that constitute inadmissibility under sections 34 to 37 include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, include facts for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur.\n.........................\nInterprétation\n33.\nLes faits - actes ou omissions - mentionnés aux articles 34 à 37 sont, sauf disposition contraire, appréciés sur la base de motifs raisonnables de croire qu'ils sont survenus, surviennent ou peuvent survenir.\n\n[13]\nThis standard requires something more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities. In essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 114;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraph 39). This standard applies only to questions of fact ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 116).\nb.\nStandard of review\n\n[14]\nPurely factual findings that underlie the reasoning used by the panel in reaching its decision are subject to the standard of reasonableness. The question of whether the evidence establishes reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was complicit in the crimes alleged against him is subject to the same standard.\n\n[15]\nThe Court must therefore inquire into the qualities that make the decision reasonable. Reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process but also with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n2.\nOffence committed\n\n[16]\nIn making a deportation order against the applicant, the panel found that he had committed the offence of complicity in crimes against humanity committed outside Canada, which are provided for in paragraph 6(1)(\nb\n) of the CAHWCA and defined in subsection 6(3) of that Act.\n\n[17]\nThe word \"commits\" in relation to a crime, as used in paragraph 6(1)(\nb\n) of the CAHWCA, refers to and includes the various means of committing that crime. The person who \"commits\" the crime may be the actual perpetrator of the act personally or through an innocent agent, an aider, an abettor, an instigator or a counsellor of the criminal act committed. To put it differently, subsection 6(1) of the CAHWCA, which uses the word \"commits\" in relation to a crime against humanity, is no exception to the principle, generally accepted under domestic and customary international law, that complicity refers to methods or means of committing a crime and criminally engages those who are found to be accomplices (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 45-56).\n3. Crimes against humanity\n\n[18]\nThis Court has recognized that the crimes committed by the SLA and the IDF during the lengthy conflict with Hezbollah meet all the conditions for being properly characterized as crimes against humanity (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  affirmed at 2003 FCA 39;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[19]\nThe issue that arises is therefore whether it was reasonable for the panel to conclude that the applicant knew or ought to have known that, by providing information to the Israeli secret service concerning members of Hezbollah or other members of the resistance fighting against the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, he was assisting as an accomplice in the commission of crimes against humanity by the SLA and the IDF in southern Lebanon.\n4.\nAnalysis of the facts\n\n[20]\nThe applicant emphasizes the failure to analyse the widespread or systematic nature of the attacks. He argues that, while there are credible allegations about acts corresponding to the definition of crimes against humanity for which Israel or its representatives may be responsible, those acts were excesses committed by certain members of its forces or its allies and not acts committed by the country as part of a \"widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\".\n\n[21]\nHe further argues that he was given his honorary rank in the South Lebanon Army solely to facilitate his entry into Israel and that it cannot be inferred from his special collaboration with Lubrani that his knowledge of the crimes committed was sufficient for a finding of complicity.\n\n[22]\nFinally, the applicant submits that the panel applied the wrong test in its analysis of the facts, which led it to find him inadmissible.\n\n[23]\nThe applicant admitted that many crimes against humanity were committed by the SLA, the IDF and Hezbollah during the conflict, as recognized by the international community. However, he argued that, at the time he was working with the top leadership of the IDF, he was not aware that the SLA and the IDF were involved in those crimes. Unfortunately for the applicant, the panel found this part of his testimony \"neither credible nor trustworthy\".\n\n[24]\nThe Court sees nothing unreasonable about such a finding by the panel, which, in addition to hearing the applicant and being able to assess whether his explanations were credible, could not help but note that some very notorious crimes, the crimes at the Khiam prison being but one example, had been committed during the long period when the applicant had a privileged relationship with Lubrani and Lubrani had a say in the events occurring in the Lebanese zone occupied by the IDF.\n\n[25]\nThe panel could therefore reasonably conclude that the applicant knew or ought to have known that, by providing information to a high-level collaborator of the Israeli secret service and the IDF, which used that information during operations in southern Lebanon, he was assisting in the crimes against humanity committed by the SLA and the IDF during those operations. There is no doubt that, in doing so and cooperating closely with the person coordinating the IDF's activities in southern Lebanon, the applicant could not have been unaware of the important role played by his information, nor could he turn a blind eye to the many crimes against humanity committed in Lebanon during the long period when he had a privileged business relationship with Uri Lubrani (1984-1985 to 1999).\n\n[26]\nAccording to the case law, where an individual is or should be aware that information the individual provides to a group responsible for committing crimes against humanity, or information that may have harmful consequences for the persons it concerns (such as torture, rape, imprisonment without being charged or tried, mass expulsion of civilians from their territory), a panel may reasonably conclude that the individual was complicit, as that term is understood in international criminal law, in the crimes against humanity so committed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1996), 122 F.T.R. 263, at paragraphs 9, 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1998), 145 F.T.R. 297, at paragraphs 5-6, 24-25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1999), 180 F.T.R. 45, at paragraphs 5-8, 17, 40).\n\n[27]\nThe fact that the applicant was determined to be a\nConvention refugee\nbefore the decision under review here was made is not a valid reason for invalidating the decision, since, when the applicant obtained\nrefugee status\n, his inadmissibility was not in issue, which means that the subject matter of the claim was completely different; the Minister, acting in reliance on the CBSA's report, was therefore not deprived of his right to raise the issue later (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[28]\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that it was entirely reasonable in the circumstances for the panel to find the applicant inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(\na\n) of the IRPA. The Court cannot reasonably believe that, having worked with Lubrani for more than 15 years, the applicant can now say that he was absolutely unaware of the major human rights violations that were common in his country during that time, particularly the serious and notorious crimes committed at the Khiam prison.\n5.\nStandard of inadmissibility\n\n[29]\nIn the alternative, the applicant stresses that the panel applied the wrong test in analysing his inadmissibility. He therefore submits that this in itself justifies allowing his application for judicial review.\n\n[30]\nAccording to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paragraph 114, there must be \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that a person has committed a crime against humanity, but, \"[i] n essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information\".\n\n[31]\nIn its decision, the panel explained the standard to be applied as follows: [11] The panel therefore had to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that this allegation was justified. According to case law, the test of reasonable grounds to believe is less than a balance of probabilities, but more than mere suspicion.\n\n[32]\nAlthough the panel's definition does not correspond word for word to the one in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Court is of the view that the futility of reconsidering the decision justifies denying the remedy sought (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[33]\nIn light of the applicant's admissions, the role he played and the panel's refusal to give credence to his statement that he did not know about the crimes in question, the Court believes that it would be futile to set aside the decision and refer the matter to a differently constituted panel for reconsideration. The applicant has not satisfied the Court that a differently constituted panel would reach a different conclusion even if it followed the teachings of the Supreme Court to the letter.\nVII.\nConclusion\n\n[34]\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the decision is not unreasonable, which means that the application for judicial review must be dismissed. Since no serious question of general importance has been proposed and the Court sees no such question here to be certified, no question will be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[35]\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n:\nDISMISSES the application for judicial review.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Lagacé\n: The applicant requests, under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), the judicial review of the decision rendered on June 18, 2008, by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Tribunal), which had the effect of issuing a deportation order against the applicant, after determining that he had violated human or international rights, which resulted in an inadmissibility against him under paragraph 35(1)\nhas\n) of the IRPA.\nII.\nRelevant legislation",
