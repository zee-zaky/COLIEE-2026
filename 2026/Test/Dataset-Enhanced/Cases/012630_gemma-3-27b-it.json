    "[1]\nHargrave, Prothonotary\n: The plaintiffs, by an ex parte motion on April 22, 1996, sought to extend time for service of the Statement of Claim, both in rem on the \"Imperial Confidence\" and in personam on Welsen Shipping Co. Ltd., who are said to be the shipowners.",
    "[2]\nIn that it appeared that the \"Imperial Confidence\" had not been available for service in this jurisdiction since the Statement of Claim was issued, December 30, 1994, I granted that portion of the motion, of course without prejudice to the shipowner moving to set aside the Order in the event that the plaintiffs had overlooked an opportunity to serve the \"Imperial Confidence\" within the jurisdiction. These reasons arise out of the request for the extension of time within which to accomplish service in personam on Welsen Shipping Co. Ltd.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe Statement of Claim was filed December 30, 1994. The material shows both that the shipowner's P & I Club's commercial correspondent in Vancouver was aware of the filing of the Statement of Claim and that he had obtained a copy of it at an early date. It also shows timely service on Greer Shipping Ltd., initially thought to be the shipowner's Vancouver agents, pursuant to rule 310(2).",
    "[4]\nAs set out in the Affidavit of Service of Marna Langner, she served Greer Shipping Ltd. personally on September 14, 1995, at their office, 1520 - 200 Burrard Street in Vancouver. Served along with the certified copy of what was by then the Amended Statement of Claim was a covering letter setting out service of Greer Shipping Ltd. as agents for the \"Imperial Confidence\", pursuant to rule 310. The letter went on to ask Greer Shipping to bring the matter to the attention of P & I solicitors.",
    "[5]\nThe affidavit material indicates that service on Greer Shipping was requested by Marine Office of America Corporation, whom it appears were underwriters of the cargo. However, the solicitors for the plaintiffs were advised by Greer Shipping, nearly four months after the Statement of Claim had expired, that Greer Shipping acted not as agents for the owners, but only as agents for the charterers. Welsen Shipping now advise, through their Vancouver commercial P & I representative, that they are taking the position that they have not been properly served.\nPlaintiffs' Submissions",
    "[6]\nCounsel for the plaintiffs refers to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). In that case the defendants were aware that the action had been started and indeed had received a copy of the Statement of Claim, together with the advice that failing a resolution the Statement of Claim would be served in three weeks. In due course, counsel instructed that the Statement of Claim be served. However, that was not done until after the Statement of Claim had expired. Mr. Justice Joyal,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Fortin\n, referred to rule 306, which governs service, as being flexible in that it confers a discretion to grant an extension of time. In addition, he noted that by rule 302 formalism is not a part of the general scheme of the\nRules\nand therefore the court can, on occasion, intervene to regularize or legitimise a discrepancy (p. 212). He then said:\n\" [14] It is clear from this analysis that, on the one hand, the rules of procedure must be observed, but on the other, any blunders or defects of form or inadvertence should not be allowed to impede the disposition of a given case on the merits.\" (p. 212)",
    "[7]\nIn granting an extension in the\nLaval Fortin\ncase Mr. Justice Joyal characterized what happened not as a laxity, but as a mere slip in practice. Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the\nLaval Fortin\ncase is analogous to the present situation.\nAnalysis",
    "[8]\nMore recently Mr. Justice Pinard considered an extension of time for service in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  counsel seeking the extension pleaded, as a reason for the extension of time, inadvertence in diarizing the file to insure that the Statement of Claim might be served in a timely manner. Mr. Justice Pinard referred to\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) at 404  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Chief Justice Jackett, for the Court of Appeal, said:\n\"In my view, the material submitted in support of the ex parte orders extending time disclosed no 'sufficient' reason for extending the time for service. An obvious 'sufficient reason' would be that the defendant was avoiding service. There are, of course, other sufficient reasons. In my view, however, when the defendant was available for service and the plaintiff was not inhibited from serving or induced by the defendant not to serve, it is almost impossible to think of a 'sufficient reason' for not serving within the time fixed for serving. The material filed in support of the two orders extending time does not reveal any facts that, in my view, disclose 'sufficient reason'.\"\nMr. Justice Pinard also referred to a passage from\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at 294:\n\" [13] The rule of practice is now well established that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify the exercise of the discretion to extend the time for service. In\nMay & Baker Canada Ltd.\n, cited above, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that a defendant trying to avoid service would constitute an obvious 'sufficient reason', and that there could be other sufficient reasons. But Chief Justice Jackett added (p. 404) that 'in my view, however, when the defendant was available for service and the plaintiff was not inhibited from serving or induced by the defendant not to serve, it is almost impossible to think of a \"sufficient reason\" for not serving within the time fixed for serving'. In that case, settlement negotiations were not considered as a sufficient reason.\n\" [14]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where the court specifically mentioned a number of exceptional circumstances which should justify a departure from the general rule to those mentioned in the\nBattersby\ncase ([1945] 1 K.B. 23) being: 1. the defendant has been avoiding service; 2. the defendant's address is unknown, as well as others not specified. Among these exceptional circumstances there would be, in summary form:\n1. an agreement between the parties, express or implied to defer service of the writ;\n2. where the delay to extend the validity of the writ has been induced, or contributed to, by words or conduct of the defendant or his representative, and\n3. where the defendant has evaded service or where for reasons without the plaintiff's fault, the writ could not have been served earlier even if the application had been made and granted earlier.\"",
    "[9]\nThese two cases,\nMay & Baker\nand <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and Mr. Justice Pinard's conclusion in the\nConnors Bros.\ncase are indicative of the other view, that inadvertence ought not to be a ground for an extension of time within which to serve a statement of claim.",
    "[10]\nOn the plain wording of rule 306 I need find only one sufficient reason in order to grant an extension. However, I must keep in mind that \"Allowing an extension of the delay to serve a statement of claim should be the exception and should not be easily granted:\nDuval Sales Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is not one of a failure to serve, for that was clearly accomplished as the client instructed. Rather, assuming Greer Shipping were charterer's agents and not owner's agents, it is both a failure to serve the correct agent and a failure to recognize that problem in a timely manner.",
    "[11] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[12]\nRule 310(2), which provides for substitutional service on someone out of the jurisdiction, without a court order, is an exceptional provision which has given rise to many interlocutory motions. It is a provision which demands strict compliance. Here, on the client's instructions, a wrong entity, Greer Shipping, was served in the apparently mistaken belief that it was an agent for the owners of the \"Imperial Confidence\". That may have been a mere slip, but at the time no damage had been done, for the Statement of Claim still had three and one half months of currency. Not to follow up, for example to request a defence, until nearly four months after the service on Greer Shipping had been effected, by which time the Statement of Claim had become stale-dated, goes beyond a mere slip. The analysis of Mr. Justice Joyal in the\nLaval Fortin\ncase, that of inadvertence and a mere slip in practice, does not assist the plaintiffs. It is not a sufficient reason that the plaintiffs felt they had served Welsen Shipping and needed to do nothing more.",
    "[13]\nI have considered whether Shipowners Assurance Management, by writing to counsel for the plaintiffs on February 15, 1995, to request a copy of the pleadings and by confirming, by letter of November 23, 1995, that the \"Imperial Confidence\" was entered with their client, the Newcastle P & I Club, might have mislead the plaintiffs. Those letters, while indicating that owners P & I Club and presumably also owners were aware of the proceedings and thus were not taken by any surprise, are neutral. They do not lead the plaintiffs to expect anything.",
    "[14]\nTime limitations are enacted to place a limit on the time that may go by before bringing a person into a lawsuit. From the material which has been filed, I cannot find any one sufficient reason or special circumstance which would justify the exercise of discretion to deprive the defendant of a statutory limitation. The motion is thus dismissed.\nMotion allowed in part.\nEditor: Jana A. Andersen/sg\n[End of document]"

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court acknowledged Rule 306 grants discretion to extend service time but emphasized extensions should be exceptional, not routine, citing *Duval Sales Corp.*",
      "The court distinguished the present case from *Laval Fortin*, where a 'slip in practice' justified an extension, finding the plaintiffs’ inaction went beyond a simple error; serving the wrong agent (Greer Shipping) and failing to follow up for over three months, allowing the claim to expire, was more than inadvertent.",
      "The court found the plaintiffs’ reliance on the defendant’s P&I Club’s awareness of the claim and requests for pleadings did not constitute a sufficient reason for extending the deadline, as those actions were neutral and did not mislead the plaintiffs into believing service was complete.",
      "The court applied the reasoning in *May & Baker* and *Connors Bros.*, which established that mere inadvertence or a failure to diarize are not 'sufficient reasons' for extending service time, especially when the defendant was available for service.",
      "The court determined that serving the incorrect party (Greer Shipping, charterer’s agent instead of the owner’s agent) coupled with a delayed follow-up constituted a failure to recognize and rectify a problem in a timely manner, exceeding the scope of a permissible 'slip'.",
      "The court underscored the importance of time limitations in litigation, stating they exist to ensure timely lawsuits and found no compelling reason to deprive the defendant of this statutory protection.",
      "The court interpreted Rule 310(2) regarding substitutional service as an exceptional provision requiring strict compliance, and the plaintiffs’ failure to adhere to this strictness contributed to the denial of the extension."
