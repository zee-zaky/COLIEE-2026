    "[1]\nReed, J.\n: The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia brings a motion to have the plaintiff's statement of claim struck out as against it on the grounds that: (1) the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action - refer: rule 419(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules; (2) the Federal Court has no jurisdiction over the action brought by the plaintiff against the College as a defendant.",
    "[2]\nThe plaintiff's action arose out of a notice issued by the Minister of National Health and Welfare pursuant to s. 58 of the Narcotic Control Regulations. For the purpose of these reasons, the Minister of National Health and Welfare and the Director of the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs will be referred to collectively as the \"Minister\" or sometimes as \"the Crown\".",
    "[3]\nUnder the Narcotic Control Regulations, a medical practitioner is allowed to prescribe narcotics to persons under his or her professional care when required for treatment:\n\"53 ...\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), a practitioner may administer, prescribe, give, sell or furnish a narcotic to a person ... if\n. . . . .\n(b) the narcotic is required for the condition for which the person ... is receiving treatment.\"\nPractitioners may also prescribe methadone (for the treatment of drug addiction) when an authorization is held from the Minister:\n\"68(1) Where he deems it to be in the public interest, or in the interests of science, the Minister may in writing authorize\n. . . . .\n(d) any practitioner to administer, prescribe, give, sell or furnish methadone to a person ... who is a patient under his professional treatment,\"",
    "[4]\nRegulation 58 authorizes the Minister to give notice to licensed dealers and pharmacists requiring them not to dispense medication with a narcotic content in response to prescriptions written by a particular practitioner. Such a notice can only be issued \"after consultation with the licensing authority of the province in which the practitioner is registered and entitled to practice\":\n\"58. The Minister\n. . . . .\n(b) may, ... after consultation with the licensing authority of the province in which the practitioner is registered and entitled to practice\ngive notice to licensed dealers and pharmacists ...\"",
    "[5]\nThe grounds on which such notice is given are set out in regulation 60 and one such ground is that the practitioner has violated s. 53 of the Regulations. A notice respecting the plaintiff was issued pursuant to this provision. The notice was sent because it was alleged the plaintiff was prescribing narcotics when not necessary for the treatment of the patient. The Minister subsequently also revoked the plaintiff's authorization to prescribe methadone.",
    "[6]\nThe plaintiff's statement of claim attacks the validity of the Minister's actions on several grounds; two of them are that the notice is: (1) invalid for having been issued without due regard to the principles of natural justice or fairness; (2) invalid for having been made on unreasonable grounds. The plaintiff alleges: that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia made negligent or false representations to the Minister; that it made such representations \"in bad faith and so as to intentionally interfere with the ability and right of the plaintiff to carry on his chosen profession\"; that \"the College and the Minister have conspired to interfere with the ability and right of the plaintiff to carry on his chosen profession\" (paragraph 12 of the statement of claim).",
    "[7]\nThe plaintiff seeks: a declaration, certiorari, mandamus, an interim injunction, a permanent injunction, an order that the information on which the Minister and the College acted be made available to him, an order that the Minister provide him with a full hearing and the right to cross-examine, and general and special damages (paragraph 13 of the statement of claim).\nDisclosure of Information on which\nMinister and College Acted",
    "[8]\nCounsel for the College argues that the claim for disclosure of the information on which the Minister and the College acted is not supported by any statutory, contractual or other allegation and, therefore, establishes no cause of action and should be struck out. I think this aspect of the plaintiff's claim cannot be said to be so obviously insupportable that it should be struck out at this stage. The plaintiff alleges a lack of natural justice - that he has not been given the opportunity to meet the case against him. Mr. Justice Dubé found that a prima facie case to this effect existed and granted an interim order setting aside the s. 58 notice. [See 6 F.T.R. 83]. The final relief sought by the plaintiff is framed in a number of alternate remedies, among which are: the permanent quashing of the s. 58 notice; an opportunity to meet the case against him. The relief claimed, in paragraph 13(g) of the statement of claim seeking full disclosure of information is clearly linked to these claims, and specifically to his claim that he have an opportunity to meet the case against him. I do not think the challenged part of the statement of claim is so disconnected from the cause of action in general and from the other headings of relief sought that it should be struck out.",
    "[9]\nQuite apart from any specific claim in the statement of claim, the plaintiff could require such disclosure from the Minister as part of the discovery proceedings. Such could also be obtained from the College as long as the College is a party to the action. If the College were not a party, then, although the discovery of documents might still be had from it pursuant to rule 464 of the Federal Court Rules discovery in its broader sense would not be available. It is of course the object of the present proceedings to have the College struck out as a party on the ground that the Federal Court's jurisdiction does not extend to cover it. More will be said with respect to this issue later.\nClaim Respecting Conspiracy",
    "[10]\nCounsel for the College argues that the plaintiff's claim respecting conspiracy should be struck out. It is his contention that insufficient facts are pleaded in the statement of claim to support such a claim. Specifically, it is said no facts are pleaded as to an agreement or joint action having been carried out by the two defendants (The Minister and the College). I think the pleading is clearly deficient. See: Bullen and Leake and Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings (12th Ed.), p. 341;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Sup. Ct.). The last section of paragraph 12 of the statement of claim (the allegation of conspiracy) will be struck out with leave to the plaintiff to amend that claim and plead more specifically with respect thereto.\nJurisdiction - the Defendant College",
    "[11]\nThis leaves for consideration the argument whether there is any jurisdiction at all in this court to entertain the plaintiff's claim against the defendant, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. There has not developed in our jurisprudence the concepts of pendant and ancillary jurisdiction which have been used in the United States to protect litigants from the inefficiencies and costs involved in having to split actions between federal and state courts. In that jurisdiction it seems fairly clear that a claim such as that brought by the plaintiff could proceed as against both defendants in one court. However, the situation is more restrained in our jurisprudence.",
    "[12]\nThe jurisdictional argument before me focussed on the decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the Marshall case it was found that on the facts of that case, jurisdiction existed in the Federal Court to entertain a plaintiff's claim, not only against the Crown as employer, but also against the Public Service Alliance, the plaintiff's union. Counsel for the College argues that: (1) the decision in the Marshall case is not good law, or at the best it is too broadly stated; and (2) in any event, the facts in this case do not bring it within the parameters of the Marshall decision.",
    "[13]\nCounsel quickly recognized that the first argument was not likely to be an easy one to pursue before me. The decision in the Marshall case was not appealed but there was at the time this motion was heard an appeal filed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [See 5 F.T.R. 13]. I decided, and advised counsel that, I would reserve judgment on this motion pending the outcome of that appeal. The status quo between the parties is presently being preserved by the interim injunction order of Mr. Justice Dubé and I could see little prejudice to either party in the delay thus imposed. It was clear that a Court of Appeal decision on this issue was likely to be rendered in the early part of 1987. In any event not only has the Federal Court of Appeal decision in the Roberts case now been rendered (March 2, 1987) [see 73 N.R. 234] but the relevant issue has also been addressed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[14]\nCounsel were asked and have presented written argument on this recent jurisprudence. The starting point is then  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  exist: (1) there must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament; (2) there must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction; (3) the law on which the case is based must be \"a law of Canada\" as that phrase is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. In the Marshall case the first and second categories referred to in Miidas were described as (1) a requirement that statutory jurisdiction exist and (2) a requirement that constitutional jurisdiction exist (this last being labelled as such because s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867 was seen as having been interpreted to require existing and applicable federal law). The third requirement in the Miidas case, that the federal law on which the case is based must be constitutionally valid as within Parliament's legislative jurisdiction pursuant to s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, was not referred to as such in the Marshall case, although the legislation there in question, the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C. 1966-67, c. 71 as amended and the Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1966-67, c. 72 as amended clearly met that test. In this case the constitutional validity of the underlying federal law, the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1960-61, c. 35 as amended, is clearly established: refer  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Thus there is no need in the context of this case to consider further the third requirement of the Miidas decision. It is clearly met.\ni) existing and applicable federal law",
    "[15]\nI will turn first to the requirement that there must be existing and applicable federal law which operates as an underpinning for the court's jurisdiction (the second requirement of Miidas). The defendant College claims that the test of jurisdiction which must be applied is that set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . That is that one must ask whether:\n\"... this Court would have jurisdiction if the claim advanced against one particular defendant stood alone and were not joined in an action against other defendants over whom there properly was jurisdiction.\"\nThat may well be the correct test in cases such as Anglophoto and Desbiens or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , when there is no federal statutory underpinnings or shelter on which to ground the claim, for example when the claim is purely one of contract or tort based on provincial law. But, my understanding of the Miidas case, the Rhine; Prytula case, infra, and Bensol case, infra, as well as those such as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is that a prior or slightly different question must be asked.",
    "[16]\nPrior to the more recent jurisprudence some indication of what is required to fulfill the test that there be existing and applicable federal law was found in the Supreme Court decisions in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 363 that in order to have jurisdiction:\n\"It is\nnot enough that the liability arises in consequence of a [federal] statute.\n\"In the present instance while the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act authorizes the making of advances and prescribes the conditions on which these advances may be made by the Board as an agency of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada,\nit does not, in itself, impose a liability\nand there is no liability except that undertaken by the borrower which liability flows not from the statute but from the borrower's contractual promise to repay ...\" (underlining added)\nThe Supreme Court found this to be too stringent a requirement. Chief Justice Laskin, at pages 446-447 said:\n\"... it is contended that there is simply the enforcement of an ordinary contractual obligation which owes nothing to federal law other than its origin in the statutory authorization to make the advance.\n\"... True,\nthere is an undertaking or a contractual consequence\nof the application of the Act [Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act]\nbut that does not mean that the Act is left behind\nonce the undertaking or contract is made.\nAt every turn\n, the\nAct has its impact on the undertaking so as to make it proper to say that there is here existing and valid federal\nlaw to govern the transaction which became the subject of litigation in the Federal Court. It should hardly be necessary to add that 'contract' or other legal institutions, such as 'tort' cannot be invariably attributed to sole provincial legislative regulation or be deemed to be, as common law, solely matters of provincial law.\n\"In the McNamara case, there was no such statutory shelter within which the transactions there were contained as there is in the present case ...\" (Underlining added)",
    "[17]\nAnother articulation of the required test was set out by Mr. Justice LeDain in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). He referred to the requirement as follows:\n\"... It should be sufficient in my opinion if the rights and obligations of the parties are to be determined\nto some material extent by federal law\n. It should not be necessary that the cause of action be one that is created by federal law so long as it is one affected by it.\" (underlining added)",
    "[18]\nThe Supreme Court expressed this requirement in the Miidas case in the following terms (at pages 774-775):\n\"... It is important, therefore, to establish that the subject matter under consideration in any case is so integrally connected to maritime matters ...\n\"... the stevedoring function 'is an integral part of carrying on the activity of shipping,' ...\n. . . . .\n\"It is clear, in my view, that such incidental storage by the carrier itself or by a third party under contract to the carrier is also a matter of maritime concern by virtue of the 'close, practical relationship of the terminal operation to the performance of the contract of carriage' ...\"",
    "[19]\nThus in my view the question becomes whether the plaintiff's claims in negligence and conspiracy against the defendant College can be said \"to be determined to some material extent\" by federal law - the test Mr. Justice LeDain described in the Bensol case; or fall within a federal \"statutory shelter\" in the sense that that concept is used in the Rhine; Prytula cases, or to be \"so integrally connected\" or have a \"close, practical relationship to\" the federal matter in issue as those phrases are used in the Miidas case.",
    "[20]\nOn this point the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  arrest and imprisonment against Her Majesty the Queen, the National Parole Board and various individuals. The claim arose out of a practice called gating which the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional. That practice involved the release and immediate rearrest of a penitentiary inmate. A motion to strike out the action against the individuals was brought on the ground that that action was outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. It was argued that the right to bring a claim for false arrest or false imprisonment was not one created by federal law. The Federal Court of Appeal stated at pages eight and ten of its decision [see pp. 154 and 156 (N.R.)]:\n\"The source of the freedom being enjoyed by him [the plaintiff] at the time of his alleged false arrest and imprisonment is found in federal law. The relevant statutory provisions are subsection 24(1) of the Penitentiary Act, and subsection 10(1), section 12 and subsections 15(1) and (2) of the Parole Act ...\n\"If the torts of false arrest and imprisonment were committed as alleged, they were committed because his [the plaintiff's] right to freedom thus delineated [by the National Parole Act and the Penitentiaries Act] was interfered with. I do not think that law need expressly provide a remedy for such interference for the claims to be governed by it. The torts, in my view, depend for their existence upon federal law.\"",
    "[21]\nThis is obviously directly analogous to the situation in the present case. The requirement in the Narcotic Control Regulations (number 58) that the Minister consult with the licensing authority in the province before refusing to license a practitioner to prescribe narcotics, or methadone, is the underpinning of the claim against the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. The claim against the defendant College is not made merely because the Crown is already a party to a contract or tort claim based solely on provincial law. The advice given by the College to the Minister pursuant to s. 58 is the very essence of the plaintiff's claim. The Minister must consult with the provincial licensing body before issuing a s. 58 notice. The advice given is obviously crucial perhaps determinative of any decision the Minister ultimately makes. Thus, the statutory shelter, or the integral relationship, or the close practical relationship of the claim against the College with the Narcotic Control Act exists. In the words of the Oag decision the opportunity for the cause of action to arise as between the plaintiff and the defendant College was created by federal law - by the Narcotic Control Regulations.\nii) statutory jurisdiction",
    "[22]\nThis leaves for consideration the question of whether there is a statutory grant of authority allowing the Federal Court to deal with a claim such as that in issue in this case. If the reasoning in the Marshall case is sound such a grant can be found in s. 17(1) of the Federal Court Act. The soundness of such reasoning was left open by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the Roberts case, supra. I quote the relevant passages from the Marshall decision, supra, at pp. 447-449:\n\"The question, then, is whether subsection 17(1) confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court so as to allow a plaintiff to sue both the Crown and a subject in that Court when the cause of action against both of them is one that is as intertwined as is the case here (e.g.: with respect to the alleged collusion). On a plain reading of the section, such jurisdiction would appear to have been intended since the grant given is over cases where relief is claimed against the Crown\". The jurisdiction is not merely over 'claims against the Crown', as a narrower interpretation would seem to require.\n\"That Parliament intended the broader scope not only would seem to follow from the literal wording of the section but it is also a reasonable inference from the fact that certain claims against the federal Crown are to be brought exclusively in the Federal Court. It seems unlikely that Parliament would have intended to disadvantage persons, in the position of the plaintiff, by requiring them to split a unified cause of action and bring part of it in the Federal Court and part in the superior courts of the provinces. The effect of such an intention would be to subject a plaintiff, in a position similar to the plaintiff in this case, to different and possibly contradictory findings in different courts, and to place jurisdictional and cost impediments in the path of such persons if they sue the federal Crown. I do not think that such was the intention of Parliament. While there is no doubt that the jurisdiction of statutory courts are strictly interpreted in that they are not courts of inherent jurisdiction, it is well to remember that section 11 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, requires that all federal statutes be interpreted with such a construction as best to ensure the attainment of their purpose. This would seem to require that subsection 17(1) be interpreted as conferring on the Federal Court jurisdiction over the whole case, in a situation such as the present, where the plaintiff's claim is against both the employer (the Crown), and the Union (the P.S.A.).\n\"Also, I would note that the scope which in my view subsection 17(1) bears would not accord the Federal Court any jurisdiction over cases between subject and subject, solely on the ground that a federal claim might potentially be present but is not being pursued. Without a claim being made directly against the Crown there would be no foundation for Federal Court jurisdiction, exclusive or concurrent, pursuant to subsection 17(1). But when such a claim against the federal Crown is made, in my view subsection 17(1) is broadly enough drafted to allow a co-defendant, in a case such as the present, to be sued along with the Crown ... In the present case the claim against the Crown (employer) and the Public Service Alliance (Union) are so intertwined that findings of fact with respect to one defendant are intimately bound up with those that would have to be made with respect to the other.\"",
    "[23]\nCounsel for the defendant College argues that the plaintiff's claim against the Crown in this case and that against the College are not intimately intertwined because one is an attack on the validity of the s. 58 notice on administrative law grounds and the other is a tort claim in negligence and conspiracy. It is argued that the two claims are expressly alternative, i.e. if the plaintiff succeeds against the Crown, he has no claim against the College. It is argued that there is no particular inconvenience to the plaintiff in being required to pursue the two defendants in separate causes of action in different courts.",
    "[24]\nI do not agree. If the plaintiff's claims respecting negligence and conspiracy are substantiated, the attack on the s. 58 notice is quite likely to be sustainable also. If the claims against the College can be substantiated there is probably an argument that the Minister's decision was based on findings of fact made in a perverse and capricious manner, or based on irrelevant considerations - these being valid grounds for challenging the Ministerial decision on an administrative law basis. The two causes of action are not alternative and mutually exclusive; they are intimately intertwined. Also, if the conspiracy claim cannot be brought against both defendants in the Federal Court, the plaintiff will have to sue the Crown in the Federal Court for conspiring with the College, and sue the College in the superior court of the province for conspiring with the Crown, its servants and agents. Thus there is potential for duplication and conflicting findings of fact, burdens in cost both for the parties and the courts.",
    "[25]\nIn addition, it is only appropriate to strike out a statement of claim where it is beyond all doubt that no cause of action exists as against the party in question. I am not convinced that the test is met in this case. In my view there is a very strong argument that the Federal Court's jurisdiction extends to allow it to deal with the claim against the College in the context of the claim against the Minister in this case. Accordingly, the College's motion to have the plaintiff's claim struck out as against it will be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Debra F. MacCausland/blk\n[End of document]"

It is clearly met.\ni) existing and applicable federal law\n[15]\nI will turn first to the requirement that there must be existing and applicable federal law which operates as an underpinning for the court's jurisdiction (the second requirement of Miidas). The defendant College claims that the test of jurisdiction which must be applied is that set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . That is that one must ask whether:\n\"... this Court would have jurisdiction if the claim advanced against one particular defendant stood alone and were not joined in an action against other defendants over whom there properly was jurisdiction.\"\nThat may well be the correct test in cases such as Anglophoto and Desbiens or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , when there is no federal statutory underpinnings or shelter on which to ground the claim, for example when the claim is purely one of contract or tort based on provincial law. But, my understanding of the Miidas case, the Rhine; Prytula case, infra, and Bensol case, infra, as well as those such as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is that a prior or slightly different question must be asked.\n[16]\nPrior to the more recent jurisprudence some indication of what is required to fulfill the test that there be existing and applicable federal law was found in the Supreme Court decisions in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 363 that in order to have jurisdiction:\n\"It is\nnot enough that the liability arises in consequence of a [federal] statute.\n\"In the present instance while the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act authorizes the making of advances and prescribes the conditions on which these advances may be made by the Board as an agency of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada,\nit does not, in itself, impose a liability\nand there is no liability except that undertaken by the borrower which liability flows not from the statute but from the borrower's contractual promise to repay ...\" (underlining added)\nThe Supreme Court found this to be too stringent a requirement. Chief Justice Laskin, at pages 446-447 said:\n\"... it is contended that there is simply the enforcement of an ordinary contractual obligation which owes nothing to federal law other than its origin in the statutory authorization to make the advance.\n\"... True,\nthere is an undertaking or a contractual consequence\nof the application of the Act [Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act]\nbut that does not mean that the Act is left behind\nonce the undertaking or contract is made.\nAt every turn\n, the\nAct has its impact on the undertaking so as to make it proper to say that there is here existing and valid federal\nlaw to govern the transaction which became the subject of litigation in the Federal Court. It should hardly be necessary to add that 'contract' or other legal institutions, such as 'tort' cannot be invariably attributed to sole provincial legislative regulation or be deemed to be, as common law, solely matters of provincial law.\n\"In the McNamara case, there was no such statutory shelter within which the transactions there were contained as there is in the present case ...\" (Underlining added)\n[17]\nAnother articulation of the required test was set out by Mr. Justice LeDain in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.). He referred to the requirement as follows:\n\"... It should be sufficient in my opinion if the rights and obligations of the parties are to be determined\nto some material extent by federal law\n. It should not be necessary that the cause of action be one that is created by federal law so long as it is one affected by it.\" (underlining added)\n[18]\nThe Supreme Court expressed this requirement in the Miidas case in the following terms (at pages 774-775):\n\"... It is important, therefore, to establish that the subject matter under consideration in any case is so integrally connected to maritime matters ...\n\"... the stevedoring function 'is an integral part of carrying on the activity of shipping,' ...\n. . . . .\n\"It is clear, in my view, that such incidental storage by the carrier itself or by a third party under contract to the carrier is also a matter of maritime concern by virtue of the 'close, practical relationship of the terminal operation to the performance of the contract of carriage' ...\"\n[19]\nThus in my view the question becomes whether the plaintiff's claims in negligence and conspiracy against the defendant College can be said \"to be determined to some material extent\" by federal law - the test Mr. Justice LeDain described in the Bensol case; or fall within a federal \"statutory shelter\" in the sense that that concept is used in the Rhine; Prytula cases, or to be \"so integrally connected\" or have a \"close, practical relationship to\" the federal matter in issue as those phrases are used in the Miidas case.\n[20]\nOn this point the recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  arrest and imprisonment against Her Majesty the Queen, the National Parole Board and various individuals. The claim arose out of a practice called gating which the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional. That practice involved the release and immediate rearrest of a penitentiary inmate. A motion to strike out the action against the individuals was brought on the ground that that action was outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. It was argued that the right to bring a claim for false arrest or false imprisonment was not one created by federal law. The Federal Court of Appeal stated at pages eight and ten of its decision [see pp. 154 and 156 (N.R.)]:\n\"The source of the freedom being enjoyed by him [the plaintiff] at the time of his alleged false arrest and imprisonment is found in federal law. The relevant statutory provisions are subsection 24(1) of the Penitentiary Act, and subsection 10(1), section 12 and subsections 15(1) and (2) of the Parole Act ...\n\"If the torts of false arrest and imprisonment were committed as alleged, they were committed because his [the plaintiff's] right to freedom thus delineated [by the National Parole Act and the Penitentiaries Act] was interfered with. I do not think that law need expressly provide a remedy for such interference for the claims to be governed by it. The torts, in my view, depend for their existence upon federal law.\"\n[21]\nThis is obviously directly analogous to the situation in the present case. The requirement in the Narcotic Control Regulations (number 58) that the Minister consult with the licensing authority in the province before refusing to license a practitioner to prescribe narcotics, or methadone, is the underpinning of the claim against the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. The claim against the defendant College is not made merely because the Crown is already a party to a contract or tort claim based solely on provincial law. The advice given by the College to the Minister pursuant to s. 58 is the very essence of the plaintiff's claim. The Minister must consult with the provincial licensing body before issuing a s. 58 notice. The advice given is obviously crucial perhaps determinative of any decision the Minister ultimately makes. Thus, the statutory shelter, or the integral relationship, or the close practical relationship of the claim against the College with the Narcotic Control Act exists. In the words of the Oag decision the opportunity for the cause of action to arise as between the plaintiff and the defendant College was created by federal law - by the Narcotic Control Regulations.\nii) statutory jurisdiction\n[22]\nThis leaves for consideration the question of whether there is a statutory grant of authority allowing the Federal Court to deal with a claim such as that in issue in this case. If the reasoning in the Marshall case is sound such a grant can be found in s. 17(1) of the Federal Court Act. The soundness of such reasoning was left open by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the Roberts case, supra. I quote the relevant passages from the Marshall decision, supra, at pp. 447-449:\n\"The question, then, is whether subsection 17(1) confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court so as to allow a plaintiff to sue both the Crown and a subject in that Court when the cause of action against both of them is one that is as intertwined as is the case here (e.g.: with respect to the alleged collusion). On a plain reading of the section, such jurisdiction would appear to have been intended since the grant given is over cases where relief is claimed against the Crown\". The jurisdiction is not merely over 'claims against the Crown', as a narrower interpretation would seem to require.\n\"That Parliament intended the broader scope not only would seem to follow from the literal wording of the section but it is also a reasonable inference from the fact that certain claims against the federal Crown are to be brought exclusively in the Federal Court. It seems unlikely that Parliament would have intended to disadvantage persons, in the position of the plaintiff, by requiring them to split a unified cause of action and bring part of it in the Federal Court and part in the superior courts of the provinces. The effect of such an intention would be to subject a plaintiff, in a position similar to the plaintiff in this case, to different and possibly contradictory findings in different courts, and to place jurisdictional and cost impediments in the path of such persons if they sue the federal Crown. I do not think that such was the intention of Parliament. While there is no doubt that the jurisdiction of statutory courts are strictly interpreted in that they are not courts of inherent jurisdiction, it is well to remember that section 11 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, requires that all federal statutes be interpreted with such a construction as best to ensure the attainment of their purpose. This would seem to require that subsection 17(1) be interpreted as conferring on the Federal Court jurisdiction over the whole case, in a situation such as the present, where the plaintiff's claim is against both the employer (the Crown), and the Union (the P.S.A.).\n\"Also, I would note that the scope which in my view subsection 17(1) bears would not accord the Federal Court any jurisdiction over cases between subject and subject, solely on the ground that a federal claim might potentially be present but is not being pursued. Without a claim being made directly against the Crown there would be no foundation for Federal Court jurisdiction, exclusive or concurrent, pursuant to subsection 17(1). But when such a claim against the federal Crown is made, in my view subsection 17(1) is broadly enough drafted to allow a co-defendant, in a case such as the present, to be sued along with the Crown ... In the present case the claim against the Crown (employer) and the Public Service Alliance (Union) are so intertwined that findings of fact with respect to one defendant are intimately bound up with those that would have to be made with respect to the other.\"\n[23]\nCounsel for the defendant College argues that the plaintiff's claim against the Crown in this case and that against the College are not intimately intertwined because one is an attack on the validity of the s. 58 notice on administrative law grounds and the other is a tort claim in negligence and conspiracy. It is argued that the two claims are expressly alternative, i.e. if the plaintiff succeeds against the Crown, he has no claim against the College. It is argued that there is no particular inconvenience to the plaintiff in being required to pursue the two defendants in separate causes of action in different courts.\n[24]\nI do not agree. If the plaintiff's claims respecting negligence and conspiracy are substantiated, the attack on the s. 58 notice is quite likely to be sustainable also. If the claims against the College can be substantiated there is probably an argument that the Minister's decision was based on findings of fact made in a perverse and capricious manner, or based on irrelevant considerations - these being valid grounds for challenging the Ministerial decision on an administrative law basis. The two causes of action are not alternative and mutually exclusive; they are intimately intertwined. Also, if the conspiracy claim cannot be brought against both defendants in the Federal Court, the plaintiff will have to sue the Crown in the Federal Court for conspiring with the College, and sue the College in the superior court of the province for conspiring with the Crown, its servants and agents. Thus there is potential for duplication and conflicting findings of fact, burdens in cost both for the parties and the courts.\n[25]\nIn addition, it is only appropriate to strike out a statement of claim where it is beyond all doubt that no cause of action exists as against the party in question. I am not convinced that the test is met in this case. In my view there is a very strong argument that the Federal Court's jurisdiction extends to allow it to deal with the claim against the College in the context of the claim against the Minister in this case. Accordingly, the College's motion to have the plaintiff's claim struck out as against it will be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Debra F. MacCausland/blk\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nReed, J.\n: The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia brings a motion to have the plaintiff's statement of claim struck out as against it on the grounds that: (1) the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action - refer: rule 419(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules; (2) the Federal Court has no jurisdiction over the action brought by the plaintiff against the College as a defendant.\n\n[2]\nThe plaintiff's action arose out of a notice issued by the Minister of National Health and Welfare pursuant to s. 58 of the Narcotic Control Regulations. For the purpose of these reasons, the Minister of National Health and Welfare and the Director of the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs will be referred to collectively as the \"Minister\" or sometimes as \"the Crown\".\n\n[3]\nUnder the Narcotic Control Regulations, a medical practitioner is allowed to prescribe narcotics to persons under his or her professional care when required for treatment:\n\"53 ...\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), a practitioner may administer, prescribe, give, sell or furnish a narcotic to a person ... if\n. . . . .\n(b) the narcotic is required for the condition for which the person ... is receiving treatment.\"\nPractitioners may also prescribe methadone (for the treatment of drug addiction) when an authorization is held from the Minister:\n\"68(1) Where he deems it to be in the public interest, or in the interests of science, the Minister may in writing authorize\n. . . . .\n(d) any practitioner to administer, prescribe, give, sell or furnish methadone to a person ... who is a patient under his professional treatment,\"\n\n[4]\nRegulation 58 authorizes the Minister to give notice to licensed dealers and pharmacists requiring them not to dispense medication with a narcotic content in response to prescriptions written by a particular practitioner. Such a notice can only be issued \"after consultation with the licensing authority of the province in which the practitioner is registered and entitled to practice\":\n\"58. The Minister\n. . . . .\n(b) may, ... after consultation with the licensing authority of the province in which the practitioner is registered and entitled to practice\ngive notice to licensed dealers and pharmacists ...\"\n\n[5]\nThe grounds on which such notice is given are set out in regulation 60 and one such ground is that the practitioner has violated s. 53 of the Regulations. A notice respecting the plaintiff was issued pursuant to this provision. The notice was sent because it was alleged the plaintiff was prescribing narcotics when not necessary for the treatment of the patient. The Minister subsequently also revoked the plaintiff's authorization to prescribe methadone.\n\n[6]\nThe plaintiff's statement of claim attacks the validity of the Minister's actions on several grounds; two of them are that the notice is: (1) invalid for having been issued without due regard to the principles of natural justice or fairness; (2) invalid for having been made on unreasonable grounds. The plaintiff alleges: that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia made negligent or false representations to the Minister; that it made such representations \"in bad faith and so as to intentionally interfere with the ability and right of the plaintiff to carry on his chosen profession\"; that \"the College and the Minister have conspired to interfere with the ability and right of the plaintiff to carry on his chosen profession\" (paragraph 12 of the statement of claim).\n\n[7]\nThe plaintiff seeks: a declaration, certiorari, mandamus, an interim injunction, a permanent injunction, an order that the information on which the Minister and the College acted be made available to him, an order that the Minister provide him with a full hearing and the right to cross-examine, and general and special damages (paragraph 13 of the statement of claim).\nDisclosure of Information on which\nMinister and College Acted\n\n[8]\nCounsel for the College argues that the claim for disclosure of the information on which the Minister and the College acted is not supported by any statutory, contractual or other allegation and, therefore, establishes no cause of action and should be struck out. I think this aspect of the plaintiff's claim cannot be said to be so obviously insupportable that it should be struck out at this stage. The plaintiff alleges a lack of natural justice - that he has not been given the opportunity to meet the case against him. Mr. Justice Dubé found that a prima facie case to this effect existed and granted an interim order setting aside the s. 58 notice. [See 6 F.T.R. 83]. The final relief sought by the plaintiff is framed in a number of alternate remedies, among which are: the permanent quashing of the s. 58 notice; an opportunity to meet the case against him. The relief claimed, in paragraph 13(g) of the statement of claim seeking full disclosure of information is clearly linked to these claims, and specifically to his claim that he have an opportunity to meet the case against him. I do not think the challenged part of the statement of claim is so disconnected from the cause of action in general and from the other headings of relief sought that it should be struck out.\n\n[9]\nQuite apart from any specific claim in the statement of claim, the plaintiff could require such disclosure from the Minister as part of the discovery proceedings. Such could also be obtained from the College as long as the College is a party to the action. If the College were not a party, then, although the discovery of documents might still be had from it pursuant to rule 464 of the Federal Court Rules discovery in its broader sense would not be available. It is of course the object of the present proceedings to have the College struck out as a party on the ground that the Federal Court's jurisdiction does not extend to cover it. More will be said with respect to this issue later.\nClaim Respecting Conspiracy\n\n[10]\nCounsel for the College argues that the plaintiff's claim respecting conspiracy should be struck out. It is his contention that insufficient facts are pleaded in the statement of claim to support such a claim. Specifically, it is said no facts are pleaded as to an agreement or joint action having been carried out by the two defendants (The Minister and the College). I think the pleading is clearly deficient. See: Bullen and Leake and Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings (12th Ed.), p. 341;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Sup. Ct.). The last section of paragraph 12 of the statement of claim (the allegation of conspiracy) will be struck out with leave to the plaintiff to amend that claim and plead more specifically with respect thereto.\nJurisdiction - the Defendant College\n\n[11]\nThis leaves for consideration the argument whether there is any jurisdiction at all in this court to entertain the plaintiff's claim against the defendant, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. There has not developed in our jurisprudence the concepts of pendant and ancillary jurisdiction which have been used in the United States to protect litigants from the inefficiencies and costs involved in having to split actions between federal and state courts. In that jurisdiction it seems fairly clear that a claim such as that brought by the plaintiff could proceed as against both defendants in one court. However, the situation is more restrained in our jurisprudence.\n\n[12]\nThe jurisdictional argument before me focussed on the decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In the Marshall case it was found that on the facts of that case, jurisdiction existed in the Federal Court to entertain a plaintiff's claim, not only against the Crown as employer, but also against the Public Service Alliance, the plaintiff's union. Counsel for the College argues that: (1) the decision in the Marshall case is not good law, or at the best it is too broadly stated; and (2) in any event, the facts in this case do not bring it within the parameters of the Marshall decision.\n\n[13]\nCounsel quickly recognized that the first argument was not likely to be an easy one to pursue before me. The decision in the Marshall case was not appealed but there was at the time this motion was heard an appeal filed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [See 5 F.T.R. 13]. I decided, and advised counsel that, I would reserve judgment on this motion pending the outcome of that appeal. The status quo between the parties is presently being preserved by the interim injunction order of Mr. Justice Dubé and I could see little prejudice to either party in the delay thus imposed. It was clear that a Court of Appeal decision on this issue was likely to be rendered in the early part of 1987. In any event not only has the Federal Court of Appeal decision in the Roberts case now been rendered (March 2, 1987) [see 73 N.R. 234] but the relevant issue has also been addressed in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[14]\nCounsel were asked and have presented written argument on this recent jurisprudence. The starting point is then  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  exist: (1) there must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament; (2) there must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction; (3) the law on which the case is based must be \"a law of Canada\" as that phrase is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867. In the Marshall case the first and second categories referred to in Miidas were described as (1) a requirement that statutory jurisdiction exist and (2) a requirement that constitutional jurisdiction exist (this last being labelled as such because s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867 was seen as having been interpreted to require existing and applicable federal law). The third requirement in the Miidas case, that the federal law on which the case is based must be constitutionally valid as within Parliament's legislative jurisdiction pursuant to s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, was not referred to as such in the Marshall case, although the legislation there in question, the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C. 1966-67, c. 71 as amended and the Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1966-67, c. 72 as amended clearly met that test. In this case the constitutional validity of the underlying federal law, the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1960-61, c. 35 as amended, is clearly established: refer  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Thus there is no need in the context of this case to consider further the third requirement of the Miidas decision. It is clearly met.\ni) existing and applicable federal law\n\n[15]\nI will turn first to the requirement that there must be existing and applicable federal law which operates as an underpinning for the court's jurisdiction (the second requirement of Miidas). The defendant College claims that the test of jurisdiction which must be applied is that set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . That is that one must ask whether:\n\"... this Court would have jurisdiction if the claim advanced against one particular defendant stood alone and were not joined in an action against other defendants over whom there properly was jurisdiction.\"\nThat may well be the correct test in cases such as Anglophoto and Desbiens or  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , when there is no federal statutory underpinnings or shelter on which to ground the claim, for example when the claim is purely one of contract or tort based on provincial law. But, my understanding of the Miidas case, the Rhine; Prytula case, infra, and Bensol case, infra, as well as those such as  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is that a prior or slightly different question must be asked.\n\n[16]\nPrior to the more recent jurisprudence some indication of what is required to fulfill the test that there be existing and applicable federal law was found in the Supreme Court decisions in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 363 that in order to have jurisdiction:\n\"It is\nnot enough that the liability arises in consequence of a [federal] statute.\n\"In the present instance while the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act authorizes the making of advances and prescribes the conditions on which these advances may be made by the Board as an agency of Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada,\nit does not, in itself, impose a liability\nand there is no liability except that undertaken by the borrower which liability flows not from the statute but from the borrower's contractual promise to repay ...\" (underlining added)\nThe Supreme Court found this to be too stringent a requirement.

Thus there is potential for duplication and conflicting findings of fact, burdens in cost both for the parties and the courts.\n\n[25]\nIn addition, it is only appropriate to strike out a statement of claim where it is beyond all doubt that no cause of action exists as against the party in question. I am not convinced that the test is met in this case. In my view there is a very strong argument that the Federal Court's jurisdiction extends to allow it to deal with the claim against the College in the context of the claim against the Minister in this case. Accordingly, the College's motion to have the plaintiff's claim struck out as against it will be dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Debra F. MacCausland/blk\n[End of document]",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court addressed the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia’s motion to strike the plaintiff’s claim against it, focusing on two grounds: lack of a reasonable cause of action and lack of Federal Court jurisdiction.",
      "Regarding the claim for disclosure of information, the court found it wasn’t so obviously unsupported as to warrant striking it out at this stage, as it was linked to the plaintiff’s claim of denied natural justice and the desire to understand the basis of the Minister’s actions. The court noted the plaintiff could pursue this disclosure during discovery proceedings.",
      "The court struck out the plaintiff’s conspiracy claim due to insufficient pleaded facts, granting leave to amend and provide more specific details.",
      "The central issue was whether the Federal Court had jurisdiction over the claim against the College. The court applied the principles established in *Miidas* and subsequent cases, requiring a statutory grant of jurisdiction, an existing body of federal law essential to the case, and that the law be a 'law of Canada' under the Constitution Act.",
      "The court determined the Narcotic Control Act provided the necessary federal law underpinning, finding a sufficient connection between the plaintiff’s claims against the College and the federal regulatory scheme. Specifically, the Minister’s requirement to consult with the provincial licensing authority (the College) before issuing a notice under s. 58 created a link sufficient to establish jurisdiction.",
      "The court distinguished this case from those involving purely provincial law claims, emphasizing that the plaintiff’s claim against the College arose directly from the College’s advice to the Minister under the federal regulations. The court relied on the *Oag* decision, finding the opportunity for the cause of action against the College was created by federal law.",
      "The court interpreted s. 17(1) of the Federal Court Act broadly, finding it authorized the Federal Court to hear claims against both the Crown and a co-defendant when the claims were intertwined, preventing the need to split the action between courts and potentially receive conflicting findings. The court found the claims against the Crown and the College were not alternative but rather interconnected, as proving negligence or conspiracy against the College could undermine the validity of the Minister’s decision.",
      "The court ultimately dismissed the College’s motion, concluding that the Federal Court did have jurisdiction over the claim against it and that there was a reasonable argument for a cause of action, not meeting the high threshold for striking a claim."
