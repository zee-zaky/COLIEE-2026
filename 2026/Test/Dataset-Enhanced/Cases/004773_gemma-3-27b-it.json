    "[1]\nNoël, J.\n: This is an application by Modupe Ganiyat Idowu Ajeigbe [the Applicant] for a judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of the decision of a Visa officer of the Immigration Section of the High Commission in Lagos refusing the Applicant's application for a temporary resident visa [the visa].\nII.\nAlleged Facts",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant is from the City of Alakulo, Lagos, Nigeria.",
    "[3]\nIn 2007, her ex-husband submitted an application for a permanent visa as a member of the family class, which was refused in 2009. The application was dismissed pursuant to subsection 4(1) and paragraph 117(9)(\nd\n) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227, whereby the officer was of the opinion that the relationship with the husband never ceased.",
    "[4]\nOn or about June 3, 2014, the Applicant claimed to have been invited by her three Canadian children to come and visit them in Canada from December 15, 2014 to January 14, 2015. She applied for a temporary resident visa. This visa was denied on September 8, 2014. This is the decision under review.\nIII.\nImpugned Decision",
    "[5]\nThe Visa officer refused the visa because the Applicant did not meet the requirements for it. The Visa officer was not satisfied that the Applicant would leave Canada at the end of her stay as a temporary resident. In reaching his decision, the Visa officer considered the Applicant's travel history, her family ties in Canada and her country of residence, Nigeria. The Visa officer took into consideration the Applicant's marriage to Ramoni Oguntola in 2006 and her ex-husband sponsorship for her in 2007. The Visa officer stated that the Applicant's proper application should have been that of a family class sponsorship.\nIV.\nParties' Submissions",
    "[6]\nThe Applicant submits that the Visa officer erred in applying the wrong test in assessing the Applicant's credibility. The Applicant argues that if the Visa officer had doubts about the intentions of the Applicant, then the Visa officer had a duty to ask the Applicant questions regarding his concerns. The Respondent replies by saying that it was open to the Visa officer to find that the Applicant would not leave Canada at the end of her authorized stay since her children and her husband reside in Canada and also because her husband unsuccessfully tried to sponsor her in the past. The Respondent further states that the Visa officer did not make a credibility finding, as the Applicant claims, but rather found that she did not meet her onus of demonstrating that she would go back to Nigeria at the end of her stay in Canada. The Visa officer therefore did not need to ask the Applicant for more information.",
    "[7]\nThe Applicant further states that the Visa officer erred in stating that the proper way for the Applicant to visit her children, two of which are minor, is via a family class sponsorship. The Applicant also states that the 2007 application is extrinsic to the current application and the Visa officer should not have relied on it as much as he did. The Respondent however says that the 2007 application is mentioned in the Applicant's visa application and is therefore not extrinsic evidence.",
    "[8]\nThe Applicant further states that the Visa officer erred in stating that she married Ramoni Oguntola in 2006 since the evidence demonstrate that this man is actually her father and that her actual husband is Ajeigbe Julius Olusegun, which she remarried in 2006 after their divorce in 1999. The Respondent replies that this is a clerical error and that the Visa officer was referring to the Applicant's husband. The Respondent adds that this error is immaterial and does not affect the Visa officer's decision.",
    "[9]\nThe Applicant also submits that the Visa officer erred in weighing her ties in Canada. The Respondent however explains that the Visa officer was entitled to conclude that her family ties in Canada did not demonstrate that she would leave at the end of her stay.",
    "[10]\nFinally, the Applicant also argues that the Visa officer failed to provide adequate reasons for his findings. The Respondent disagrees and submits that the reasons provided are sufficient to understand why the temporary visa application was dismissed by the Visa officer.\nV.\nIssue",
    "[11]\nI have reviewed the parties' submissions and respective records and I state the issue as follow:\n1. Is the Visa officer's decision to deny the temporary resident visa reasonable?\nVI.\nStandard of Review",
    "[12]\nThe question to issue a temporary resident visa by a visa officer is a discretionary decision, usually involving questions of facts, to which this Court affords deference (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Visa officers also have a recognized expertise in assessing applications for temporary visas ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). The reasonableness standard thus applies ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). This Court shall only intervene if it concludes that the decision is unreasonable and falls outside the \"range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] SCJ No 9 at para 47).\nVII.\nPreliminary Matter",
    "[13]\nThe Applicant has submitted documents in her Applicant's Application Record that are not part of the Certified Tribunal Record. According to case law, only evidence that was before the decision-maker can be considered by a Court on judicial review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). In the case at bar, the Court's record only contains the Applicant's Visitor's Visa Application. It does not contain any other documents, which the Applicant alleges were not taken into account by the Visa officer. The Court issued a direction asking the parties what was their position on the matter.",
    "[14]\nCounsel for the Applicant explained that her client informed her that the Visa officer returned to her all the supporting documents she had submitted along with her Nigerian Passport after denying her application. Counsel submitted that the Visa officer omitted or neglected to retain the supporting documents relied on by the Applicant in her record. The Respondent however argues that the Applicant never mentions in her Memorandum that her documents were not taken into account by the Visa officer and that the visa office has informed the Respondent that since storage space is minimal, all supporting documents were returned to the Applicant.",
    "[15]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Mandamin was in a situation where documents referred to by the Applicant were not part of the file before the visa officer. Justice Mandamin explained that the documents were also not in the record filed with the Court and that as such, they were not evidence and were excluded by the Court (at para 27).",
    "[16]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Applicant stated that the certified tribunal record was incomplete and that certain documents were missing. Because no evidence was adduced to support the proposition that this evidence was before the visa officer, Justice Blanchard decided that he had no option but \"to consider the certified tribunal record produced as reflecting the complete record before the visa officer\" (at para 11).",
    "[17]\nPursuant to the leave order issued January 13, 2015, the Visa officer was ordered pursuant to Rules 15 and 17 of the\nFederal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22, to produce the decision and supporting documents. The Visa officer forwarded the letters and notes in support of the decision made. As a response to a Directive issued by this Court enquiring as to the reason for not having produced the documents in support of the visa application, counsel for the Respondent informed that the supporting documents were returned to the Applicant because of minimal storage space in the office.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Layden-Stevenson explained that: [15] [...] While the failure to provide a certified record in accordance with the Rules does not, in itself, warrant automatic quashing of the decision:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), there is authority for the proposition that Rule 17 of the Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules, SOR/93-22 is mandatory. The tribunal must prepare and produce a record containing all documents relevant to the matter that are in the possession or control of the tribunal. The decision may be set aside when the record is incomplete:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Russell stated that an \"incomplete record is not necessarily grounds to set aside a decision, particularly where the decision-maker considered the material in question and the material is available to the Court\" (at para 52).",
    "[18] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[19]\nIn the case at bar, the only document in the Certified Tribunal Record is the Applicant's visa application. This Court has no way of validating the Applicant's argument that the Visa officer did not consider her documents, which she claimed were part of her application, as they are neither mentioned in the reasons provided by the Visa officer nor are they part of the Certified Tribunal Record. Only on this issue, this Court could conclude that because it does not have the visa application supporting documents, it has no way to satisfy itself that the Visa officer properly assessed the evidence in support of his conclusion.",
    "[20]\nHaving said that, it is appropriate in the present case to go further and assess this decision in light of the following documents. Given that this Court only has the Visa Application as part of the Certified Tribunal Record, only the Visa Application will be considered as reflecting the complete record before the Visa officer. The documents submitted by the Applicant will therefore not be considered.\nVIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nIs the Visa officer's decision to deny the temporary resident visa reasonable?",
    "[21]\nThere is a legal presumption that a foreign national seeking to enter Canada is presumed to be an immigrant (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As for visa officers, this Court has consistently held that visa officers denying applications for temporary resident visa must provide minimal reasons for their decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 20). \"An administrative tribunal's reasons are sufficient if they \"allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes\"\" (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[22]\nIn this case, the decision is based on the following reasons:\nPA seeking a TRV to visit her children in Canada. Application for a visitor visa being refused because, in my opinion, the proper application is a family class sponsorship. PA is currently married to Ramoni Oguntula - they have been married since 2006. Of interest, her ex-husband in Canada and father of her children there submitted a sponsorship for the applicant as a wife. Notes on file say they reconciled. If so, is the Applicant's husband still her husband? I am of the opinion that based on the family ties in Canada the applicant is strongly motivated to stay in Canada. As such, I am of the opinion that she would not leave Canada at the end of her authorised stay. Refused.",
    "[23]\nThe first reason for which the Visa officer denied the temporary resident visa is based on his opinion that the proper application is a family class sponsorship. This finding is erroneous as the visa application mentions that the purpose of the Applicant's travel is to visit her children (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] page 2). The Visa officer was to evaluate the temporary visa application and not suggest a different avenue for the Applicant to come and visit her children in Canada.",
    "[24]\nThe second reason for which the Visa officer refused the visa is based on an erroneous appreciation of the evidence in relation to the Applicant's current husband. The Visa officer erred in stating that Ramoni Oguntula and the Applicant have been married since 2006 because the visa application clearly states that this man is in fact the Applicant's father (CTR page 6). The visa application also shows that the Applicant's current husband is Julius Olusegun Ajeigbe, whom she remarried in 2006 (CTR page 1). I disagree with the Respondent that this error is immaterial and that the Visa officer fully understood the Applicant's visa application. This type of misunderstanding of the facts of the case gives an impression that the Visa officer did not really put his mind into the facts of the case.",
    "[25]\nThese two conclusions by the Visa officer do not explain how he came to the conclusion that the Applicant is strongly motivated to stay in Canada nor that she would not leave at the end of her stay. On the face of the record itself, these reasons are based on an erroneous finding of facts ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 12) and do not allow this Court to understand the reasoning behind the Visa officer's decision. Counsel for the Respondent did try to put some light into the reasons, but it is not her role to replace the reasoning made by the Visa officer. The intervention of this Court is thus warranted since the decision arrived at is not reasonable.\nIX.\nConclusion",
    "[26]\nThe Visa officer based his decision on erroneous findings of facts. The reasons provided do not allow this Court to understand the rejection of the visa application. The application will thus be allowed and the matter is to be remitted for reconsideration before another Visa officer.",
    "[27]\nThe parties were invited to submit questions for certification and the Applicant suggested the following one:\nAt Judicial Review, is the Federal Court still bound to accept/consider the Tribunal Record under section 17 of the\nFederal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\nas complete, where written evidence from the Tribunal itself indicates and admits that: contrary to subsection 17(b), many documents/papers relevant to the matter which were in its possession/control, were returned to the Applicant, and as such do not form part of the Tribunal Record sent to the Court for determination of the matter?",
    "[28]\nThe Respondent opposes the question because it does not contemplate an issue of broad significance and because it is not determinative of the appeal. He admits only at this late stage that the documents filed by the Applicant in her affidavit were submitted to the Visa officer as part of her record. This Court therefore had access to the same documents as the Visa officer did. The Respondent adds that the question also does not transcend the interests of the immediate parties, as the question is based on a highly factual situation.",
    "[29]\nThe Applicant, in its reply, argues that the negligence and omission of the Respondent's Tribunal to present to the Court a record containing all the relevant materials that were before it constitutes a fundamental breach of law, namely of paragraph 15(1)(\nb\n) and subsection 17(\nb\n) of the\nFederal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22. The Applicant adds that contrary to the Respondent's submissions, the documents provided by the Applicant as exhibits in her affidavit were not all the documents presented to the Visa officer, but only a few of them. The Applicant is of the opinion that the question is of broad significance that deserve judicial pronouncement.",
    "[30]\nThe principles governing the certification of a question pursuant to subsection 74(\nd\n) of IRPA were set out by the Federal Court of Appeal. The question \"must be one that transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation and contemplates issues of broad significance or general application\" (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  176 NR 4, at paras 4-6). It must be serious and of general importance and dispositive of the appeal (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[31]\nAs it can be noted above, the Visa officer's decision was assessed on the reasonableness of the decision, based on the Tribunal Record as filed, and not on the insufficiency of the Visa officer's record as filed. The question is therefore not determinative of the appeal. For this reason, the question will not be certified.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[32]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is to be returned for reconsideration before another Visa officer.\n2. No question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Christmas\n[Translation]: This Court is seized of an application for judicial review made by Modupe Ganiyat Idowu Ajeigbe [the applicant] pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA], of the decision by which the visa officer of the Immigration Section of the High Commission in Lagos rejected his application for a temporary resident visa [the visa].\nII.\nAlleged facts"

The question is therefore not determinative of the appeal. For this reason, the question will not be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n[32]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is to be returned for reconsideration before another Visa officer.\n2. No question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Noël\n[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire présentée par Modupe Ganiyat Idowu Ajeigbe [la demanderesse] sur le fondement du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], de la décision par laquelle l'agent des visas de la Section d'immigration du Haut-Commissariat à Lagos a rejeté sa demande de visa de résident temporaire [le visa].\nII.\nFaits allégués\n[2]\nLa demanderesse est originaire de la ville d'Alakulo, Lagos, au Nigéria.\n[3]\nEn 2007, son ex-époux a présenté une demande de visa permanent au titre de la catégorie du regroupement familial, laquelle a été refusée en 2009. La demande a été rejetée sur le fondement du paragraphe 4(1) et de l'alinéa 117(9)\nd\n) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/2002-227, puisque l'agent a estimé que la relation avec l'époux n'a jamais cessé.\n[4]\nLe ou vers le 3 juin 2014, la demanderesse a affirmé avoir été invitée par ses trois enfants canadiens à venir leur rendre visite au Canada, du 15 décembre 2014 au 14 janvier 2015. Elle a présenté une demande de visa de résident temporaire. Sa demande de visa a été rejetée le 8 septembre 2014. Cette décision fait l'objet du présent contrôle judiciaire.\nIII.\nDécision contestée\n[5]\nL'agent des visas a refusé la demande de visa parce que la demanderesse ne répondait pas aux conditions de délivrance du visa. L'agent des visas n'était pas convaincu que la demanderesse quitterait le Canada à la fin de son séjour à titre de résidente temporaire. Pour rendre sa décision, l'agent des visas a tenu compte des antécédents de voyage de la demanderesse, de ses liens familiaux au Canada et de son pays de résidence, le Nigéria. L'agent des visas a pris en considération le mariage de la demanderesse avec Ramoni Oguntola en 2006 et le fait que l'ex-époux a parrainé cette dernière en 2007. L'agent des visas a déclaré que la demanderesse aurait plutôt dû présenter une demande de parrainage au titre de la catégorie du regroupement familial.\nIV.\nObservations des parties\n[6]\nLa demanderesse soutient que l'agent des visas a commis une erreur en appliquant le mauvais critère pour évaluer sa crédibilité. La demanderesse fait valoir que si l'agent des visas avait des doutes au sujet de ses intentions, celui-ci devait lui poser des questions concernant ses préoccupations. Le défendeur a affirmé qu'il était loisible à l'agent des visas de conclure que la demanderesse ne quitterait pas le Canada à la fin de son séjour autorisé puisque ses enfants et son époux résident au Canada et aussi parce que ce dernier a tenté sans succès de la parrainer dans le passé. Le défendeur affirme en outre que l'agent des visas n'a pas tiré de conclusions en matière de crédibilité, comme le prétend la demanderesse, mais a plutôt conclu qu'elle ne s'était pas acquittée de son fardeau de démontrer qu'elle retournerait au Nigéria à la fin de son séjour au Canada. L'agent des visas n'avait donc pas besoin de demander à la demanderesse davantage de renseignements.\n[7]\nLa demanderesse fait observer en outre que l'agent des visas a commis une erreur en affirmant qu'elle devait, pour rendre visite à ses enfants, dont deux sont mineurs, présenter une demande de parrainage au titre de la catégorie du regroupement familial. La demanderesse indique également que la demande de 2007 est extrinsèque à la demande actuelle et que l'agent des visas n'aurait pas dû s'y fier autant qu'il l'a fait. Le défendeur précise cependant que la demande de 2007 figure dans la demande de visa de la demanderesse et qu'elle ne constitue donc pas une preuve extrinsèque.\n[8]\nLa demanderesse précise également que l'agent des visas a commis une erreur en affirmant qu'elle avait épousé Ramoni Oguntola en 2006 puisque la preuve démontre que cet homme est en fait son père et que son époux actuel est Ajeigbe Julius Olusegun, avec qui elle s'est remariée en 2006 après leur divorce en 1999. Le défendeur réplique qu'il s'agit d'une erreur d'écriture et que l'agent des visas faisait référence à l'époux de la demanderesse. Le défendeur ajoute que cette erreur est sans importance et n'a aucune incidence sur la décision de l'agent des visas.\n[9]\nLa demanderesse soutient également que l'agent des visas a commis une erreur en tenant compte de ses liens au Canada. Le défendeur explique cependant que l'agent des visas avait le droit de conclure que ses liens familiaux au Canada ne démontraient pas qu'elle quitterait le Canada à la fin de son séjour.\n[10]\nEnfin, la demanderesse fait aussi valoir que l'agent des visas n'a pas motivé adéquatement sa décision. Le défendeur n'est pas d'accord et soutient que les motifs fournis sont suffisants pour comprendre pourquoi la demande de visa temporaire a été rejetée par l'agent des visas.\nV.\nQuestion en litige\n[11]\nJ'ai examiné les observations des parties et leurs dossiers respectifs et j'énonce la question comme suit:\n1. La décision de l'agent des visas de refuser la demande de visa de résident temporaire est-elle raisonnable?\nVI.\nNorme de contrôle\n[12]\nLa décision de délivrer un visa de résidence temporaire pour venir au Canada est une décision discrétionnaire de l'agent des visas, qui soulève généralement des questions de fait, et envers laquelle la Cour fait preuve de déférence (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Les agents des visas ont une spécialisation reconnue dans l'évaluation de demandes de visa de résident temporaire ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée). Par conséquent, la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée). La Cour n'interviendra que si elle juge que la décision n'est pas raisonnable et n'appartient pas aux  issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit  (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACS no 9, au paragraphe 47).\nVII.\nQuestion préliminaire\n[13]\nLa demanderesse a présenté des documents dans son dossier de demande qui ne font pas partie du dossier certifié du tribunal. Suivant la jurisprudence, la cour siégeant en contrôle judiciaire peut seulement examiner la preuve dont était saisi le décideur (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). En l'espèce, le dossier de la Cour ne contient que la demande de visa de visiteur de la demanderesse. Il ne contient pas d'autres documents qui, selon la demanderesse, n'auraient pas été pris en compte par l'agent des visas. La Cour a émis une directive demandant aux parties quelle était leur position sur la question.\n[14]\nL'avocate de la demanderesse a expliqué que sa cliente l'a avisée que l'agent des visas lui avait retourné, après avoir refusé sa demande, tous les documents à l'appui qu'elle avait présentés, de même que son passeport nigérien. L'avocate a soutenu que l'agent des visas a omis ou négligé de conserver dans le dossier de la demanderesse les documents qu'elle avait présentés à l'appui de sa demande. Le défendeur soutient toutefois que la demanderesse n'a jamais indiqué dans son mémoire que ses documents n'ont pas été pris en compte par l'agent des visas et que le bureau des visas a avisé le défendeur que, étant donné l'espace de rangement limité, tous les documents à l'appui avaient été retournés à la demanderesse.\n[15]\nDans la décision\nNgalamulume,\nprécitée, les documents auxquels faisait référence la demanderesse ne figuraient pas dans le dossier à la disposition de l'agent des visas. Le juge Mandamin a expliqué que les documents ne figuraient pas non plus dans le dossier de la Cour et, par conséquent, n'avaient pas été constitués en preuve et avaient été écartés par la Cour (au paragraphe 27).\n[16]\nDans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, le demandeur affirmait que le dossier certifié du tribunal était incomplet et qu'il manquait certains documents. Comme aucun élément n'avait été produit pour appuyer la thèse que l'agent des visas disposait des éléments de preuve en question, le juge Blanchard a jugé qu'il n'avait d'autre choix que  de considérer que le dossier certifié du tribunal représente le dossier complet dont était saisi l'agent des visas  (au paragraphe 11).\n[17]\nConformément à l'ordonnance d'autorisation rendue le 13 janvier 2015, il a été ordonné à l'agent des visas, sur le fondement des articles 15 et 17 des\nRègles des cours fédérales en matière de citoyenneté, d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/93-22, de produire la décision et les documents à l'appui. L'agent des visas a transmis les lettres et notes à l'appui de la décision rendue. En réponse à une directive émise par la Cour demandant pourquoi les documents à l'appui de la demande de visa n'avaient pas été fournis, l'avocat du défendeur a affirmé que les documents à l'appui avaient été retournés à la demanderesse parce que l'espace de rangement dans le bureau était limité. Au paragraphe 15 de la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  la juge Layden-Stevenson a expliqué ce qui suit:\n[15] [...] Bien que le défaut de présenter un dossier certifié conforme aux Règles ne justifie pas, en soi, une annulation automatique de la décision:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.), certains précédents donnent à penser que l'application du paragraphe 17 des\nRègles des cours fédérales en matière d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/93-22 est obligatoire. Le tribunal doit constituer un dossier composé de tous les documents pertinents qui sont en la possession ou sous la garde du tribunal. La décision peut être annulée si le dossier est incomplet:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  le juge Russell a indiqué qu'un  dossier incomplet n'est pas nécessairement un motif d'annulation d'une décision, en particulier lorsque le décideur a pris en compte les documents en question et que la Cour a accès à ceux-ci  (au paragraphe 52).\n[19]\nEn l'espèce, le seul document figurant dans le dossier certifié du tribunal est la demande de visa de la demanderesse. La Cour n'a aucun moyen de valider l'argument de la demanderesse selon lequel l'agent des visas n'a pas tenu compte de ses documents qui, selon elle, faisaient partie de sa demande, étant donné qu'ils ne sont pas mentionnés dans les motifs fournis par l'agent des visas et ne font pas partie du dossier certifié du tribunal. Sur cette question seulement, la Cour pourrait conclure que, parce qu'il n'y a pas de documents à l'appui de la demande de visa, elle n'a aucun moyen de s'assurer que l'agent des visas a apprécié correctement la preuve qui lui a été présentée pour parvenir à sa décision.\n[20]\nCela dit, il convient en l'espèce d'aller plus loin et d'évaluer cette décision à la lumière des documents suivants. Étant donné que seule la demande de visa fait partie du dossier certifié du tribunal à la disposition de la Cour, seule celle-ci sera considérée comme constituant l'ensemble du dossier dont disposait l'agent des visas. Par conséquent, les documents présentés par la demanderesse ne seront pas pris en considération.\nVIII.\nAnalyse\nA.\nLa décision de l'agent des visas de refuser la demande de visa de résident temporaire est-elle raisonnable?\n[21]\nIl existe une présomption légale selon laquelle l'étranger qui cherche à entrer au Canada est présumé être un immigrant (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). En ce qui a trait aux agents des visas, la Cour a statué de façon constante que les agents des visas refusant une demande de visa de résident temporaire doivent motiver leurs décisions de façon minimale ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 20).  Les motifs d'un tribunal administratif sont suffisants s'ils \"permettent à la cour de révision de comprendre le fondement de la décision du tribunal et de déterminer si la conclusion fait partie des issues possibles acceptables\"  (Newfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[22]\nEn l'espèce, la décision est fondée sur les motifs suivants:\n[traduction] La DP demande un VRT pour rendre visite à ses enfants au Canada. La demande de visa de visiteur lui a été refusée parce que, à mon avis, la demanderesse aurait plutôt dû présenter une demande de parrainage au titre de la catégorie du regroupement familial. La DP est actuellement mariée à Ramoni Oguntula - ils sont mariés depuis 2006. Il est intéressant de noter que son ex-époux au Canada et père de ses enfants a présenté une demande de parrainage de la demanderesse en tant qu'épouse. Les notes au dossier indiquent qu'ils se sont réconciliés. Si c'est le cas, le mari de la demanderesse est-il toujours son époux? Je suis d'avis que, compte tenu de ses liens familiaux au Canada, la demanderesse est très motivée de rester au Canada. En conséquence, je suis d'avis qu'elle ne quitterait pas le Canada à la fin de la période de séjour autorisée. Demande refusée.\n[23]\nPremièrement, l'agent des visas a refusé la demande de visa de résident temporaire parce qu'à son avis, la demanderesse aurait plutôt dû présenter une demande de parrainage au titre de la catégorie du regroupement familial. Cette conclusion est erronée, puisque la demande de visa indique que le but du voyage de la demanderesse est de rendre visite à ses enfants (dossier certifié du tribunal [DCT], à la page 2). L'agent des visas devait évaluer la demande de visa temporaire; il n'avait pas à proposer à la demanderesse un autre moyen pour venir au Canada et rendre visite à ses enfants.\n[24]\nLe deuxième motif pour lequel l'agent des visas a refusé la demande de visa repose sur une appréciation erronée de la preuve relative à l'époux actuel de la demanderesse. L'agent des visas a commis une erreur en affirmant que Ramoni Oguntula et la demanderesse étaient mariés depuis 2006, parce que la demande de visa indique clairement que cet homme est en fait le père de la demanderesse (DCT, à la page 6). La demande de visa montre également que l'époux actuel de la demanderesse est Julius Olusegun Ajeigbe, avec qui elle s'est remariée en 2006 (DCT, à la page 1). Je ne suis pas d'accord avec le défendeur pour dire que cette erreur est sans importance et que l'agent des visas a bien compris la demande de visa de la demanderesse. Ce genre de malentendu concernant les faits en l'espèce donne l'impression que l'agent des visas n'a pas vraiment porté son attention sur les faits en l'espèce.\n[25]\nCes deux conclusions de l'agent des visas n'expliquent pas comment il en est arrivé à la conclusion que la demanderesse est très motivée de rester au Canada et qu'elle ne quitterait pas le Canada à la fin de son séjour. Au vu du dossier, ces motifs reposent sur une conclusion de fait erronée ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précitée, au paragraphe 12) et ne permettent pas à la Cour de comprendre le raisonnement qui a motivé la décision de l'agent des visas. L'avocate du défendeur a tenté d'éclaircir les motifs, mais il ne lui revient pas de remplacer le raisonnement suivi par l'agent des visas. L'intervention de la Cour est donc justifiée puisque la décision de l'agent n'est pas raisonnable.\nVIII.\nConclusion\n[26]\nL'agent des visas a fondé sa décision sur des conclusions de faits erronées. Les motifs donnés ne permettent pas à la Cour de comprendre le rejet de la demande de visa. Par conséquent, la demande sera accueillie et l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent des visas pour qu'il l'examine de nouveau.\n[27]\nLes parties ont été invitées à soumettre des questions à certifier et la demanderesse a proposé la question suivante:\n[traduction] Lors d'un contrôle judiciaire, la Cour fédérale est-elle toujours tenue d'accepter ou de considérer que le dossier du tribunal, en application de l'article 17 des\nRègles des cours fédérales en matière de citoyenneté, d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés\n, est complet lorsque la preuve écrite transmise par le tribunal lui-même indique et admet que: contrairement à l'alinéa 17\nb\n), de nombreux documents pertinents qui étaient en la possession ou sous la garde du tribunal ont été retournés au demandeur et que, en conséquence, ils ne font pas partie du dossier du tribunal transmis à la Cour pour qu'elle rende une décision?\n[28]\nLe défendeur s'oppose à la question au motif qu'elle n'aborde pas d'éléments ayant des conséquences importantes et ne permet pas de trancher l'appel. Il admet seulement à cette étape tardive que les documents déposés par la demanderesse dans son affidavit ont été fournis à l'agent des visas avec son dossier. La Cour avait donc accès aux mêmes documents que l'agent des visas. Le défendeur ajoute que la question ne transcende pas les intérêts des parties en cause, puisqu'elle repose sur une situation fondée largement sur des faits.\n[29]\nDans sa réplique, la demanderesse fait valoir que la négligence et l'omission du tribunal administratif de présenter à la Cour un dossier contenant tous les documents pertinents dont il disposait constitue une violation fondamentale de la loi, soit des alinéas 15(1)\nb\n) et 17\nb\n) des\nRègles des cours fédérales en matière de citoyenneté, d'immigration et de protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/93-22. La demanderesse ajoute que, contrairement aux observations du défendeur, les documents déposés comme pièces dans son affidavit ne constituaient pas tous les documents présentés à l'agent des visas, mais seulement quelques-uns d'entre eux. La demanderesse est d'avis que la question est d'une grande importance et doit faire l'objet d'une décision.\n[30]\nLes principes régissant la certification d'une question, conformément à l'alinéa 74\nd\n) de la LIPR, ont été énoncés par la Cour d'appel fédérale. La question  doit transcender les intérêts des parties au litige et aborder des éléments qui ont des conséquences importantes ou qui sont de portée générale  (\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  176 NR 4, aux paragraphes 4 à 6). Il doit s'agir d'une question grave de portée générale qui permet de trancher l'appel (\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 12;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 29).\n[31]\nComme il peut être constaté plus haut, la décision de l'agent des visas a été examinée selon son caractère raisonnable, sur le fondement du dossier du tribunal tel qu'il a été déposé, et non sur les lacunes du dossier de l'agent des visas tel qu'il a été déposé. Par conséquent, la question ne permet pas de trancher l'appel. Pour cette raison, la question ne sera pas certifiée.\nJUGEMENT\n[32]\nLA COUR STATUE que\n:\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et l'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent des visas pour nouvel examen.\n2. Aucune question n'est certifiée.\n[End of document]",

Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI.\nIntroduction\n\n[1]\nNoël, J.\n: This is an application by Modupe Ganiyat Idowu Ajeigbe [the Applicant] for a judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] of the decision of a Visa officer of the Immigration Section of the High Commission in Lagos refusing the Applicant's application for a temporary resident visa [the visa].\nII.\nAlleged Facts\n\n[2]\nThe Applicant is from the City of Alakulo, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n[3]\nIn 2007, her ex-husband submitted an application for a permanent visa as a member of the family class, which was refused in 2009. The application was dismissed pursuant to subsection 4(1) and paragraph 117(9)(\nd\n) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227, whereby the officer was of the opinion that the relationship with the husband never ceased.\n\n[4]\nOn or about June 3, 2014, the Applicant claimed to have been invited by her three Canadian children to come and visit them in Canada from December 15, 2014 to January 14, 2015. She applied for a temporary resident visa. This visa was denied on September 8, 2014. This is the decision under review.\nIII.\nImpugned Decision\n\n[5]\nThe Visa officer refused the visa because the Applicant did not meet the requirements for it. The Visa officer was not satisfied that the Applicant would leave Canada at the end of her stay as a temporary resident. In reaching his decision, the Visa officer considered the Applicant's travel history, her family ties in Canada and her country of residence, Nigeria. The Visa officer took into consideration the Applicant's marriage to Ramoni Oguntola in 2006 and her ex-husband sponsorship for her in 2007. The Visa officer stated that the Applicant's proper application should have been that of a family class sponsorship.\nIV.\nParties' Submissions\n\n[6]\nThe Applicant submits that the Visa officer erred in applying the wrong test in assessing the Applicant's credibility. The Applicant argues that if the Visa officer had doubts about the intentions of the Applicant, then the Visa officer had a duty to ask the Applicant questions regarding his concerns. The Respondent replies by saying that it was open to the Visa officer to find that the Applicant would not leave Canada at the end of her authorized stay since her children and her husband reside in Canada and also because her husband unsuccessfully tried to sponsor her in the past. The Respondent further states that the Visa officer did not make a credibility finding, as the Applicant claims, but rather found that she did not meet her onus of demonstrating that she would go back to Nigeria at the end of her stay in Canada. The Visa officer therefore did not need to ask the Applicant for more information.\n\n[7]\nThe Applicant further states that the Visa officer erred in stating that the proper way for the Applicant to visit her children, two of which are minor, is via a family class sponsorship. The Applicant also states that the 2007 application is extrinsic to the current application and the Visa officer should not have relied on it as much as he did. The Respondent however says that the 2007 application is mentioned in the Applicant's visa application and is therefore not extrinsic evidence.\n\n[8]\nThe Applicant further states that the Visa officer erred in stating that she married Ramoni Oguntola in 2006 since the evidence demonstrate that this man is actually her father and that her actual husband is Ajeigbe Julius Olusegun, which she remarried in 2006 after their divorce in 1999. The Respondent replies that this is a clerical error and that the Visa officer was referring to the Applicant's husband. The Respondent adds that this error is immaterial and does not affect the Visa officer's decision.\n\n[9]\nThe Applicant also submits that the Visa officer erred in weighing her ties in Canada. The Respondent however explains that the Visa officer was entitled to conclude that her family ties in Canada did not demonstrate that she would leave at the end of her stay.\n\n[10]\nFinally, the Applicant also argues that the Visa officer failed to provide adequate reasons for his findings. The Respondent disagrees and submits that the reasons provided are sufficient to understand why the temporary visa application was dismissed by the Visa officer.\nV.\nIssue\n\n[11]\nI have reviewed the parties' submissions and respective records and I state the issue as follow:\n1. Is the Visa officer's decision to deny the temporary resident visa reasonable?\nVI.\nStandard of Review\n\n[12]\nThe question to issue a temporary resident visa by a visa officer is a discretionary decision, usually involving questions of facts, to which this Court affords deference (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). Visa officers also have a recognized expertise in assessing applications for temporary visas ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). The reasonableness standard thus applies ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above). This Court shall only intervene if it concludes that the decision is unreasonable and falls outside the \"range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] SCJ No 9 at para 47).\nVII.\nPreliminary Matter\n\n[13]\nThe Applicant has submitted documents in her Applicant's Application Record that are not part of the Certified Tribunal Record. According to case law, only evidence that was before the decision-maker can be considered by a Court on judicial review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]). In the case at bar, the Court's record only contains the Applicant's Visitor's Visa Application. It does not contain any other documents, which the Applicant alleges were not taken into account by the Visa officer. The Court issued a direction asking the parties what was their position on the matter.\n\n[14]\nCounsel for the Applicant explained that her client informed her that the Visa officer returned to her all the supporting documents she had submitted along with her Nigerian Passport after denying her application. Counsel submitted that the Visa officer omitted or neglected to retain the supporting documents relied on by the Applicant in her record. The Respondent however argues that the Applicant never mentions in her Memorandum that her documents were not taken into account by the Visa officer and that the visa office has informed the Respondent that since storage space is minimal, all supporting documents were returned to the Applicant.\n\n[15]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, Justice Mandamin was in a situation where documents referred to by the Applicant were not part of the file before the visa officer. Justice Mandamin explained that the documents were also not in the record filed with the Court and that as such, they were not evidence and were excluded by the Court (at para 27).\n\n[16]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the Applicant stated that the certified tribunal record was incomplete and that certain documents were missing. Because no evidence was adduced to support the proposition that this evidence was before the visa officer, Justice Blanchard decided that he had no option but \"to consider the certified tribunal record produced as reflecting the complete record before the visa officer\" (at para 11).\n\n[17]\nPursuant to the leave order issued January 13, 2015, the Visa officer was ordered pursuant to Rules 15 and 17 of the\nFederal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22, to produce the decision and supporting documents. The Visa officer forwarded the letters and notes in support of the decision made. As a response to a Directive issued by this Court enquiring as to the reason for not having produced the documents in support of the visa application, counsel for the Respondent informed that the supporting documents were returned to the Applicant because of minimal storage space in the office.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Justice Layden-Stevenson explained that: [15] [...] While the failure to provide a certified record in accordance with the Rules does not, in itself, warrant automatic quashing of the decision:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), there is authority for the proposition that Rule 17 of the Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules, SOR/93-22 is mandatory. The tribunal must prepare and produce a record containing all documents relevant to the matter that are in the possession or control of the tribunal. The decision may be set aside when the record is incomplete:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Justice Russell stated that an \"incomplete record is not necessarily grounds to set aside a decision, particularly where the decision-maker considered the material in question and the material is available to the Court\" (at para 52).\n\n[18] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[19]\nIn the case at bar, the only document in the Certified Tribunal Record is the Applicant's visa application. This Court has no way of validating the Applicant's argument that the Visa officer did not consider her documents, which she claimed were part of her application, as they are neither mentioned in the reasons provided by the Visa officer nor are they part of the Certified Tribunal Record. Only on this issue, this Court could conclude that because it does not have the visa application supporting documents, it has no way to satisfy itself that the Visa officer properly assessed the evidence in support of his conclusion.\n\n[20]\nHaving said that, it is appropriate in the present case to go further and assess this decision in light of the following documents. Given that this Court only has the Visa Application as part of the Certified Tribunal Record, only the Visa Application will be considered as reflecting the complete record before the Visa officer. The documents submitted by the Applicant will therefore not be considered.\nVIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nIs the Visa officer's decision to deny the temporary resident visa reasonable?\n\n[21]\nThere is a legal presumption that a foreign national seeking to enter Canada is presumed to be an immigrant (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). As for visa officers, this Court has consistently held that visa officers denying applications for temporary resident visa must provide minimal reasons for their decision ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 20). \"An administrative tribunal's reasons are sufficient if they \"allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes\"\" (\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[22]\nIn this case, the decision is based on the following reasons:\nPA seeking a TRV to visit her children in Canada. Application for a visitor visa being refused because, in my opinion, the proper application is a family class sponsorship. PA is currently married to Ramoni Oguntula - they have been married since 2006. Of interest, her ex-husband in Canada and father of her children there submitted a sponsorship for the applicant as a wife. Notes on file say they reconciled. If so, is the Applicant's husband still her husband? I am of the opinion that based on the family ties in Canada the applicant is strongly motivated to stay in Canada. As such, I am of the opinion that she would not leave Canada at the end of her authorised stay. Refused.\n\n[23]\nThe first reason for which the Visa officer denied the temporary resident visa is based on his opinion that the proper application is a family class sponsorship. This finding is erroneous as the visa application mentions that the purpose of the Applicant's travel is to visit her children (Certified Tribunal Record [CTR] page 2). The Visa officer was to evaluate the temporary visa application and not suggest a different avenue for the Applicant to come and visit her children in Canada.\n\n[24]\nThe second reason for which the Visa officer refused the visa is based on an erroneous appreciation of the evidence in relation to the Applicant's current husband. The Visa officer erred in stating that Ramoni Oguntula and the Applicant have been married since 2006 because the visa application clearly states that this man is in fact the Applicant's father (CTR page 6). The visa application also shows that the Applicant's current husband is Julius Olusegun Ajeigbe, whom she remarried in 2006 (CTR page 1). I disagree with the Respondent that this error is immaterial and that the Visa officer fully understood the Applicant's visa application. This type of misunderstanding of the facts of the case gives an impression that the Visa officer did not really put his mind into the facts of the case.\n\n[25]\nThese two conclusions by the Visa officer do not explain how he came to the conclusion that the Applicant is strongly motivated to stay in Canada nor that she would not leave at the end of her stay. On the face of the record itself, these reasons are based on an erroneous finding of facts ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 12) and do not allow this Court to understand the reasoning behind the Visa officer's decision. Counsel for the Respondent did try to put some light into the reasons, but it is not her role to replace the reasoning made by the Visa officer. The intervention of this Court is thus warranted since the decision arrived at is not reasonable.\nIX.\nConclusion\n\n[26]\nThe Visa officer based his decision on erroneous findings of facts. The reasons provided do not allow this Court to understand the rejection of the visa application. The application will thus be allowed and the matter is to be remitted for reconsideration before another Visa officer.\n\n[27]\nThe parties were invited to submit questions for certification and the Applicant suggested the following one:\nAt Judicial Review, is the Federal Court still bound to accept/consider the Tribunal Record under section 17 of the\nFederal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\nas complete, where written evidence from the Tribunal itself indicates and admits that: contrary to subsection 17(b), many documents/papers relevant to the matter which were in its possession/control, were returned to the Applicant, and as such do not form part of the Tribunal Record sent to the Court for determination of the matter?\n\n[28]\nThe Respondent opposes the question because it does not contemplate an issue of broad significance and because it is not determinative of the appeal. He admits only at this late stage that the documents filed by the Applicant in her affidavit were submitted to the Visa officer as part of her record. This Court therefore had access to the same documents as the Visa officer did. The Respondent adds that the question also does not transcend the interests of the immediate parties, as the question is based on a highly factual situation.\n\n[29]\nThe Applicant, in its reply, argues that the negligence and omission of the Respondent's Tribunal to present to the Court a record containing all the relevant materials that were before it constitutes a fundamental breach of law, namely of paragraph 15(1)(\nb\n) and subsection 17(\nb\n) of the\nFederal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22. The Applicant adds that contrary to the Respondent's submissions, the documents provided by the Applicant as exhibits in her affidavit were not all the documents presented to the Visa officer, but only a few of them. The Applicant is of the opinion that the question is of broad significance that deserve judicial pronouncement.\n\n[30]\nThe principles governing the certification of a question pursuant to subsection 74(\nd\n) of IRPA were set out by the Federal Court of Appeal. The question \"must be one that transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation and contemplates issues of broad significance or general application\" (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  176 NR 4, at paras 4-6). It must be serious and of general importance and dispositive of the appeal (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[31]\nAs it can be noted above, the Visa officer's decision was assessed on the reasonableness of the decision, based on the Tribunal Record as filed, and not on the insufficiency of the Visa officer's record as filed. The question is therefore not determinative of the appeal. For this reason, the question will not be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[32]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is to be returned for reconsideration before another Visa officer.\n2. No question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Christmas\n[Translation]: This Court is seized of an application for judicial review made by Modupe Ganiyat Idowu Ajeigbe [the applicant] pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA], of the decision by which the visa officer of the Immigration Section of the High Commission in Lagos rejected his application for a temporary resident visa [the visa].\nII.\nAlleged facts",

      "The visa application was submitted on or about June 3, 2014, and was refused on September 8, 2014.",
      "The applicant's ex-husband previously applied for permanent residency in Canada in 2007, but the application was refused in 2009 due to questions regarding the continuation of the marital relationship.",
      "The visa officer refused the application based on concerns the applicant would not leave Canada at the end of her authorized stay.",
      "The visa officer considered the applicant’s travel history, family ties in Canada and Nigeria, and her marital history in the decision.",
      "The applicant was married to Ramoni Oguntola in 2006 and divorced, subsequently marrying Ajeigbe Julius Olusegun in the same year.",

        "The proper way for the Applicant to visit her children is not via a family class sponsorship.",

        "The Visa officer did not make a credibility finding, but rather found that the Applicant did not meet her onus of demonstrating that she would return to Nigeria.",
        "The 2007 application is not extrinsic evidence as it was mentioned in the Applicant's visa application.",
        "The statement about the Applicant marrying Ramoni Oguntola in 2006 was a clerical error referring to her husband, and the error is immaterial.",
        "The Visa officer was entitled to conclude that her family ties in Canada did not demonstrate that she would leave at the end of her stay.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court applied a reasonableness standard of review to the Visa officer’s decision, acknowledging the officer’s discretion and expertise in immigration matters, and intervening only if the decision fell outside an acceptable range of outcomes.",
      "The court found the Visa officer’s reasoning flawed on two key points: first, the officer incorrectly suggested the applicant should pursue family class sponsorship instead of evaluating the temporary resident visa application on its merits; and second, the officer misstated the applicant’s marital status, identifying her father as her husband.",
      "The court determined that these factual errors undermined the reasoning behind the denial, as the officer’s conclusions about the applicant’s ties to Canada were based on these inaccuracies. The court emphasized that the errors created an impression the officer hadn't properly considered the facts.",
      "The court held that the officer’s reasons, even as supplemented by counsel’s arguments, were insufficient to demonstrate a rational connection between the stated reasons and the conclusion that the applicant would not leave Canada at the end of her authorized stay.",
      "The court addressed a preliminary matter regarding missing documents from the record, ruling that it could only consider the certified tribunal record (the visa application itself) and could not rely on evidence of documents the applicant claimed were submitted but not retained by the visa officer. However, the court found that the lack of supporting documents prevented it from fully assessing whether the officer properly considered the available evidence.",
      "Because of the erroneous findings and insufficient reasoning, the court allowed the application for judicial review and ordered the matter remitted for reconsideration by a different Visa officer."
