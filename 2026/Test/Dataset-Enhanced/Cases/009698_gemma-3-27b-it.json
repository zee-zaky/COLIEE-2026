    "[1]\nRouleau, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer dated July 29, 1993, wherein it was determined that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant processing his application for permanent residence from within Canada.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant, a citizen of Trinidad, arrived in Canada on June 18, 1988, and claimed Convention refugee status. He was eventually joined in Canada by his wife and two sons. On October 23, 1992, it was determined that there was no credible basis to his claim; a \"back end\" humanitarian and compassionate review determined that there were no exceptional circumstances so as to warrant the exercise of the Governor-in-Council's discretion for processing from within Canada, and a departure notice was issued on December 12, 1993.",
    "[3]\nOn May 14, 1993, the applicant made yet another request for reconsideration on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. He states that he has been steadily employed in Canada since November 1989 and together with his wife, they earn approximately $40,000 per annum. They have purchased a car, household furnishings and they have approximately $10,000 in savings. They have established roots in the community; both boys attend school, they attend the Hindu temple in Pickering on a regular basis and he volunteers his spare time to the care of an elderly disabled gentleman. They regard Canada as their home and if permitted to stay, he intends to establish his own electrical business. They have no home or assets in Trinidad and if forced to leave, it is highly unlikely that he could find employment while waiting for his application for permanent residence to be processed. He believes that, having due regard to their emotional and economic establishment in Canada; the hardship that would be caused if he has to leave Canada warrants favourable consideration.",
