    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FC)\nMLB unedited judgment\n[French language version follows English language version]\n[La version française vient à la suite de la version anglaise]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 351)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nBédard, J.\nMarch 22, 2012.\nCounsel:\nJean-François Bertrand, for the applicant;\nYael Levy, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nBertrand, Deslauriers, Montreal, Quebec, for the applicant;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2012] F.T.R. TBEd. AP.019.",
    "[1]\nBédard, J.\n: The applicant is a citizen of Oman. He filed an application for a permanent resident visa to Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class. His application was refused on April 4, 2011, because the adjudicating immigration officer found that he provided insufficient details about his employment.",
    "[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review of that decision pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27. For the following reasons the application is dismissed.\nI.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe applicant submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class on September 17, 2007. He included his wife and child in his application.",
    "[4]\nHe stated in his application that he was employed as a pilot for Gulf Air. According to the National Occupation Classification (NOC), the occupation of pilot is classified under NOC 2271 and categorized under Skill Level B.",
    "[5]\nOn March 11, 2010, the High Commission of Canada in London sent a letter to the applicant informing him that his application was being transferred to the Case Processing Pilot in Ottawa, as part of the Government of Canada's Action Plan for Faster Immigration, implemented to expedite processing times for certain types of applications. This letter also requested several documents from the applicant, including an updated visa application form and documents substantiating his work experience. With respect to the latter, the letter specified the following:\nProvide employment letters, contracts, pay-slips and\njob descriptions endorsed by your employer's personnel department\ncovering the period from 10 years prior to your application date until today.\nPlease make sure that the employment letters have details of your duties\nand clearly show the start and end dates (if relevant) of your employment. CPP-O is under no obligation to further request detailed employment letters, and your work experience review will be based solely on the documents initially provided.\n[Emphasis added]",
    "[6]\nIn July 2010, the applicant submitted several documents, including a letter from his employer, Gulf Air, dated June 21, 2010, attesting that he had been employed by Gulf Air since April 19, 1992. The letter stated that the applicant works as a captain in the Airbus Fleet Management.",
    "[7]\nIn Schedule 3 of his updated application, the applicant indicated, in the section dealing with work experience, that he had been employed as a pilot since April 1992, and he described his main duties as follows:\na. Fly aircrafts fro [\nsic\n] Gulf airlines to transport passengers and freight;\nb. Direct activities of aircraft crew during flight, as captain of aircraft\nc. Co-pilot aircraft and perform captain's duties of required, as first officer\nd. Train pilots to use new equipment\nII.\nThe decision under review",
    "[8]\nThe immigration officer decided that the applicant did not meet the definition of a Federal Skilled Worker pursuant to paragraphs 75(2)(\nb\n) and (\nc\n) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SORS/2002-227 [the Regulations]. The immigration officer indicated that she was not satisfied that the applicant met the requirements of the Regulations because he failed to provide sufficient details about his employment, as requested. The immigration officer explained her reasoning as follows:\n. . . The employment confirmation from Gulf Air did not give any job description or a description of the duties performed for the position. There is insufficient information on the document provided by your employer to satisfy me that you have performed the main duties of the position described. You were asked, by letter from our London office dated March 11, 2010, to provide your work experience documents, including details of your duties. That same email informed you that failure to provide these documents would result in an assessment of your application based on the documents initially on file. After reviewing all documents provided, I am not satisfied you have performed the actions as set out in the lead statements of the NOC stated, and that you have performed a substantial number of the main duties of the position as described in the NOC. As a result, I am not satisfied that you meet the minimum requirements to apply as a skilled worker as stated in R75.\nIII.\nIssue",
    "[9]\nThis case raises the issue of the reasonableness of the immigration officer's decision.\nIV.\nStandard of review",
    "[10]\nIt is well established that decisions made by immigration officers regarding applicants' eligibility for permanent residence in Canada as members of the Federal Skilled Worker class involve an exercise of discretion and attract the reasonableness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [\nMihura Torres\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 247;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 153;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [\nMalik\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [47] . . . A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\nV.\nAnalysis",
    "[11] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[12]\nThe applicant argues that the immigration officer fettered her discretion by relying on departmental guidelines, as they are outlined in the March 11, 2010 letter. The applicant further alleges that the immigration officer refused his application solely on the basis that he did not provide an employer's letter that described the main duties of his job as a pilot. However, the legislation and the Regulations do not specify the means by which one must establish that an applicant exercises the main duties of an occupation and do not specifically require employers' letters that include job descriptions. Accordingly, the applicant submits that the immigration officer's decision is unreasonable.",
    "[13]\nThe applicant also argues that it was unreasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that he had not satisfactorily established his main duties as a pilot for Gulf Air. The applicant insists that there was no issue of credibility in his case and that the evidence he submitted clearly established his main duties as a pilot. First, he argues that the specific job duties of a pilot, and more particularly of a captain, are obvious and an immigration officer is expected to know what they are. Second, he alleges that the description of his main duties in Schedule 3, combined with the confirmation letter provided by his employer, was sufficient to establish that he genuinely works as a pilot for Gulf Air and was also sufficient to establish his job duties.",
    "[14]\nThe respondent argues, for his part, that the onus was on the applicant to establish that he met the requirements to be admitted to Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker and that the request to submit detailed employers' letters for the past 10 years, was explicitly outlined in the letter sent to him on March 11, 2010. The respondent argues that considering that the applicant did not submit the documentation that was required of him, it was reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude as she did.",
    "[15]\nThe respondent further argues that none of the documents provided by the applicant list the main duties of his work as a pilot, nor do they provide a job description. The respondent contends that the applicant simply copied and pasted the job duties from NOC 2271 to his Schedule 3 form and that this was not enough to satisfy his burden of proof. Rather, it was reasonable for the immigration officer to expect objective evidence from the applicant's employer. Without this evidence, the immigration officer was unable to assess whether the applicant had experience relevant to the duties outlined in NOC 2271 and this was sufficient to justify the finding that the applicant was ineligible for immigration to Canada pursuant to subsection 75(2) of the Regulations.\nVI.\nDiscussion",
    "[16]\nA Federal Skilled Worker is defined at subsection 75(2) of the Regulations:\n(2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if\n(\nhas\n) within the 10 years preceding the date of their application for a permanent resident visa, they have at least one year of continuous full-time employment experience, as described in subsection 80(7), or the equivalent in continuous part-time employment in one or more occupations, other than a restricted occupation, that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the\nNational Occupational Classification\nmatrix;\n(\nb\n) during that period of employment they performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n; and\n(\nc\n) during that period of employment they performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n, including all of the essential duties..\n(2) A foreigner is a qualified worker who meets the following requirements:\nhas\n) he has accumulated at least one continuous year of full-time work experience within the meaning of subsection 80(7), or the equivalent if he works part-time continuously, during the ten years preceding the date of submission of the permanent resident visa application, in at least one of the professions belonging to skill type 0 Management or skill levels A or B of the matrix of the\nNational occupational classification\n- except for professions with limited access;\n(b) during this period of employment, he accomplished all of the tasks appearing in the main statement established for the profession in the descriptions of the professions of this classification;\n(c) during this period of employment, he performed an appreciable part of the main functions of the profession appearing in the descriptions of the professions of this classification, including all the essential functions.",
    "[17]\nPursuant to this provision, a foreign national must have at least one year of full time employment, or the equivalent within the past ten years, in one or more of certain types of occupations. In addition, he or she must have performed the actions described in the lead statement set out in the NOC for the occupation in question, as well as a substantial number of the main duties set out in the NOC. This requirement is coherent with the need to ensure that the duties that an applicant performed for a position held in their country of origin, correspond to the Canadian duties of the same occupation.",
    "[18]\nThe onus was on the applicant to establish that, within the past ten years, he performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation of a pilot as set out in NOC 2271 and that he performed a substantial number of the main duties of this occupation for at least one year. (\nMihura  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 37;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 858). The applicant is responsible for supplying enough supporting documents and evidence and he must put his best case forward (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 355;\nMihura  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 40). The immigration officer is under no obligation to request further clarification from the applicant if he or she finds there is not enough evidence initially submitted (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII)).",
    "[19]\nIn order to evaluate admissibility, immigration officers need sufficient information to assess an applicant's job experience. They also need to verify the completeness and accuracy of the information that applicants submit with their application. In that sense, it is reasonable to require, as a general rule, that applicants provide corroborative third party information such as employers' letters that include details about the applicants' duties and /or job descriptions (\nMalik\n, above, at para 33). These types of documents provide immigration officers with a complete picture of an applicant's duties and responsibilities and allow them to determine whether the duties performed by an applicant in his or her country of origin are similar to the Canadian description of the given occupation. In some cases, the information provided by employers also serves to confirm that an applicant actually performed the actions and duties that he or she claims to have performed.",
    "[20]\nIn this case, the applicant did not meet his evidentiary burden.",
    "[21]\nFirst, in his description of his duties, the applicant limited himself to re-stating the main duties of a pilot as described in the NOC, without providing any further details about these duties. The applicant is asking the Court to infer, from this very generic information provided by the applicant, that a person employed as a captain for Gulf Air performs the same duties as those described in NOC 2271. In my view, it is neither for the immigration officer nor for the Court to make this inference. As mentioned above, the onus is on the applicant to establish that he meets the criteria as a Federal Skilled Worker and he failed to do so despite specific instructions on what types of documents are required. In my view, the applicant failed to meet the evidentiary burden required by subsection 75(2) of the Regulations because he did not provide sufficient information about his job duties and responsibilities.",
    "[22]\nSecond, there is no doubt that the letter from the applicant's employer did not contain all the information that was plainly required by the immigration officer in the letter dated March 11, 2010. The employer's letter states only that the applicant is employed as a captain in the Airbus Fleet Management. The letter is silent as to the duties and responsibilities carried out by a captain in Gulf Air's Airbus Fleet Management. In fact, the employer's letter does not even include information about the activities of Air Gulf or its fleet.",
    "[23]\nThe applicant argues that the duties of a pilot are obvious and that the immigration officer is expected to know what they are. This argument requires that the immigration officer assume that a pilot for Gulf Air performs the duties as described in NOC 2271. With respect, an immigration officer should not determine whether an applicant's work experience corresponds to the lead statement and main duties set out in the NOC for an occupation based on his personal knowledge of an occupation or on the personal knowledge that an applicant imputes to the immigration officer. Immigration officers must assess applications based on the evidence that applicants put forward and not on their own personal knowledge or assumptions. In my view, this is the only rigorous, fair, cohesive and coherent approach to assessing whether an applicant has performed the main duties of any position described in the NOC.",
    "[24]\nFinally, the applicant faults the immigration officer for having relied on a general guideline and argues that, in doing so, she fettered her discretion. I disagree. I have already stated that it is reasonable to require information from applicants' employers about the specific duties of an occupation. While I acknowledge that immigration officers cannot treat administrative guidelines as immutable law and that, sometimes, they need to apply them with nuances, I do not consider that, in this case, the immigration officer fettered her discretion. Considering the generic nature of the information provided by the applicant, it was reasonable for her to require details from the applicant's employer about his specific duties as a pilot. Furthermore, the applicant offered no excuse for failing to provide the information and documents requested of him; he did not allege that it was impossible for him to obtain the requested information from his employer, nor did he provide any other explanation.",
    "[25]\nIn conclusion, considering the generic nature of the evidence on file and the applicant's failure to provide the documentation and information requested, I find that it was reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that she was not satisfied that the applicant had established that he had performed the main duties of a pilot. The immigration officer's reasons are clear and reasonable and the outcome falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47). The parties did not propose any question for certification and none arise in this case.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[26]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur est un citoyen d'Oman. Il a présenté une demande de visa de résident permanent au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Sa demande a été rejetée le 4 avril 2011 parce que l'agente d'immigration qui a rendu la décision a estimé qu'il n'avait pas fourni suffisamment de détails concernant son emploi. [2]\nLa Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de cette décision, présentée conformément à l'article 72 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001, c 27. Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, la demande est rejetée.\nI.\nLe contexte [3]\nLe demandeur a présenté une demande de résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) le 17 septembre 2007. Il a inclus son épouse et son enfant dans sa demande. [4]\nIl a déclaré dans sa demande qu'il était à l'emploi de Gulf Air comme pilote. Dans la classification nationale des professions (CNP), la profession de pilote est classée sous le code CNP 2271 et est considérée comme appartenant à la catégorie correspondant au niveau de compétence B. [5]\nLe 1er mars 2010, le Haut-commissariat du Canada à Londres a envoyé une lettre au demandeur dans laquelle on l'informait que sa demande était transférée au Centre de traitement des demandes pilote à Ottawa, dans le cadre du Plan d'action du gouvernement du Canada pour accélérer l'immigration mis en uvre pour diminuer le temps de traitement de certains types de demandes. Dans la lettre, on demandait également au demandeur plusieurs documents, dont un formulaire de demande de visa à jour et des documents visant à démontrer son expérience de travail. En ce qui a trait à ces derniers documents, la lettre précisait ce qui suit:\n[traduction]\nVeuillez fournir les lettres d'emploi, les contrats, les bordereaux de paie et les\ndescriptions d'emploi approuvés par le service du personnel de votre employeur\npour la période de dix ans qui précède la date de votre demande.\nVeuillez vous assurer que les lettres d'emploi décrivent vos fonctions en détail\net qu'elles contiennent les dates précises du début et de la fin (le cas échéant) de votre période d'emploi. Le CTDP-O n'est pas tenu de demander à nouveau des lettres d'emploi détaillées, et l'examen de votre expérience de travail sera fondé uniquement sur la documentation fournie initialement. [Non souligné dans l'original.] [6]\nEn juillet 2010, le demandeur a présenté plusieurs documents, dont une lettre de son employeur, Gulf Air, datée du 21 juin 2010, attestant qu'il était à l'emploi de Gulf Air depuis le 21 juin 1992. La lettre déclarait que le demandeur travaillait comme commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. [7]\nÀ l'annexe 3 de sa demande mise à jour, le demandeur a indiqué, dans la partie ayant trait à son expérience de travail, qu'il était employé comme pilote depuis le mois d'avril 1992, et il a décrit comme suit ses fonctions principales:\na. piloter des avions pour assurer le transport des passagers et des marchandises pour les lignes aériennes Gulf;\nb. diriger le travail de l'équipage à titre de commandant de bord;\nc. servir de copilote et remplacer le commandant de bord à titre de premier officier;\nd. enseigner aux pilotes à se servir du nouvel équipement.\nII.\nLa décision contrôlée [8]\nL'agente d'immigration a estimé que le demandeur ne répondait pas à la définition de travailleur qualifié (fédéral) prévue aux alinéas 75(2)\nb\n) et\nc\n) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nDORS/2002-227 [le Règlement]. Elle a indiqué qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur satisfaisait aux exigences du Règlement parce qu'il n'avait pas fourni suffisamment de détails sur son emploi, comme cela lui était demandé. Elle a expliqué comme suit son raisonnement:\n[traduction]\n[...] La confirmation d'emploi de Gulf Air ne comporte aucune description de travail et aucune description des tâches exécutées dans le cadre du poste. Le document fourni par votre employeur ne contient pas suffisamment de renseignements pour me convaincre que vous avez accompli les fonctions principales du poste décrit. Dans une lettre datée du 11 mars 2010 que vous a envoyée notre bureau de Londres, il vous a été demandé de fournir la documentation sur votre expérience de travail, dont le détail de vos fonctions. Vous avez été averti dans ce même courriel que, si vous ne fournissiez pas ces documents, votre demande serait évaluée sur le fondement de la documentation initialement fournie. Après examen de tous les documents fournis, je ne suis pas convaincue que vous avez exécuté l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal de la CNP, ni que vous avez exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales du poste décrites dans la CNP. En conséquence, je ne suis pas convaincue que vous satisfaites aux exigences minimales pour présenter une demande à titre de travailleur qualifié au sens de l'article 75 du Règlement.\nIII.\nLa question en litige [9]\nLa présente affaire soulève la question du caractère raisonnable de la décision de l'agente d'immigration.\nIV.\nLa norme de contrôle [10]\nIl est bien établi que les décisions rendues par des agents d'immigration relativement à l'admissibilité à la résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) impliquent l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire et appellent la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) [\nMihura Torres\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 247;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 153;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) [\nMalik\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)). [11]\nLe rôle de la Cour, lors du contrôle d'une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, est défini comme suit dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [47] [...] La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.\nV.\nAnalyse [12]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agente d'immigration a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire en s'appuyant sur les directives ministérielles mentionnées dans la lettre du 11 mars 2010. Il allègue en outre que l'agente d'immigration a rejeté sa demande pour le seul motif qu'il n'avait pas fourni une lettre d'employeur qui décrivait les fonctions principales de son emploi comme pilote. Cependant, les textes législatifs et règlementaires ne précisent pas le moyen par lequel le demandeur doit établir qu'il a exercé les fonctions principales d'une profession et ne requièrent pas expressément des lettres d'employeurs comprenant des descriptions de travail. En conséquence, le demandeur fait valoir que la décision de l'agente d'immigration était déraisonnable. [13]\nLe demandeur soutient en outre qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de conclure qu'il n'avait pas établi de manière satisfaisante ses fonctions principales à titre de pilote pour Gulf Air. Il fait valoir avec insistance que sa crédibilité n'a pas été mise en question en l'espèce et que la preuve qu'il a présentée établissait clairement quelles étaient ses fonctions principales comme pilote. En premier lieu, soutient-il, les fonctions précises de l'emploi de pilote, et plus particulièrement de commandant, sont évidentes et l'agente d'immigration devrait savoir ce qu'elles sont. En deuxième lieu, le demandeur affirme que la description de ses fonctions principales à l'annexe 3 ainsi que la lettre de confirmation fournie par l'employeur suffisaient pour établir qu'il travaillait réellement comme pilote pour Gulf Air et aussi à établir les fonctions qu'il exerçait dans le cadre de son emploi. [14]\nLe défendeur soutient quant à lui qu'il incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences d'admissibilité au Canada en tant que travailleur qualifié (fédéral) et que la demande de lettres détaillées d'employeurs pour les dix dernières années était expressément formulée dans la lettre qui lui avait été envoyée le 11 mars 2010. Le défendeur ajoute que, étant donné le défaut du demandeur de fournir la documentation exigée, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de parvenir aux conclusions exposées. [15]\nLe défendeur soutient en outre qu'aucun des documents fournis par le demandeur ne dresse la liste des fonctions principales de son emploi comme pilote ni ne fournit une description de travail. Le défendeur fait valoir que le demandeur a simplement copié et collé les fonctions d'emploi de la CNP 2271 dans son formulaire figurant à l'annexe 3 et que cela n'était pas suffisant pour lui remettre de s'acquitter du fardeau de la preuve qui lui incombait. Au contraire, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration d'exiger une preuve objective provenant de l'employeur du demandeur. Sans cette preuve, l'agente d'immigration était dans l'impossibilité de déterminer si les antécédents professionnels du demandeur du demandeur étaient pertinents relativement aux fonctions décrites dans la CNP 2271 et cela suffisait pour justifier la conclusion que le demandeur n'était pas admissible à l'immigration au Canada en vertu du paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement.\nVI.\nAnalyse [16]\nLe travailleur qualifié (fédéral) est défini comme suit au paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement:\n(2) Est un travailleur qualifié l'étranger qui satisfait aux exigences suivantes:\na\n) il a accumulé au moins une année continue d'expérience de travail à temps plein au sens du paragraphe 80(7), ou l'équivalent s'il travaille à temps partiel de façon continue, au cours des dix années qui ont précédé la date de présentation de la demande de visa de résident permanent, dans au moins une des professions appartenant aux genre de compétence 0 Gestion ou niveaux de compétences A ou B de la matrice de la\nClassification nationale des professions -\nexception faite des professions d'accès limité;\nb) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification;\nc) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession figurant dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification, notamment toutes les fonctions essentielles.\n(2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if\n(\na\n) within the 10 years preceding the date of their application for a permanent resident visa, they have at least one year of continuous full-time employment experience, as described in subsection 80(7), or the equivalent in continuous part-time employment in one or more occupations, other than a restricted occupation, that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the\nNational Occupational Classification\nmatrix;\n(\nb\n) during that period of employment they performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n; and\n(\nc\n) during that period of employment they performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n, including all of the essential duties.. [17]\nSelon cette disposition, le ressortissant étranger doit avoir eu un emploi à temps plein pendant au moins un an, ou l'équivalent au cours des dix années antérieures, dans un ou plusieurs types de professions. De plus, l'intéressé doit avoir accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession en question dans la CNP, ainsi qu'une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énoncées dans la CNP. Cette exigence répond à la nécessité de veiller à ce que les fonctions qu'un demandeur a accomplies dans le cadre d'un poste dans son pays d'origine correspondent aux fonctions établies pour la même profession au Canada. [18]\nIl incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu' il avait exécuté, au cours des dix années précédentes, l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession de pilote dans la CNP 2271 et qu'il avait accompli une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de cette profession pendant au moins un an (décision\nMihura Torres\n, précitée, au paragraphe 37;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 858). Il incombe au demandeur de fournir suffisamment de documents justificatifs et de preuves et il doit présenter la meilleure preuve possible (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 355; décision\nMihura Torres\n, précitée, au paragraphe 40). L'agent d'immigration n'est nullement tenu de requérir des précisions du demandeur s'il conclut que la preuve initialement présentée est insuffisante (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)). [19]\nPour évaluer l'admissibilité, les agents d'immigration ont besoin de suffisamment de renseignements pour pouvoir apprécier l'expérience de travail du demandeur. Il leur faut également vérifier l'exhaustivité et l'exactitude des renseignements que les demandeurs présentent à l'appui de leur demande. En ce sens, il est, en règle générale, raisonnable d'exiger des demandeurs qu'ils fournissent des informations provenant de tiers, par exemple des lettres d'employeurs comportant des précisions sur les fonctions des demandeurs et/ou des descriptions de travail (décision\nMalik,\nprécitée, au paragraphe 33). Ces types de documents permettent aux agents d'immigration de se faire un tableau complet des fonctions et des responsabilités du demandeur et de déterminer si les fonctions accomplies par cette personne dans son pays d'origine sont similaires à celles figurant dans la description canadienne de la profession donnée. Dans certains cas, les informations présentées par des employeurs servent aussi à confirmer que le demandeur a véritablement accompli les tâches et les fonctions qu'il prétend avoir accomplies. [20]\nEn l'espèce, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté de son fardeau de preuve. [21]\nPremièrement, dans la description qu'il a donnée de ses fonctions, le demandeur s'est limité à réitérer les fonctions principales d'un pilote décrites dans la CNP, sans fournir d'autres détails sur ces fonctions. Le demandeur prie la Cour d'inférer, sur le fondement de ces renseignements très génériques qu'il a présentés, qu'une personne employée comme commandant par Gulf Air accomplit les mêmes fonctions que celles décrites dans la CNP 2271. À mon avis, il n'appartient ni à l'agent d'immigration, ni à la Cour de tirer cette inférence. Comme nous l'avons mentionné précédemment, il incombe au demandeur d'établir qu'il satisfait aux critères qui s'appliquent à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) et il ne l'a pas fait, en dépit d'instructions très précises sur les types de documents requis. À mon avis, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté du fardeau de présentation qui lui incombait aux termes du paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement, car il n'a pas fourni suffisamment de renseignements sur les fonctions et les responsabilités de son emploi. [22]\nDeuxièmement, il ne fait pas de doute que la lettre de l'employeur du demandeur ne contenait pas tous les renseignements qui avaient été clairement demandés par l'agente d'immigration dans la lettre datée du 11 mars 2010. La lettre de l'employeur indique seulement que le demandeur est employé comme commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. La lettre ne dit rien sur les fonctions et les responsabilités exercées par un commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. En fait, la lettre de l'employeur ne comporte même pas de renseignement sur les activités d'Air Gulf ou de sa flotte. [23]\nLe demandeur soutient que les fonctions d'un pilote sont évidentes et que l'agente d'immigration doit savoir ce qu'elles sont. Cet argument requiert que l'agente d'immigration suppose qu'un pilote à l'emploi de Gulf Air accomplit les fonctions décrites dans la CNP 2271. Avec respect, l'agent d'immigration ne doit pas déterminer si l'expérience de travail d'un demandeur correspond à l'énoncé principal et aux fonctions principales de la CNP pour une profession, en se fondant sur sa connaissance personnelle de la profession ou sur la connaissance personnelle que le demandeur lui prête. Les agents d'immigration doivent apprécier les demandes en se fondant sur les preuves présentées par les demandeurs et non sur leurs connaissances personnelles ou sur leurs suppositions. À mon avis, c'est la seule méthode rigoureuse, juste et cohérente pour déterminer si un demandeur a accompli les fonctions principales d'un poste décrit dans la CNP. [24]\nEnfin, le demandeur reproche à l'agente d'immigration de s'être appuyée sur des directives générales et soutient que, en faisant cela, elle a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Je ne suis pas d'accord. J'ai déjà déclaré qu'il est raisonnable d'exiger des renseignements des employeurs des demandeurs sur les fonctions précises d'une profession. Quoique je reconnaisse que les agents d'immigration ne peuvent pas traiter des directives administratives comme une loi immuable et qu'ils doivent, parfois, les appliquer avec des nuances, je n'estime pas que, dans la présente affaire, l'agente d'immigration a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Étant donné le caractère générique des renseignements présentés par le demandeur, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'exiger des détails de l'employeur du demandeur sur les fonctions précises du demandeur à titre de pilote. De plus, le demandeur n'a présenté aucune excuse pour ne pas avoir fourni les renseignements et les documents qui lui étaient demandés. Il n'a pas allégué qu'il lui était impossible d'obtenir de son employeur les renseignements requis et il n'a fourni aucune autre explication. [25]\nEn conclusion, considérant le caractère générique des renseignements au dossier et le défaut du demandeur de fournir la documentation et les renseignements demandés, j'estime qu'il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de conclure qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur avait établi qu'il avait accompli les fonctions principales d'un pilote. Les motifs de l'agente d'immigration sont clairs et raisonnables et la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (arrêt\nDunsmuir,\nprécité, au paragraphe 47). Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question aux fins de certification et l'affaire n'en soulève aucune.\nJUGEMENT [26]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.\n[End of document]"

Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2012] F.T.R. TBEd. AP.019.\n[1]\nBédard, J.\n: The applicant is a citizen of Oman. He filed an application for a permanent resident visa to Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class. His application was refused on April 4, 2011, because the adjudicating immigration officer found that he provided insufficient details about his employment.\n[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review of that decision pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27. For the following reasons the application is dismissed.\nI.\nBackground\n[3]\nThe applicant submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class on September 17, 2007. He included his wife and child in his application.\n[4]\nHe stated in his application that he was employed as a pilot for Gulf Air. According to the National Occupation Classification (NOC), the occupation of pilot is classified under NOC 2271 and categorized under Skill Level B.\n[5]\nOn March 11, 2010, the High Commission of Canada in London sent a letter to the applicant informing him that his application was being transferred to the Case Processing Pilot in Ottawa, as part of the Government of Canada's Action Plan for Faster Immigration, implemented to expedite processing times for certain types of applications. This letter also requested several documents from the applicant, including an updated visa application form and documents substantiating his work experience. With respect to the latter, the letter specified the following:\nProvide employment letters, contracts, pay-slips and\njob descriptions endorsed by your employer's personnel department\ncovering the period from 10 years prior to your application date until today.\nPlease make sure that the employment letters have details of your duties\nand clearly show the start and end dates (if relevant) of your employment. CPP-O is under no obligation to further request detailed employment letters, and your work experience review will be based solely on the documents initially provided.\n[Emphasis added]\n[6]\nIn July 2010, the applicant submitted several documents, including a letter from his employer, Gulf Air, dated June 21, 2010, attesting that he had been employed by Gulf Air since April 19, 1992. The letter stated that the applicant works as a captain in the Airbus Fleet Management.\n[7]\nIn Schedule 3 of his updated application, the applicant indicated, in the section dealing with work experience, that he had been employed as a pilot since April 1992, and he described his main duties as follows:\na. Fly aircrafts fro [\nsic\n] Gulf airlines to transport passengers and freight;\nb. Direct activities of aircraft crew during flight, as captain of aircraft\nc. Co-pilot aircraft and perform captain's duties of required, as first officer\nd. Train pilots to use new equipment\nII.\nThe decision under review\n[8]\nThe immigration officer decided that the applicant did not meet the definition of a Federal Skilled Worker pursuant to paragraphs 75(2)(\nb\n) and (\nc\n) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SORS/2002-227 [the Regulations]. The immigration officer indicated that she was not satisfied that the applicant met the requirements of the Regulations because he failed to provide sufficient details about his employment, as requested. The immigration officer explained her reasoning as follows:\n. . . The employment confirmation from Gulf Air did not give any job description or a description of the duties performed for the position. There is insufficient information on the document provided by your employer to satisfy me that you have performed the main duties of the position described. You were asked, by letter from our London office dated March 11, 2010, to provide your work experience documents, including details of your duties. That same email informed you that failure to provide these documents would result in an assessment of your application based on the documents initially on file. After reviewing all documents provided, I am not satisfied you have performed the actions as set out in the lead statements of the NOC stated, and that you have performed a substantial number of the main duties of the position as described in the NOC. As a result, I am not satisfied that you meet the minimum requirements to apply as a skilled worker as stated in R75.\nIII.\nIssue\n[9]\nThis case raises the issue of the reasonableness of the immigration officer's decision.\nIV.\nStandard of review\n[10]\nIt is well established that decisions made by immigration officers regarding applicants' eligibility for permanent residence in Canada as members of the Federal Skilled Worker class involve an exercise of discretion and attract the reasonableness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [\nMihura Torres\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 247;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 153;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [\nMalik\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[47] . . . A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\nV.\nAnalysis\n[12]\nThe applicant argues that the immigration officer fettered her discretion by relying on departmental guidelines, as they are outlined in the March 11, 2010 letter. The applicant further alleges that the immigration officer refused his application solely on the basis that he did not provide an employer's letter that described the main duties of his job as a pilot. However, the legislation and the Regulations do not specify the means by which one must establish that an applicant exercises the main duties of an occupation and do not specifically require employers' letters that include job descriptions. Accordingly, the applicant submits that the immigration officer's decision is unreasonable.\n[13]\nThe applicant also argues that it was unreasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that he had not satisfactorily established his main duties as a pilot for Gulf Air. The applicant insists that there was no issue of credibility in his case and that the evidence he submitted clearly established his main duties as a pilot. First, he argues that the specific job duties of a pilot, and more particularly of a captain, are obvious and an immigration officer is expected to know what they are. Second, he alleges that the description of his main duties in Schedule 3, combined with the confirmation letter provided by his employer, was sufficient to establish that he genuinely works as a pilot for Gulf Air and was also sufficient to establish his job duties.\n[14]\nThe respondent argues, for his part, that the onus was on the applicant to establish that he met the requirements to be admitted to Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker and that the request to submit detailed employers' letters for the past 10 years, was explicitly outlined in the letter sent to him on March 11, 2010. The respondent argues that considering that the applicant did not submit the documentation that was required of him, it was reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude as she did.\n[15]\nThe respondent further argues that none of the documents provided by the applicant list the main duties of his work as a pilot, nor do they provide a job description. The respondent contends that the applicant simply copied and pasted the job duties from NOC 2271 to his Schedule 3 form and that this was not enough to satisfy his burden of proof. Rather, it was reasonable for the immigration officer to expect objective evidence from the applicant's employer. Without this evidence, the immigration officer was unable to assess whether the applicant had experience relevant to the duties outlined in NOC 2271 and this was sufficient to justify the finding that the applicant was ineligible for immigration to Canada pursuant to subsection 75(2) of the Regulations.\nVI.\nDiscussion\n[16]\nA Federal Skilled Worker is defined at subsection 75(2) of the Regulations:\n(2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if\n(\na\n) within the 10 years preceding the date of their application for a permanent resident visa, they have at least one year of continuous full-time employment experience, as described in subsection 80(7), or the equivalent in continuous part-time employment in one or more occupations, other than a restricted occupation, that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the\nNational Occupational Classification\nmatrix;\n(\nb\n) during that period of employment they performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n; and\n(\nc\n) during that period of employment they performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n, including all of the essential duties..\n(2) Est un travailleur qualifié l'étranger qui satisfait aux exigences suivantes:\na\n) il a accumulé au moins une année continue d'expérience de travail à temps plein au sens du paragraphe 80(7), ou l'équivalent s'il travaille à temps partiel de façon continue, au cours des dix années qui ont précédé la date de présentation de la demande de visa de résident permanent, dans au moins une des professions appartenant aux genre de compétence 0 Gestion ou niveaux de compétences A ou B de la matrice de la\nClassification nationale des professions\n- exception faite des professions d'accès limité;\nb) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification;\nc) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession figurant dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification, notamment toutes les fonctions essentielles.\n[17]\nPursuant to this provision, a foreign national must have at least one year of full time employment, or the equivalent within the past ten years, in one or more of certain types of occupations. In addition, he or she must have performed the actions described in the lead statement set out in the NOC for the occupation in question, as well as a substantial number of the main duties set out in the NOC. This requirement is coherent with the need to ensure that the duties that an applicant performed for a position held in their country of origin, correspond to the Canadian duties of the same occupation.\n[18]\nThe onus was on the applicant to establish that, within the past ten years, he performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation of a pilot as set out in NOC 2271 and that he performed a substantial number of the main duties of this occupation for at least one year. (\nMihura  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 37;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 858). The applicant is responsible for supplying enough supporting documents and evidence and he must put his best case forward (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 355;\nMihura  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 40). The immigration officer is under no obligation to request further clarification from the applicant if he or she finds there is not enough evidence initially submitted (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII)).\n[19]\nIn order to evaluate admissibility, immigration officers need sufficient information to assess an applicant's job experience. They also need to verify the completeness and accuracy of the information that applicants submit with their application. In that sense, it is reasonable to require, as a general rule, that applicants provide corroborative third party information such as employers' letters that include details about the applicants' duties and /or job descriptions (\nMalik\n, above, at para 33). These types of documents provide immigration officers with a complete picture of an applicant's duties and responsibilities and allow them to determine whether the duties performed by an applicant in his or her country of origin are similar to the Canadian description of the given occupation. In some cases, the information provided by employers also serves to confirm that an applicant actually performed the actions and duties that he or she claims to have performed.\n[20]\nIn this case, the applicant did not meet his evidentiary burden.\n[21]\nFirst, in his description of his duties, the applicant limited himself to re-stating the main duties of a pilot as described in the NOC, without providing any further details about these duties. The applicant is asking the Court to infer, from this very generic information provided by the applicant, that a person employed as a captain for Gulf Air performs the same duties as those described in NOC 2271. In my view, it is neither for the immigration officer nor for the Court to make this inference. As mentioned above, the onus is on the applicant to establish that he meets the criteria as a Federal Skilled Worker and he failed to do so despite specific instructions on what types of documents are required. In my view, the applicant failed to meet the evidentiary burden required by subsection 75(2) of the Regulations because he did not provide sufficient information about his job duties and responsibilities.\n[22]\nSecond, there is no doubt that the letter from the applicant's employer did not contain all the information that was plainly required by the immigration officer in the letter dated March 11, 2010. The employer's letter states only that the applicant is employed as a captain in the Airbus Fleet Management. The letter is silent as to the duties and responsibilities carried out by a captain in Gulf Air's Airbus Fleet Management. In fact, the employer's letter does not even include information about the activities of Air Gulf or its fleet.\n[23]\nThe applicant argues that the duties of a pilot are obvious and that the immigration officer is expected to know what they are. This argument requires that the immigration officer assume that a pilot for Gulf Air performs the duties as described in NOC 2271. With respect, an immigration officer should not determine whether an applicant's work experience corresponds to the lead statement and main duties set out in the NOC for an occupation based on his personal knowledge of an occupation or on the personal knowledge that an applicant imputes to the immigration officer. Immigration officers must assess applications based on the evidence that applicants put forward and not on their own personal knowledge or assumptions. In my view, this is the only rigorous, fair, cohesive and coherent approach to assessing whether an applicant has performed the main duties of any position described in the NOC.\n[24]\nFinally, the applicant faults the immigration officer for having relied on a general guideline and argues that, in doing so, she fettered her discretion. I disagree. I have already stated that it is reasonable to require information from applicants' employers about the specific duties of an occupation. While I acknowledge that immigration officers cannot treat administrative guidelines as immutable law and that, sometimes, they need to apply them with nuances, I do not consider that, in this case, the immigration officer fettered her discretion. Considering the generic nature of the information provided by the applicant, it was reasonable for her to require details from the applicant's employer about his specific duties as a pilot. Furthermore, the applicant offered no excuse for failing to provide the information and documents requested of him; he did not allege that it was impossible for him to obtain the requested information from his employer, nor did he provide any other explanation.\n[25]\nIn conclusion, considering the generic nature of the evidence on file and the applicant's failure to provide the documentation and information requested, I find that it was reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that she was not satisfied that the applicant had established that he had performed the main duties of a pilot. The immigration officer's reasons are clear and reasonable and the outcome falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47). The parties did not propose any question for certification and none arise in this case.\nJUDGMENT\n[26]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur est un citoyen d'Oman. Il a présenté une demande de visa de résident permanent au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Sa demande a été rejetée le 4 avril 2011 parce que l'agente d'immigration qui a rendu la décision a estimé qu'il n'avait pas fourni suffisamment de détails concernant son emploi.\n[2]\nLa Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de cette décision, présentée conformément à l'article 72 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001, c 27. Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, la demande est rejetée.\nI.\nLe contexte\n[3]\nLe demandeur a présenté une demande de résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) le 17 septembre 2007. Il a inclus son épouse et son enfant dans sa demande.\n[4]\nIl a déclaré dans sa demande qu'il était à l'emploi de Gulf Air comme pilote. Dans la classification nationale des professions (CNP), la profession de pilote est classée sous le code CNP 2271 et est considérée comme appartenant à la catégorie correspondant au niveau de compétence B.\n[5]\nLe 1er mars 2010, le Haut-commissariat du Canada à Londres a envoyé une lettre au demandeur dans laquelle on l'informait que sa demande était transférée au Centre de traitement des demandes pilote à Ottawa, dans le cadre du Plan d'action du gouvernement du Canada pour accélérer l'immigration mis en uvre pour diminuer le temps de traitement de certains types de demandes. Dans la lettre, on demandait également au demandeur plusieurs documents, dont un formulaire de demande de visa à jour et des documents visant à démontrer son expérience de travail. En ce qui a trait à ces derniers documents, la lettre précisait ce qui suit:\n[traduction]\nVeuillez fournir les lettres d'emploi, les contrats, les bordereaux de paie et les\ndescriptions d'emploi approuvés par le service du personnel de votre employeur\npour la période de dix ans qui précède la date de votre demande.\nVeuillez vous assurer que les lettres d'emploi décrivent vos fonctions en détail\net qu'elles contiennent les dates précises du début et de la fin (le cas échéant) de votre période d'emploi. Le CTDP-O n'est pas tenu de demander à nouveau des lettres d'emploi détaillées, et l'examen de votre expérience de travail sera fondé uniquement sur la documentation fournie initialement. [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[6]\nEn juillet 2010, le demandeur a présenté plusieurs documents, dont une lettre de son employeur, Gulf Air, datée du 21 juin 2010, attestant qu'il était à l'emploi de Gulf Air depuis le 21 juin 1992. La lettre déclarait que le demandeur travaillait comme commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus.\n[7]\nÀ l'annexe 3 de sa demande mise à jour, le demandeur a indiqué, dans la partie ayant trait à son expérience de travail, qu'il était employé comme pilote depuis le mois d'avril 1992, et il a décrit comme suit ses fonctions principales:\na. piloter des avions pour assurer le transport des passagers et des marchandises pour les lignes aériennes Gulf;\nb. diriger le travail de l'équipage à titre de commandant de bord;\nc. servir de copilote et remplacer le commandant de bord à titre de premier officier;\nd. enseigner aux pilotes à se servir du nouvel équipement.\nII.\nLa décision contrôlée\n[8]\nL'agente d'immigration a estimé que le demandeur ne répondait pas à la définition de travailleur qualifié (fédéral) prévue aux alinéas 75(2)\nb\n) et\nc\n) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nDORS/2002-227 [le Règlement]. Elle a indiqué qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur satisfaisait aux exigences du Règlement parce qu'il n'avait pas fourni suffisamment de détails sur son emploi, comme cela lui était demandé. Elle a expliqué comme suit son raisonnement:\n[traduction]\n[...] La confirmation d'emploi de Gulf Air ne comporte aucune description de travail et aucune description des tâches exécutées dans le cadre du poste. Le document fourni par votre employeur ne contient pas suffisamment de renseignements pour me convaincre que vous avez accompli les fonctions principales du poste décrit. Dans une lettre datée du 11 mars 2010 que vous a envoyée notre bureau de Londres, il vous a été demandé de fournir la documentation sur votre expérience de travail, dont le détail de vos fonctions. Vous avez été averti dans ce même courriel que, si vous ne fournissiez pas ces documents, votre demande serait évaluée sur le fondement de la documentation initialement fournie. Après examen de tous les documents fournis, je ne suis pas convaincue que vous avez exécuté l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal de la CNP, ni que vous avez exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales du poste décrites dans la CNP. En conséquence, je ne suis pas convaincue que vous satisfaites aux exigences minimales pour présenter une demande à titre de travailleur qualifié au sens de l'article 75 du Règlement.\nIII.\nLa question en litige\n[9]\nLa présente affaire soulève la question du caractère raisonnable de la décision de l'agente d'immigration.\nIV.\nLa norme de contrôle\n[10]\nIl est bien établi que les décisions rendues par des agents d'immigration relativement à l'admissibilité à la résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) impliquent l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire et appellent la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) [\nMihura Torres\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 247;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 153;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) [\nMalik\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)).\n[11]\nLe rôle de la Cour, lors du contrôle d'une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, est défini comme suit dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[47] [...] La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.\nV.\nAnalyse\n[12]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agente d'immigration a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire en s'appuyant sur les directives ministérielles mentionnées dans la lettre du 11 mars 2010. Il allègue en outre que l'agente d'immigration a rejeté sa demande pour le seul motif qu'il n'avait pas fourni une lettre d'employeur qui décrivait les fonctions principales de son emploi comme pilote. Cependant, les textes législatifs et règlementaires ne précisent pas le moyen par lequel le demandeur doit établir qu'il a exercé les fonctions principales d'une profession et ne requièrent pas expressément des lettres d'employeurs comprenant des descriptions de travail. En conséquence, le demandeur fait valoir que la décision de l'agente d'immigration était déraisonnable.\n[13]\nLe demandeur soutient en outre qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de conclure qu'il n'avait pas établi de manière satisfaisante ses fonctions principales à titre de pilote pour Gulf Air. Il fait valoir avec insistance que sa crédibilité n'a pas été mise en question en l'espèce et que la preuve qu'il a présentée établissait clairement quelles étaient ses fonctions principales comme pilote. En premier lieu, soutient-il, les fonctions précises de l'emploi de pilote, et plus particulièrement de commandant, sont évidentes et l'agente d'immigration devrait savoir ce qu'elles sont. En deuxième lieu, le demandeur affirme que la description de ses fonctions principales à l'annexe 3 ainsi que la lettre de confirmation fournie par l'employeur suffisaient pour établir qu'il travaillait réellement comme pilote pour Gulf Air et aussi à établir les fonctions qu'il exerçait dans le cadre de son emploi.\n[14]\nLe défendeur soutient quant à lui qu'il incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences d'admissibilité au Canada en tant que travailleur qualifié (fédéral) et que la demande de lettres détaillées d'employeurs pour les dix dernières années était expressément formulée dans la lettre qui lui avait été envoyée le 11 mars 2010. Le défendeur ajoute que, étant donné le défaut du demandeur de fournir la documentation exigée, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de parvenir aux conclusions exposées.\n[15]\nLe défendeur soutient en outre qu'aucun des documents fournis par le demandeur ne dresse la liste des fonctions principales de son emploi comme pilote ni ne fournit une description de travail. Le défendeur fait valoir que le demandeur a simplement copié et collé les fonctions d'emploi de la CNP 2271 dans son formulaire figurant à l'annexe 3 et que cela n'était pas suffisant pour lui remettre de s'acquitter du fardeau de la preuve qui lui incombait. Au contraire, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration d'exiger une preuve objective provenant de l'employeur du demandeur. Sans cette preuve, l'agente d'immigration était dans l'impossibilité de déterminer si les antécédents professionnels du demandeur du demandeur étaient pertinents relativement aux fonctions décrites dans la CNP 2271 et cela suffisait pour justifier la conclusion que le demandeur n'était pas admissible à l'immigration au Canada en vertu du paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement.\nVI.\nAnalyse\n[16]\nLe travailleur qualifié (fédéral) est défini comme suit au paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement:\n(2) Est un travailleur qualifié l'étranger qui satisfait aux exigences suivantes:\na\n) il a accumulé au moins une année continue d'expérience de travail à temps plein au sens du paragraphe 80(7), ou l'équivalent s'il travaille à temps partiel de façon continue, au cours des dix années qui ont précédé la date de présentation de la demande de visa de résident permanent, dans au moins une des professions appartenant aux genre de compétence 0 Gestion ou niveaux de compétences A ou B de la matrice de la\nClassification nationale des professions -\nexception faite des professions d'accès limité;\nb) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification;\nc) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession figurant dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification, notamment toutes les fonctions essentielles.\n(2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if\n(\na\n) within the 10 years preceding the date of their application for a permanent resident visa, they have at least one year of continuous full-time employment experience, as described in subsection 80(7), or the equivalent in continuous part-time employment in one or more occupations, other than a restricted occupation, that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the\nNational Occupational Classification\nmatrix;\n(\nb\n) during that period of employment they performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n; and\n(\nc\n) during that period of employment they performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n, including all of the essential duties..\n[17]\nSelon cette disposition, le ressortissant étranger doit avoir eu un emploi à temps plein pendant au moins un an, ou l'équivalent au cours des dix années antérieures, dans un ou plusieurs types de professions. De plus, l'intéressé doit avoir accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession en question dans la CNP, ainsi qu'une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énoncées dans la CNP. Cette exigence répond à la nécessité de veiller à ce que les fonctions qu'un demandeur a accomplies dans le cadre d'un poste dans son pays d'origine correspondent aux fonctions établies pour la même profession au Canada.\n[18]\nIl incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu' il avait exécuté, au cours des dix années précédentes, l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession de pilote dans la CNP 2271 et qu'il avait accompli une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de cette profession pendant au moins un an (décision\nMihura Torres\n, précitée, au paragraphe 37;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 858). Il incombe au demandeur de fournir suffisamment de documents justificatifs et de preuves et il doit présenter la meilleure preuve possible (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 355; décision\nMihura Torres\n, précitée, au paragraphe 40). L'agent d'immigration n'est nullement tenu de requérir des précisions du demandeur s'il conclut que la preuve initialement présentée est insuffisante (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)).\n[19]\nPour évaluer l'admissibilité, les agents d'immigration ont besoin de suffisamment de renseignements pour pouvoir apprécier l'expérience de travail du demandeur. Il leur faut également vérifier l'exhaustivité et l'exactitude des renseignements que les demandeurs présentent à l'appui de leur demande. En ce sens, il est, en règle générale, raisonnable d'exiger des demandeurs qu'ils fournissent des informations provenant de tiers, par exemple des lettres d'employeurs comportant des précisions sur les fonctions des demandeurs et/ou des descriptions de travail (décision\nMalik,\nprécitée, au paragraphe 33). Ces types de documents permettent aux agents d'immigration de se faire un tableau complet des fonctions et des responsabilités du demandeur et de déterminer si les fonctions accomplies par cette personne dans son pays d'origine sont similaires à celles figurant dans la description canadienne de la profession donnée. Dans certains cas, les informations présentées par des employeurs servent aussi à confirmer que le demandeur a véritablement accompli les tâches et les fonctions qu'il prétend avoir accomplies.\n[20]\nEn l'espèce, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté de son fardeau de preuve.\n[21]\nPremièrement, dans la description qu'il a donnée de ses fonctions, le demandeur s'est limité à réitérer les fonctions principales d'un pilote décrites dans la CNP, sans fournir d'autres détails sur ces fonctions. Le demandeur prie la Cour d'inférer, sur le fondement de ces renseignements très génériques qu'il a présentés, qu'une personne employée comme commandant par Gulf Air accomplit les mêmes fonctions que celles décrites dans la CNP 2271. À mon avis, il n'appartient ni à l'agent d'immigration, ni à la Cour de tirer cette inférence. Comme nous l'avons mentionné précédemment, il incombe au demandeur d'établir qu'il satisfait aux critères qui s'appliquent à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) et il ne l'a pas fait, en dépit d'instructions très précises sur les types de documents requis. À mon avis, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté du fardeau de présentation qui lui incombait aux termes du paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement, car il n'a pas fourni suffisamment de renseignements sur les fonctions et les responsabilités de son emploi.\n[22]\nDeuxièmement, il ne fait pas de doute que la lettre de l'employeur du demandeur ne contenait pas tous les renseignements qui avaient été clairement demandés par l'agente d'immigration dans la lettre datée du 11 mars 2010. La lettre de l'employeur indique seulement que le demandeur est employé comme commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. La lettre ne dit rien sur les fonctions et les responsabilités exercées par un commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. En fait, la lettre de l'employeur ne comporte même pas de renseignement sur les activités d'Air Gulf ou de sa flotte.\n[23]\nLe demandeur soutient que les fonctions d'un pilote sont évidentes et que l'agente d'immigration doit savoir ce qu'elles sont. Cet argument requiert que l'agente d'immigration suppose qu'un pilote à l'emploi de Gulf Air accomplit les fonctions décrites dans la CNP 2271. Avec respect, l'agent d'immigration ne doit pas déterminer si l'expérience de travail d'un demandeur correspond à l'énoncé principal et aux fonctions principales de la CNP pour une profession, en se fondant sur sa connaissance personnelle de la profession ou sur la connaissance personnelle que le demandeur lui prête. Les agents d'immigration doivent apprécier les demandes en se fondant sur les preuves présentées par les demandeurs et non sur leurs connaissances personnelles ou sur leurs suppositions. À mon avis, c'est la seule méthode rigoureuse, juste et cohérente pour déterminer si un demandeur a accompli les fonctions principales d'un poste décrit dans la CNP.\n[24]\nEnfin, le demandeur reproche à l'agente d'immigration de s'être appuyée sur des directives générales et soutient que, en faisant cela, elle a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Je ne suis pas d'accord. J'ai déjà déclaré qu'il est raisonnable d'exiger des renseignements des employeurs des demandeurs sur les fonctions précises d'une profession. Quoique je reconnaisse que les agents d'immigration ne peuvent pas traiter des directives administratives comme une loi immuable et qu'ils doivent, parfois, les appliquer avec des nuances, je n'estime pas que, dans la présente affaire, l'agente d'immigration a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Étant donné le caractère générique des renseignements présentés par le demandeur, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'exiger des détails de l'employeur du demandeur sur les fonctions précises du demandeur à titre de pilote. De plus, le demandeur n'a présenté aucune excuse pour ne pas avoir fourni les renseignements et les documents qui lui étaient demandés. Il n'a pas allégué qu'il lui était impossible d'obtenir de son employeur les renseignements requis et il n'a fourni aucune autre explication.\n[25]\nEn conclusion, considérant le caractère générique des renseignements au dossier et le défaut du demandeur de fournir la documentation et les renseignements demandés, j'estime qu'il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de conclure qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur avait établi qu'il avait accompli les fonctions principales d'un pilote. Les motifs de l'agente d'immigration sont clairs et raisonnables et la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (arrêt\nDunsmuir,\nprécité, au paragraphe 47). Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question aux fins de certification et l'affaire n'en soulève aucune.\nJUGEMENT\n[26]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.

Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2012] F.T.R. TBEd. AP.019.\n\n[1]\nBédard, J.\n: The applicant is a citizen of Oman. He filed an application for a permanent resident visa to Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class. His application was refused on April 4, 2011, because the adjudicating immigration officer found that he provided insufficient details about his employment.\n\n[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review of that decision pursuant to section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27. For the following reasons the application is dismissed.\nI.\nBackground\n\n[3]\nThe applicant submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class on September 17, 2007. He included his wife and child in his application.\n\n[4]\nHe stated in his application that he was employed as a pilot for Gulf Air. According to the National Occupation Classification (NOC), the occupation of pilot is classified under NOC 2271 and categorized under Skill Level B.\n\n[5]\nOn March 11, 2010, the High Commission of Canada in London sent a letter to the applicant informing him that his application was being transferred to the Case Processing Pilot in Ottawa, as part of the Government of Canada's Action Plan for Faster Immigration, implemented to expedite processing times for certain types of applications. This letter also requested several documents from the applicant, including an updated visa application form and documents substantiating his work experience. With respect to the latter, the letter specified the following:\nProvide employment letters, contracts, pay-slips and\njob descriptions endorsed by your employer's personnel department\ncovering the period from 10 years prior to your application date until today.\nPlease make sure that the employment letters have details of your duties\nand clearly show the start and end dates (if relevant) of your employment. CPP-O is under no obligation to further request detailed employment letters, and your work experience review will be based solely on the documents initially provided.\n[Emphasis added]\n\n[6]\nIn July 2010, the applicant submitted several documents, including a letter from his employer, Gulf Air, dated June 21, 2010, attesting that he had been employed by Gulf Air since April 19, 1992. The letter stated that the applicant works as a captain in the Airbus Fleet Management.\n\n[7]\nIn Schedule 3 of his updated application, the applicant indicated, in the section dealing with work experience, that he had been employed as a pilot since April 1992, and he described his main duties as follows:\na. Fly aircrafts fro [\nsic\n] Gulf airlines to transport passengers and freight;\nb. Direct activities of aircraft crew during flight, as captain of aircraft\nc. Co-pilot aircraft and perform captain's duties of required, as first officer\nd. Train pilots to use new equipment\nII.\nThe decision under review\n\n[8]\nThe immigration officer decided that the applicant did not meet the definition of a Federal Skilled Worker pursuant to paragraphs 75(2)(\nb\n) and (\nc\n) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SORS/2002-227 [the Regulations]. The immigration officer indicated that she was not satisfied that the applicant met the requirements of the Regulations because he failed to provide sufficient details about his employment, as requested. The immigration officer explained her reasoning as follows:\n. . . The employment confirmation from Gulf Air did not give any job description or a description of the duties performed for the position. There is insufficient information on the document provided by your employer to satisfy me that you have performed the main duties of the position described. You were asked, by letter from our London office dated March 11, 2010, to provide your work experience documents, including details of your duties. That same email informed you that failure to provide these documents would result in an assessment of your application based on the documents initially on file. After reviewing all documents provided, I am not satisfied you have performed the actions as set out in the lead statements of the NOC stated, and that you have performed a substantial number of the main duties of the position as described in the NOC. As a result, I am not satisfied that you meet the minimum requirements to apply as a skilled worker as stated in R75.\nIII.\nIssue\n\n[9]\nThis case raises the issue of the reasonableness of the immigration officer's decision.\nIV.\nStandard of review\n\n[10]\nIt is well established that decisions made by immigration officers regarding applicants' eligibility for permanent residence in Canada as members of the Federal Skilled Worker class involve an exercise of discretion and attract the reasonableness standard of review (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [\nMihura Torres\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 247;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 153;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII) [\nMalik\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [47] . . . A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\nV.\nAnalysis\n\n[11] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[12]\nThe applicant argues that the immigration officer fettered her discretion by relying on departmental guidelines, as they are outlined in the March 11, 2010 letter. The applicant further alleges that the immigration officer refused his application solely on the basis that he did not provide an employer's letter that described the main duties of his job as a pilot. However, the legislation and the Regulations do not specify the means by which one must establish that an applicant exercises the main duties of an occupation and do not specifically require employers' letters that include job descriptions. Accordingly, the applicant submits that the immigration officer's decision is unreasonable.\n\n[13]\nThe applicant also argues that it was unreasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that he had not satisfactorily established his main duties as a pilot for Gulf Air. The applicant insists that there was no issue of credibility in his case and that the evidence he submitted clearly established his main duties as a pilot. First, he argues that the specific job duties of a pilot, and more particularly of a captain, are obvious and an immigration officer is expected to know what they are. Second, he alleges that the description of his main duties in Schedule 3, combined with the confirmation letter provided by his employer, was sufficient to establish that he genuinely works as a pilot for Gulf Air and was also sufficient to establish his job duties.\n\n[14]\nThe respondent argues, for his part, that the onus was on the applicant to establish that he met the requirements to be admitted to Canada as a Federal Skilled Worker and that the request to submit detailed employers' letters for the past 10 years, was explicitly outlined in the letter sent to him on March 11, 2010. The respondent argues that considering that the applicant did not submit the documentation that was required of him, it was reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude as she did.\n\n[15]\nThe respondent further argues that none of the documents provided by the applicant list the main duties of his work as a pilot, nor do they provide a job description. The respondent contends that the applicant simply copied and pasted the job duties from NOC 2271 to his Schedule 3 form and that this was not enough to satisfy his burden of proof. Rather, it was reasonable for the immigration officer to expect objective evidence from the applicant's employer. Without this evidence, the immigration officer was unable to assess whether the applicant had experience relevant to the duties outlined in NOC 2271 and this was sufficient to justify the finding that the applicant was ineligible for immigration to Canada pursuant to subsection 75(2) of the Regulations.\nVI.\nDiscussion\n\n[16]\nA Federal Skilled Worker is defined at subsection 75(2) of the Regulations:\n(2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if\n(\nhas\n) within the 10 years preceding the date of their application for a permanent resident visa, they have at least one year of continuous full-time employment experience, as described in subsection 80(7), or the equivalent in continuous part-time employment in one or more occupations, other than a restricted occupation, that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the\nNational Occupational Classification\nmatrix;\n(\nb\n) during that period of employment they performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n; and\n(\nc\n) during that period of employment they performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n, including all of the essential duties..\n(2) A foreigner is a qualified worker who meets the following requirements:\nhas\n) he has accumulated at least one continuous year of full-time work experience within the meaning of subsection 80(7), or the equivalent if he works part-time continuously, during the ten years preceding the date of submission of the permanent resident visa application, in at least one of the professions belonging to skill type 0 Management or skill levels A or B of the matrix of the\nNational occupational classification\n- except for professions with limited access;\n(b) during this period of employment, he accomplished all of the tasks appearing in the main statement established for the profession in the descriptions of the professions of this classification;\n(c) during this period of employment, he performed an appreciable part of the main functions of the profession appearing in the descriptions of the professions of this classification, including all the essential functions.\n\n[17]\nPursuant to this provision, a foreign national must have at least one year of full time employment, or the equivalent within the past ten years, in one or more of certain types of occupations. In addition, he or she must have performed the actions described in the lead statement set out in the NOC for the occupation in question, as well as a substantial number of the main duties set out in the NOC. This requirement is coherent with the need to ensure that the duties that an applicant performed for a position held in their country of origin, correspond to the Canadian duties of the same occupation.\n\n[18]\nThe onus was on the applicant to establish that, within the past ten years, he performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation of a pilot as set out in NOC 2271 and that he performed a substantial number of the main duties of this occupation for at least one year. (\nMihura  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 37;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 858). The applicant is responsible for supplying enough supporting documents and evidence and he must put his best case forward (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 355;\nMihura  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 40). The immigration officer is under no obligation to request further clarification from the applicant if he or she finds there is not enough evidence initially submitted (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (available on CanLII)).\n\n[19]\nIn order to evaluate admissibility, immigration officers need sufficient information to assess an applicant's job experience. They also need to verify the completeness and accuracy of the information that applicants submit with their application. In that sense, it is reasonable to require, as a general rule, that applicants provide corroborative third party information such as employers' letters that include details about the applicants' duties and /or job descriptions (\nMalik\n, above, at para 33). These types of documents provide immigration officers with a complete picture of an applicant's duties and responsibilities and allow them to determine whether the duties performed by an applicant in his or her country of origin are similar to the Canadian description of the given occupation. In some cases, the information provided by employers also serves to confirm that an applicant actually performed the actions and duties that he or she claims to have performed.\n\n[20]\nIn this case, the applicant did not meet his evidentiary burden.\n\n[21]\nFirst, in his description of his duties, the applicant limited himself to re-stating the main duties of a pilot as described in the NOC, without providing any further details about these duties. The applicant is asking the Court to infer, from this very generic information provided by the applicant, that a person employed as a captain for Gulf Air performs the same duties as those described in NOC 2271. In my view, it is neither for the immigration officer nor for the Court to make this inference. As mentioned above, the onus is on the applicant to establish that he meets the criteria as a Federal Skilled Worker and he failed to do so despite specific instructions on what types of documents are required. In my view, the applicant failed to meet the evidentiary burden required by subsection 75(2) of the Regulations because he did not provide sufficient information about his job duties and responsibilities.\n\n[22]\nSecond, there is no doubt that the letter from the applicant's employer did not contain all the information that was plainly required by the immigration officer in the letter dated March 11, 2010. The employer's letter states only that the applicant is employed as a captain in the Airbus Fleet Management. The letter is silent as to the duties and responsibilities carried out by a captain in Gulf Air's Airbus Fleet Management. In fact, the employer's letter does not even include information about the activities of Air Gulf or its fleet.\n\n[23]\nThe applicant argues that the duties of a pilot are obvious and that the immigration officer is expected to know what they are. This argument requires that the immigration officer assume that a pilot for Gulf Air performs the duties as described in NOC 2271. With respect, an immigration officer should not determine whether an applicant's work experience corresponds to the lead statement and main duties set out in the NOC for an occupation based on his personal knowledge of an occupation or on the personal knowledge that an applicant imputes to the immigration officer. Immigration officers must assess applications based on the evidence that applicants put forward and not on their own personal knowledge or assumptions. In my view, this is the only rigorous, fair, cohesive and coherent approach to assessing whether an applicant has performed the main duties of any position described in the NOC.\n\n[24]\nFinally, the applicant faults the immigration officer for having relied on a general guideline and argues that, in doing so, she fettered her discretion. I disagree. I have already stated that it is reasonable to require information from applicants' employers about the specific duties of an occupation. While I acknowledge that immigration officers cannot treat administrative guidelines as immutable law and that, sometimes, they need to apply them with nuances, I do not consider that, in this case, the immigration officer fettered her discretion. Considering the generic nature of the information provided by the applicant, it was reasonable for her to require details from the applicant's employer about his specific duties as a pilot. Furthermore, the applicant offered no excuse for failing to provide the information and documents requested of him; he did not allege that it was impossible for him to obtain the requested information from his employer, nor did he provide any other explanation.\n\n[25]\nIn conclusion, considering the generic nature of the evidence on file and the applicant's failure to provide the documentation and information requested, I find that it was reasonable for the immigration officer to conclude that she was not satisfied that the applicant had established that he had performed the main duties of a pilot. The immigration officer's reasons are clear and reasonable and the outcome falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 47). The parties did not propose any question for certification and none arise in this case.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[26]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur est un citoyen d'Oman. Il a présenté une demande de visa de résident permanent au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Sa demande a été rejetée le 4 avril 2011 parce que l'agente d'immigration qui a rendu la décision a estimé qu'il n'avait pas fourni suffisamment de détails concernant son emploi. [2]\nLa Cour est saisie d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de cette décision, présentée conformément à l'article 72 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001, c 27. Pour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, la demande est rejetée.\nI.\nLe contexte [3]\nLe demandeur a présenté une demande de résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) le 17 septembre 2007. Il a inclus son épouse et son enfant dans sa demande. [4]\nIl a déclaré dans sa demande qu'il était à l'emploi de Gulf Air comme pilote. Dans la classification nationale des professions (CNP), la profession de pilote est classée sous le code CNP 2271 et est considérée comme appartenant à la catégorie correspondant au niveau de compétence B. [5]\nLe 1er mars 2010, le Haut-commissariat du Canada à Londres a envoyé une lettre au demandeur dans laquelle on l'informait que sa demande était transférée au Centre de traitement des demandes pilote à Ottawa, dans le cadre du Plan d'action du gouvernement du Canada pour accélérer l'immigration mis en uvre pour diminuer le temps de traitement de certains types de demandes. Dans la lettre, on demandait également au demandeur plusieurs documents, dont un formulaire de demande de visa à jour et des documents visant à démontrer son expérience de travail. En ce qui a trait à ces derniers documents, la lettre précisait ce qui suit:\n[traduction]\nVeuillez fournir les lettres d'emploi, les contrats, les bordereaux de paie et les\ndescriptions d'emploi approuvés par le service du personnel de votre employeur\npour la période de dix ans qui précède la date de votre demande.\nVeuillez vous assurer que les lettres d'emploi décrivent vos fonctions en détail\net qu'elles contiennent les dates précises du début et de la fin (le cas échéant) de votre période d'emploi. Le CTDP-O n'est pas tenu de demander à nouveau des lettres d'emploi détaillées, et l'examen de votre expérience de travail sera fondé uniquement sur la documentation fournie initialement. [Non souligné dans l'original.] [6]\nEn juillet 2010, le demandeur a présenté plusieurs documents, dont une lettre de son employeur, Gulf Air, datée du 21 juin 2010, attestant qu'il était à l'emploi de Gulf Air depuis le 21 juin 1992. La lettre déclarait que le demandeur travaillait comme commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. [7]\nÀ l'annexe 3 de sa demande mise à jour, le demandeur a indiqué, dans la partie ayant trait à son expérience de travail, qu'il était employé comme pilote depuis le mois d'avril 1992, et il a décrit comme suit ses fonctions principales:\na. piloter des avions pour assurer le transport des passagers et des marchandises pour les lignes aériennes Gulf;\nb. diriger le travail de l'équipage à titre de commandant de bord;\nc. servir de copilote et remplacer le commandant de bord à titre de premier officier;\nd. enseigner aux pilotes à se servir du nouvel équipement.\nII.\nLa décision contrôlée [8]\nL'agente d'immigration a estimé que le demandeur ne répondait pas à la définition de travailleur qualifié (fédéral) prévue aux alinéas 75(2)\nb\n) et\nc\n) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nDORS/2002-227 [le Règlement]. Elle a indiqué qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur satisfaisait aux exigences du Règlement parce qu'il n'avait pas fourni suffisamment de détails sur son emploi, comme cela lui était demandé. Elle a expliqué comme suit son raisonnement:\n[traduction]\n[...] La confirmation d'emploi de Gulf Air ne comporte aucune description de travail et aucune description des tâches exécutées dans le cadre du poste. Le document fourni par votre employeur ne contient pas suffisamment de renseignements pour me convaincre que vous avez accompli les fonctions principales du poste décrit. Dans une lettre datée du 11 mars 2010 que vous a envoyée notre bureau de Londres, il vous a été demandé de fournir la documentation sur votre expérience de travail, dont le détail de vos fonctions. Vous avez été averti dans ce même courriel que, si vous ne fournissiez pas ces documents, votre demande serait évaluée sur le fondement de la documentation initialement fournie. Après examen de tous les documents fournis, je ne suis pas convaincue que vous avez exécuté l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal de la CNP, ni que vous avez exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales du poste décrites dans la CNP. En conséquence, je ne suis pas convaincue que vous satisfaites aux exigences minimales pour présenter une demande à titre de travailleur qualifié au sens de l'article 75 du Règlement.\nIII.\nLa question en litige [9]\nLa présente affaire soulève la question du caractère raisonnable de la décision de l'agente d'immigration.\nIV.\nLa norme de contrôle [10]\nIl est bien établi que les décisions rendues par des agents d'immigration relativement à l'admissibilité à la résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) impliquent l'exercice d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire et appellent la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) [\nMihura Torres\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (3d) 247;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> FTR 153;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII) [\nMalik\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)). [11]\nLe rôle de la Cour, lors du contrôle d'une décision selon la norme de la décision raisonnable, est défini comme suit dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [47] [...] La cour de révision se demande dès lors si la décision et sa justification possèdent les attributs de la raisonnabilité. Le caractère raisonnable tient principalement à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel, ainsi qu'à l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit.\nV.\nAnalyse [12]\nLe demandeur soutient que l'agente d'immigration a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire en s'appuyant sur les directives ministérielles mentionnées dans la lettre du 11 mars 2010. Il allègue en outre que l'agente d'immigration a rejeté sa demande pour le seul motif qu'il n'avait pas fourni une lettre d'employeur qui décrivait les fonctions principales de son emploi comme pilote. Cependant, les textes législatifs et règlementaires ne précisent pas le moyen par lequel le demandeur doit établir qu'il a exercé les fonctions principales d'une profession et ne requièrent pas expressément des lettres d'employeurs comprenant des descriptions de travail. En conséquence, le demandeur fait valoir que la décision de l'agente d'immigration était déraisonnable. [13]\nLe demandeur soutient en outre qu'il était déraisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de conclure qu'il n'avait pas établi de manière satisfaisante ses fonctions principales à titre de pilote pour Gulf Air. Il fait valoir avec insistance que sa crédibilité n'a pas été mise en question en l'espèce et que la preuve qu'il a présentée établissait clairement quelles étaient ses fonctions principales comme pilote. En premier lieu, soutient-il, les fonctions précises de l'emploi de pilote, et plus particulièrement de commandant, sont évidentes et l'agente d'immigration devrait savoir ce qu'elles sont. En deuxième lieu, le demandeur affirme que la description de ses fonctions principales à l'annexe 3 ainsi que la lettre de confirmation fournie par l'employeur suffisaient pour établir qu'il travaillait réellement comme pilote pour Gulf Air et aussi à établir les fonctions qu'il exerçait dans le cadre de son emploi. [14]\nLe défendeur soutient quant à lui qu'il incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu'il satisfaisait aux exigences d'admissibilité au Canada en tant que travailleur qualifié (fédéral) et que la demande de lettres détaillées d'employeurs pour les dix dernières années était expressément formulée dans la lettre qui lui avait été envoyée le 11 mars 2010. Le défendeur ajoute que, étant donné le défaut du demandeur de fournir la documentation exigée, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de parvenir aux conclusions exposées. [15]\nLe défendeur soutient en outre qu'aucun des documents fournis par le demandeur ne dresse la liste des fonctions principales de son emploi comme pilote ni ne fournit une description de travail. Le défendeur fait valoir que le demandeur a simplement copié et collé les fonctions d'emploi de la CNP 2271 dans son formulaire figurant à l'annexe 3 et que cela n'était pas suffisant pour lui remettre de s'acquitter du fardeau de la preuve qui lui incombait. Au contraire, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration d'exiger une preuve objective provenant de l'employeur du demandeur. Sans cette preuve, l'agente d'immigration était dans l'impossibilité de déterminer si les antécédents professionnels du demandeur du demandeur étaient pertinents relativement aux fonctions décrites dans la CNP 2271 et cela suffisait pour justifier la conclusion que le demandeur n'était pas admissible à l'immigration au Canada en vertu du paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement.\nVI.\nAnalyse [16]\nLe travailleur qualifié (fédéral) est défini comme suit au paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement:\n(2) Est un travailleur qualifié l'étranger qui satisfait aux exigences suivantes:\na\n) il a accumulé au moins une année continue d'expérience de travail à temps plein au sens du paragraphe 80(7), ou l'équivalent s'il travaille à temps partiel de façon continue, au cours des dix années qui ont précédé la date de présentation de la demande de visa de résident permanent, dans au moins une des professions appartenant aux genre de compétence 0 Gestion ou niveaux de compétences A ou B de la matrice de la\nClassification nationale des professions -\nexception faite des professions d'accès limité;\nb) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification;\nc) pendant cette période d'emploi, il a exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession figurant dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification, notamment toutes les fonctions essentielles.\n(2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if\n(\na\n) within the 10 years preceding the date of their application for a permanent resident visa, they have at least one year of continuous full-time employment experience, as described in subsection 80(7), or the equivalent in continuous part-time employment in one or more occupations, other than a restricted occupation, that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the\nNational Occupational Classification\nmatrix;\n(\nb\n) during that period of employment they performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n; and\n(\nc\n) during that period of employment they performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the\nNational Occupational Classification\n, including all of the essential duties.. [17]\nSelon cette disposition, le ressortissant étranger doit avoir eu un emploi à temps plein pendant au moins un an, ou l'équivalent au cours des dix années antérieures, dans un ou plusieurs types de professions. De plus, l'intéressé doit avoir accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession en question dans la CNP, ainsi qu'une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énoncées dans la CNP. Cette exigence répond à la nécessité de veiller à ce que les fonctions qu'un demandeur a accomplies dans le cadre d'un poste dans son pays d'origine correspondent aux fonctions établies pour la même profession au Canada. [18]\nIl incombait au demandeur de démontrer qu' il avait exécuté, au cours des dix années précédentes, l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession de pilote dans la CNP 2271 et qu'il avait accompli une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de cette profession pendant au moins un an (décision\nMihura Torres\n, précitée, au paragraphe 37;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 858). Il incombe au demandeur de fournir suffisamment de documents justificatifs et de preuves et il doit présenter la meilleure preuve possible (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 355; décision\nMihura Torres\n, précitée, au paragraphe 40). L'agent d'immigration n'est nullement tenu de requérir des précisions du demandeur s'il conclut que la preuve initialement présentée est insuffisante (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 912;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (disponible sur CanLII)). [19]\nPour évaluer l'admissibilité, les agents d'immigration ont besoin de suffisamment de renseignements pour pouvoir apprécier l'expérience de travail du demandeur. Il leur faut également vérifier l'exhaustivité et l'exactitude des renseignements que les demandeurs présentent à l'appui de leur demande. En ce sens, il est, en règle générale, raisonnable d'exiger des demandeurs qu'ils fournissent des informations provenant de tiers, par exemple des lettres d'employeurs comportant des précisions sur les fonctions des demandeurs et/ou des descriptions de travail (décision\nMalik,\nprécitée, au paragraphe 33). Ces types de documents permettent aux agents d'immigration de se faire un tableau complet des fonctions et des responsabilités du demandeur et de déterminer si les fonctions accomplies par cette personne dans son pays d'origine sont similaires à celles figurant dans la description canadienne de la profession donnée. Dans certains cas, les informations présentées par des employeurs servent aussi à confirmer que le demandeur a véritablement accompli les tâches et les fonctions qu'il prétend avoir accomplies. [20]\nEn l'espèce, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté de son fardeau de preuve. [21]\nPremièrement, dans la description qu'il a donnée de ses fonctions, le demandeur s'est limité à réitérer les fonctions principales d'un pilote décrites dans la CNP, sans fournir d'autres détails sur ces fonctions. Le demandeur prie la Cour d'inférer, sur le fondement de ces renseignements très génériques qu'il a présentés, qu'une personne employée comme commandant par Gulf Air accomplit les mêmes fonctions que celles décrites dans la CNP 2271. À mon avis, il n'appartient ni à l'agent d'immigration, ni à la Cour de tirer cette inférence. Comme nous l'avons mentionné précédemment, il incombe au demandeur d'établir qu'il satisfait aux critères qui s'appliquent à la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) et il ne l'a pas fait, en dépit d'instructions très précises sur les types de documents requis. À mon avis, le demandeur ne s'est pas acquitté du fardeau de présentation qui lui incombait aux termes du paragraphe 75(2) du Règlement, car il n'a pas fourni suffisamment de renseignements sur les fonctions et les responsabilités de son emploi. [22]\nDeuxièmement, il ne fait pas de doute que la lettre de l'employeur du demandeur ne contenait pas tous les renseignements qui avaient été clairement demandés par l'agente d'immigration dans la lettre datée du 11 mars 2010. La lettre de l'employeur indique seulement que le demandeur est employé comme commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. La lettre ne dit rien sur les fonctions et les responsabilités exercées par un commandant, Gestion de la flotte d'Airbus. En fait, la lettre de l'employeur ne comporte même pas de renseignement sur les activités d'Air Gulf ou de sa flotte. [23]\nLe demandeur soutient que les fonctions d'un pilote sont évidentes et que l'agente d'immigration doit savoir ce qu'elles sont. Cet argument requiert que l'agente d'immigration suppose qu'un pilote à l'emploi de Gulf Air accomplit les fonctions décrites dans la CNP 2271. Avec respect, l'agent d'immigration ne doit pas déterminer si l'expérience de travail d'un demandeur correspond à l'énoncé principal et aux fonctions principales de la CNP pour une profession, en se fondant sur sa connaissance personnelle de la profession ou sur la connaissance personnelle que le demandeur lui prête. Les agents d'immigration doivent apprécier les demandes en se fondant sur les preuves présentées par les demandeurs et non sur leurs connaissances personnelles ou sur leurs suppositions. À mon avis, c'est la seule méthode rigoureuse, juste et cohérente pour déterminer si un demandeur a accompli les fonctions principales d'un poste décrit dans la CNP. [24]\nEnfin, le demandeur reproche à l'agente d'immigration de s'être appuyée sur des directives générales et soutient que, en faisant cela, elle a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Je ne suis pas d'accord. J'ai déjà déclaré qu'il est raisonnable d'exiger des renseignements des employeurs des demandeurs sur les fonctions précises d'une profession. Quoique je reconnaisse que les agents d'immigration ne peuvent pas traiter des directives administratives comme une loi immuable et qu'ils doivent, parfois, les appliquer avec des nuances, je n'estime pas que, dans la présente affaire, l'agente d'immigration a entravé l'exercice de son pouvoir discrétionnaire. Étant donné le caractère générique des renseignements présentés par le demandeur, il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'exiger des détails de l'employeur du demandeur sur les fonctions précises du demandeur à titre de pilote. De plus, le demandeur n'a présenté aucune excuse pour ne pas avoir fourni les renseignements et les documents qui lui étaient demandés. Il n'a pas allégué qu'il lui était impossible d'obtenir de son employeur les renseignements requis et il n'a fourni aucune autre explication. [25]\nEn conclusion, considérant le caractère générique des renseignements au dossier et le défaut du demandeur de fournir la documentation et les renseignements demandés, j'estime qu'il était raisonnable de la part de l'agente d'immigration de conclure qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur avait établi qu'il avait accompli les fonctions principales d'un pilote. Les motifs de l'agente d'immigration sont clairs et raisonnables et la décision appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit (arrêt\nDunsmuir,\nprécité, au paragraphe 47). Les parties n'ont proposé aucune question aux fins de certification et l'affaire n'en soulève aucune.\nJUGEMENT [26]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée. Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.\n[End of document]",
