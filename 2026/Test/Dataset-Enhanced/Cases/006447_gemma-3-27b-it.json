    "[0]\nI.\nINTRODUCTION",
    "[1]\nPhelan, J.\n: This is the continuation of the litigation regarding a decision of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [SSHRC] denying the Applicant a post-doctoral fellowship [Award Decision].",
    "[2]\nIn my decision cited as\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 367, the matter was adjourned to permit the production of the certified tribunal record [CTR], following which the parties were provided with an opportunity to update their submissions.\nThis is the judicial review of the Award Decision based upon a proper record.\nII.\nFACTS",
    "[3]\nThe facts were generally set out in the previous decision but are repeated here for completeness.",
    "[4]\nIn October 2010, the Applicant, Mr. Wheeldon, applied for a two-year post-doctoral fellowship from the SSHRC. The SSHRC is a federal agency created to promote and support post-secondary based research and training in humanities and social sciences. It annually awards scholarships and fellowships.",
    "[5]\nOn February 10, 2011, the Applicant was informed in the Award Decision that he had not been successful. There are three critical elements in each of the two categories upon which applicants are evaluated. The Applicant claims that there are actually 15 elements and each is, by the SSHRC's admission, weighted equally. The Award Decision gave the Applicant his scores for \"Track Record\" and \"Proposed Program of Work\".",
    "[6]\nIn response to questions from the Applicant about the assessment of applications, the SSHRC informed him that he could file an internal appeal. The grounds of such an appeal were limited to procedural error or factual error.",
    "[7]\nThe Applicant pursued the matter further, questioning the application process and requesting a copy of his file.",
    "[8]\nIn response to the request for his file, the Applicant received an administrative file but did not receive any file from the committee members who made the assessment of his application.",
    "[9]\nIn response to further questions from the Applicant, the SSHRC provided some data as to the number of complaints/appeals that were received by the SSHRC for post-doctoral fellowship funding since 2008 and confirmation that specific criteria was used by committee members in evaluating such applications for funding.",
    "[10]\nOn May 5, 2011, the Applicant formally appealed the scoring of his award application on the basis of procedural fairness in that he could not meaningfully understand the basis of the scoring.",
    "[11]\nThe Applicant's judicial review was based on inadequate reasons being a breach of procedural fairness.",
    "[12]\nFollowing the previous decision, the Applicant was provided with the CTR principally consisting of a spreadsheet which had contained the final total scores of the SSHRC's Post-doctoral Fellowship submissions for the 2011-2012 application cycle. The version provided to the Applicant was redacted to remove the names and sub-category scores of other candidates.",
    "[13]\nThe Applicant maintained his position that the record did not allow him to know the basis of the Award Decision. The complaint is in part that numeric scores not linked to criteria and sub-criteria are not sufficient for a proper review; in essence, that there is inadequate feedback. The Applicant also says that he cannot tell in what ways he can improve his proposal for future applications. He relies on\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 283 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], for the proposition that applicants deserve feedback to position themselves to compete in future grant competitions.",
    "[14]\nThe SSHRC allocates its awards based on the recommendations from selection committees who assess, score and rank applications through independent expert reviews. These selection committees are made up of university based researchers and, where appropriate, experts from outside the academic community. Each year between 350-400 Canadian and international scholars and experts volunteer to serve on these selection committees.",
    "[15]\nThe information governing the awards process is available to applicants both through SSHRC staff and on the internet. In the Frequently Asked Questions section, the following appears:\n... in view of the large number of applications, committee members are not asked to provide written appraisals of individual applications, nor is a record kept of consensus judgments about the strengths and weaknesses of individual applications.\n\"Frequently Asked Questions about the Application Process - Doctoral Awards\", online: Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council < http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/ funding-financement/apply-demande/faqs-questions_frequentes/doctoral_awards-bourses_de_doctorat-eng.aspx>.",
    "[16]\nSelection committee members submit preliminary scores and rank each application in accordance with a formula whose purpose is to distribute marks of a particular applicant in a way that is relative to other applicants in that year's competition. Only the top 20-25% of applications are recommended for funding. In the 2011-2012 competition, only 20% of the applications were funded.",
    "[17]\nIn the Award Decision, the Applicant received a brief statement about the process of selection, the fact that of 877 applications 175 were offered awards and the details of his marks; first, the Track Record mark, then the Program of Work mark and finally the total score.",
    "[18]\nThe critical issue in this judicial review is whether the Applicant was denied procedural fairness by reason of breach of legitimate expectations. The issue of the reasonableness of the decision is a secondary matter.\nIII.\nANALYSIS",
    "[19]\nOriginally the Applicant characterized the attack on the Award Decision as a breach of procedural fairness due to inadequate reasons - phrased as a stand alone right. With the decision in\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Applicant could not rely on inadequate reasons as a stand alone ground for judicial review.",
    "[20]\nThe standard of review in respect of procedural fairness is correctness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). To the extent that the decision itself is challenged, because of inadequate reasons, that issue is decided under the reasonableness standard of review analysis.",
    "[21]\nThe Applicant claims that he was entitled to a process and a result which gave him information on how he could improve his application for the future. He relies extensively on the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision at paragraphs 116-120 which refer to the legitimate expectations created by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [NSERC] Peer Review Manual that referred to \"constructive comments to applicants\" and that these comments were to serve a number of purposes including assisting research to improve future applications.",
    "[22]\nThe current case is distinguishable from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, because no such legitimate expectation was created. The SSHRC website explains that, unlike the NSERC policy, no comments are provided due to the large number of applications.\nSSHRC appreciates that unsuccessful applicants frequently seek information to help them improve a future application. Unfortunately, the large number of applications in each competition precludes selection committees from providing written explanations for the scores assigned and from making any comments on the application's standing in the competition. Therefore, for any given application, the only information available from the selection committee is the competition results and the score assigned. Competition results are not communicated by telephone or email.\n\"Notification of Competition Results: Fellowships and Scholarships\", online Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council: < http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/policies-politiques/ f_notification-b_avis-eng.aspx>",
    "[23]\nGiven that expressed disclaimer of the provision of comments, the Applicant cannot claim that he was denied some legitimate expectation. The evidence confirms that the Applicant received what he had been promised - a chance to be granted an award in accordance with an application process that was followed.",
    "[24]\nTo the extent that there is any issue of reasonableness of the decision not to provide comments or reasonableness of the mark given and denial of an award, the decision of the SSHRC is entitled to considerable deference by this Court.",
    "[25]\nIn applying the reasonableness standard of review in an academic context, it has been found that a high degree of deference is owed to the expertise of the decision-making body.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 932, aff'd in 2001 BCCA 722, 161 BCAC 276, leave to appeal to SCC refused 295 NR 199 (cited to QL), the BC Supreme Court made at least two comments worthy of repetition here.\n13\nWhere a senate committee makes a decision deferring to faculty on matters of academic judgment, it is my view that the court should accord high deference to such a decision. As will be seen, the underlying decision here was, at its heart, an exercise of academic judgment by faculty as to whether Mohl was able to successfully meet the standards required for his practicum. The significance of this will be apparent after consideration of the procedural issues raised by Mohl.\n[...]\n16\nIt seems to me that the question of reasonableness must be intertwined to a certain extent with the question of deference. In other words, the reasonableness of the finding must be considered having regard to the degree of deference to which the tribunal is entitled on the matter at issue.",
    "[26]\nThe same principles are applicable to the SSHRC decision. There is a rationale for the process, there is a knowledgeable body making a highly discretionary decision to which the Applicant has no right to a specific result and there is a clear result.",
    "[27]\nThis is not a situation in which a court would be justified to intervene. It is a matter about which the decision making body has far greater expertise.",
    "[28]\nThe Applicant, as can be seen from his amended relief, seeks to have the Court impose a process on SSHRC regarding the award procedures and to then submit that process for court review within one year. There is no basis for this Court engaging in that kind of remedy.",
    "[29]\nI can find no basis for disturbing the SSHRC Award Decision.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[30]\nTherefore, this judicial review will be dismissed with costs.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[31]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Gary W. McLaughlin/vnh"

        "The SSHRC provides information about the awards process through staff and online resources.",

        "Due to the large number of applications, committee members are not required to provide written appraisals or comments on individual applications.",

        "The SSHRC explicitly disclaims providing comments on applications due to the volume received.",
        "The decision not to provide comments was reasonable, and the SSHRC is entitled to deference.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court dismissed the applicant’s judicial review, finding no denial of procedural fairness. The initial claim of inadequate reasons as a standalone breach of procedural fairness was deemed unsustainable following the *Newfoundland* decision.",
      "The court determined the correct standard of review for procedural fairness is correctness, while the reasonableness standard applies to challenges to the decision itself. The core issue was framed as a breach of legitimate expectations, not simply inadequate reasoning.",
      "The court distinguished this case from *<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>* (the NSERC case) because SSHRC explicitly disclaimed providing comments on applications due to the high volume received, unlike NSERC’s policy of providing constructive feedback. This disclaimer negated any legitimate expectation of receiving detailed feedback.",
      "The court emphasized that the applicant received what was promised: a decision based on a defined application process. The SSHRC’s process of relative ranking and the limited funding availability (20%) were considered rational.",
      "The court applied a high degree of deference to SSHRC’s academic judgment, citing *<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ACWS (3d) 932*, affirming that courts should defer to expert bodies making discretionary decisions in academic contexts.",
      "The court reasoned that SSHRC’s process was rational, involved knowledgeable decision-makers, and lacked any entitlement to a specific outcome for the applicant. Intervention was therefore unjustified.",
      "The court rejected the applicant’s request to impose a new process on SSHRC and subject it to court review, finding no legal basis for such a remedy."
