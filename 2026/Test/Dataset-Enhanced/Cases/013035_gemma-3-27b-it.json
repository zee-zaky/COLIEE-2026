Sims, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.",
    "[1]\nvon Finckenstein, J.\n: The Applicant arrived in Canada under the Live-in Caregiver Program (\"LCP\") on November 25, 2002 from the Philippines. She has been trying to secure permanent resident status for herself, her husband and their 10 year old daughter. Her husband and daughter remain in the Philippines and she has been separated from them for approximately two years while she has worked in Canada.",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant worked for her sister from the day she arrived in Canada until March 31, 2003. The Applicant found a new employer and began working for Ms. Melinda and Mr. de Lara on April 14, 2003. She worked for them until February 28, 2004. Her work permit did not expire until April 13, 2004. In March of 2004, the Applicant found another employer, Ms. Grelish who registered her name with the Domestic Workers' Registry. Ms. Grelish then submitted her Application for Foreign Live-In Caregiver to Human Resources and Development Canada (\"HRDC\").",
    "[3]\nMs. Grelish did not, however, obtain a confirmation from HRDC because she did not put her home address on the application form. She also decided mid-way through the application process that the Applicant should work for her parents instead. In order for the Applicant to work for Ms. Grelish's father, it was necessary to re-register the Applicant's name with the Domestic Workers' Registry and submit a new Application for Foreign Live-In Caregiver to HRDC. When Mr. Grelish received a new confirmation letter from HRDC, the Applicant immediately sent in her application for a new work permit with a receipt for the $150.00 fee. When she sent in her application on June 23, 2004, her permit had been expired for 71 days.",
    "[4]\nShe received a letter from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (\"CIC\") dated July 24, 2004 that said her application for a work permit had been refused because she had not applied for restoration with the appropriate fees. CIC did not notify her during the two week period when she still could have submitted a restoration application that she could do so if she sent in the $200.00 restoration fee.",
    "[5]\nThe Applicant now seeks judicial review of that decision arguing that procedural fairness dictates that the Applicant should have been provided with an opportunity to perfect her application, i.e. apply for restoration of the temporary residence status as well as applying for renewal of the work permit, thereby extending her status under the LCP.",
    "[6]\nIt is undisputed that the standard of review for decisions of visa officers is reasonableness simpliciter (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[7]\nLive-in caregivers must first obtain a work visa to enter Canada and once in Canada on a work authorization, they are considered temporary residents. They can apply for permanent residence in Canada after they have worked for two years as live-in caregivers, within three years of their arrival in Canada.",
    "[8]\nA worker can extend their work permit by applying for an extension before the expiry of their term (see s. 181 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 (the \"Regulations\")). If an individual has lost their status, they can apply for a restoration of status within 90 days of the expiry of their term (see s. 182 of the Regulations).",
    "[9]\nAn applicant failing to obtain the extension has to return to her homeland and start the process all over again. No credit under the LCP will be given for time already spent in Canada. In addition, the time for processing in the Philippines for an application under the LCP program is about two years, thus sending a caregiver back, merely for failing to check a box and remit $200.00 is quite draconian.",
    "[10]\nThis case is nearly identical with  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where I stated at paragraph 29:\nApplying common sense to this process, the date of receipt of the application, i.e. May 25, 2004, should be considered the lock-in date. Clearly she did not know, (nor could she reasonably be expected to know from the Extension Booklet,) that she also had to apply for a restoration of status. The Applicant should have been advised to check Box D and to send another $200.00 all within 19 days (the time remaining in the 90 day grace period). This was all that was required. Instead, CIC mechanically applied section 12 of the Regulations, ruling the application out of time. In my view, this is neither consistent with common sense, nor with Choi, supra.",
    "[11]\nCoincidentally, in this case the application was also received on the 71st day of the 90-day grace period set out in s. 182 of the Regulations. Therefore, applying the reasoning of Lim, supra to this cases mutatis mutandis, June 23, 2004 should be considered the lock-in date. The Applicant did not know, (nor could she reasonably be expected to know from the Extension Booklet), that she also had to apply for a restoration of status. The Applicant should have been advised to check Box D and to send another $200.00, all within 19 days (the time remaining in the 90-day grace period). Common sense and consistency with Choi [1992] ICF 763 dictates proceeding in such a way.",
    "[12]\nAccordingly, this application will be allowed.\nORDER",
    "[13]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS\nthat the decision dated July 27, 2004, of the Vegreville Centre of CIC, is set aside. The matter is returned to the Vegreville Centre of CIC to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of paragraph 11 of the Reasons for Order above.\n[End of document]"

      "The court interpreted sections 181 and 182 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, noting that while extensions require application *before* expiry, restoration of status is available within 90 days *after* expiry. The core issue was the failure to inform the applicant of the restoration option.",
      "The court determined that the Applicant's application, received on the 71st day of the 90-day restoration period, should be considered a 'lock-in' date, meaning the application was effectively made within the allowable timeframe if the applicant had been properly informed of the restoration requirement.",
      "The court reasoned that the Applicant could not reasonably be expected to know she needed to apply for both an extension *and* restoration, particularly given the information available in the Extension Booklet. The court found it illogical to penalize the applicant with a complete loss of accrued time under the Live-in Caregiver Program for a relatively minor oversight (failing to check a box and pay a $200 fee).",
      "The court explicitly relied on its prior decision in *Lim* (a nearly identical case) and applied the same reasoning *mutatis mutandis*, emphasizing the importance of common sense and consistency with the *Choi* precedent.",
