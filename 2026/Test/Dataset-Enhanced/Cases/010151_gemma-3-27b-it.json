Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI.\nNature of the Matter and Background",
    "[1]\nBoswell, J.\n: The Applicants applied for permanent residence from within Canada and, claiming humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds under subsection 25(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [\nAct\n], asked for exemptions from any criteria of the\nAct\nwhich they did not satisfy. Their request was refused by a senior immigration officer [Officer] and they now seek judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nAct\n, asking the Court to set aside the Officer's decision and return the matter to a different officer for re-determination.",
    "[2]\nThe Applicants are a married couple from Mexico and their 10-year-old son; their daughter is not party to the H&C application because she is a Canadian citizen, having been born here in 2006 after the Applicants arrived in Canada on April 19, 2005.",
    "[3]\nAfter the authorized period of their admission to Canada ended, the Applicants lived here without status for several years and, eventually, the female Applicant was detected by immigration officials and removal orders were issued against the family on June 23, 2009. On the same day, the Applicants applied for refugee protection, claiming that they feared they would be abducted by criminals if they returned to Mexico. On March 30, 2011, the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] dismissed the Applicants' claims because it found they were not credible and did not subjectively fear persecution, and that the risk of abduction was generalized. A pre-removal risk assessment was also refused on September 13, 2011.",
    "[4]\nIn the meantime, the Applicants had applied for H&C consideration on August 22, 2011, saying that it would not be in the best interests of their children to remove them from Canada and that it would cause the Applicants hardship to disturb their establishment and expose them to the adverse country conditions in Mexico.\nII.\nDecision under Review",
    "[5]\nOn April 25, 2013, the Officer refused to grant the Applicants any exemptions from the requirements of the\nAct\n.",
    "[6]\nThe Officer dealt first with the Applicants' claims that they would suffer hardship because of adverse country conditions, particularly with regard to discrimination against women, crime, poverty, and corruption. The Officer accepted that, while all were serious problems in Mexico, there were mechanisms for victims of crime to obtain redress. As for the other adverse country conditions, the Officer determined that the Applicants had not proven that \"their personal circumstances are such that the general country conditions will directly affect them to a greater extent than the general population or that the general country conditions will cause a hardship for the applicants that is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.\" As the onus was on the Applicants, the Officer rejected this aspect of their claims.",
    "[7]\nThe Officer was not convinced that the Applicants' degree of establishment warranted relief. Although Mr. Figueroa Jiménez had said that he was employed in Canada for all but a few months since his arrival here, the Officer noted that there was only documentation to support employment since 2009. His wife, Mrs. Rodriguez Jiménez, had also claimed to have been employed as a cleaner for two years, but there was no documentation that that was the case. The Officer did accept, however, that she was involved in the community and that her volunteer work was appreciated. The Officer also accepted that the Applicants had made friends here, but noted that there was no proof that severing those relationships would cause any hardship. Furthermore, the Officer noted that during their time in Canada the Applicants \"have received due process in the refugee protection system and therefore a measure of establishment is expected to have occurred.\" Ultimately, the Officer was not satisfied that the Applicants \"have integrated into Canadian society to the extent that their departure would cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.\"",
    "[8]\nThe Officer then addressed the adult Applicants' claim that removal to Mexico would negatively affect their son, who was 8 years old at the time, and their daughter, who was then 7. The Officer observed that the best interests of these children was a significant factor which should be given substantial weight, but it was not determinative. Here, the children were doing well in school, but the Officer said that both children were still of an age where their lives revolved around their parents. There was also no evidence that they had developed \"relationships in Canada that if severed, would have a significant negative impact.\"",
    "[9]\nThe Applicants had also claimed that their children could be affected by crime and poverty and that their daughter could suffer from gender discrimination. With respect to crime, the Officer again said that the government was making serious efforts to protect its citizens. As for poverty and gender discrimination, the Officer noted that both of the adult Applicants were educated and employed in Mexico prior to their departure, and that Mrs. Rodriguez Jiménez had gone to university for two years. The Officer expected the children to have similar opportunities in Mexico, and said that: \"[w]hile I note that children may enjoy better economic and social opportunities in Canada, the evidence before me does not support that they will be denied education, health care or would be targeted for abuse, trafficking or kidnapping in Mexico.\"",
    "[10]\nThe Officer then noted that the children would probably need some time to adjust to life in Mexico, but said that it is \"reasonable that they have been exposed to the language and culture of Mexico through their parents.\" While they might miss the friends they have made in Canada, they will still be with their primary caregivers and may benefit from the support of their extended family in Mexico. The Officer therefore concluded that the Applicants \"have not established with objective documentary evidence that the best interest of the children in this application will be negatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted.\"",
    "[11]\nThe Officer further found that the Applicants could re-establish themselves in Mexico. Not only did they have reasonably transferable skills and employment experiences, but they also have family in Mexico who could likely support them emotionally.",
    "[12]\nThe Officer thus refused the application, noting that while the Applicants' desire to remain in Canada was understandable, the H&C process is not intended to eliminate all hardship, just that which is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate. The Applicants chose to remain in Canada after the RPD rejected their claims in April, 2011, to pursue other immigration avenues, so the Officer said that it could not be \"argued that the resulting hardship was not anticipated by the Act or that it was beyond their control.\"\nIII.\nIssues and Analysis\nA.\nIssues",
    "[13]\nThe following issues emerge from the parties' submissions:\n1. What is the standard of review?\n2. Did the Officer erroneously assess the best interests of the children [BIOC] ?\n3. Did the Officer erroneously assess the Applicants' establishment in Canada?\nB.\nStandard of Review",
    "[14]\nThe appropriate standard of review for an H&C decision generally is reasonableness since it involves questions of mixed fact and law: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 539 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Applicants assert, however, that correctness applies when assessing whether the Officer applied the wrong \"test\" for assessing the BIOC, and in this regard relies upon\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and upon\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 313 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In my view, such reliance is misguided since <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> have been eclipsed by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in recent years which have narrowed the types of questions of law subject to a standard of correctness: see e.g.\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 37-39 and 45-46 [\nAlberta Teachers\n]; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[15]\nFurthermore, the Federal Court of Appeal has recently confirmed that a standard of reasonableness applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation and application of section 25 of the\nAct\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 30 and 32). In this regard, Mr. Justice James Russell recently made the following observations in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (4th) 92 [\nBlas\n]: [15] Up to now, there has been a preponderance of authority from this Court holding that a standard of correctness applies to the issue of whether an officer applied the proper legal test in making an H&C decision under s. 25(1) of the Act: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Some have noted a tension between this position and the presumption of reasonableness review noted above (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )[ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], and others have concluded on that basis that a standard of reasonableness should now apply (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[16] In a pair of recent decisions dealing with s. 25 of the Act - and in particular with the proper interpretation of the recently added s. 25(1.3) - the Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that a standard of reasonableness applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation and application of s. 25 of the Act: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Justice Stratas writing for the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> observed that the Supreme Court applied a standard of reasonableness to an officer's decision under the Act in\nAgraira\n, above, and there was no basis to distinguish\nAgraira\nin the case at hand (at para 30). Thus, it is now clear that a standard of reasonableness applies to an officer's interpretation of s. 25 of the Act and the test to be applied in giving effect to it. [16]\nI am aware that whether a reasonableness standard applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation of section 25 is still open to some questions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Richard Mosley disagreed with Justice Russell's conclusion that a reasonableness standard applies to the test to be applied in making H&C decisions, and said that the correctness standard was applied to the questions of statutory interpretation in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He therefore followed previous authority and concluded \"that the standard of correctness applies to the Officer's choice of legal test\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 34).",
    "[17]\nHowever, while the Court of Appeal did apply the correctness standard in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it confined the use of this standard to situations where a question had been certified. As Justice Stratas explained at paragraph 36 of that decision:\n[P]roviding the definitive answer to a certified question on a point of statutory interpretation is the functional equivalent of engaging in correctness review. But this is merely an artefact of having a certified question put to us.\nIt is not a comment on the standard of review of Ministers' interpretations of statutory provisions generally\n. [Emphasis added]",
    "[18]\nIn my view though, it is not necessary to comment on this issue further, as the choice of standard of review will not affect the disposition of this case. As noted in\nBlas\nat paragraph 20, even the reasonableness standard is constrained since \"certain legal principles to be applied when assessing the best interests of a child directly affected by an H&C decision are firmly established by the jurisprudence, including that the threshold of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship has no application to this factor.\" Indeed, there may well be only one reasonable choice of test when an issue involves a serious question of general importance that has previously been answered by the Court of Appeal, since \"the resulting 'definitive interpretation' is meant to be binding on administrative decision-makers faced with the same issue in the future, and binding on this Court\" (\nBlas\nat paragraph 22).",
    "[19]\nWith that in mind, the Court should not interfere if the Officer's decision is intelligible, transparent, justifiable, and falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . A reviewing Court can neither reweigh the evidence that was before the Officer, nor substitute its own view of a preferable outcome:\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Furthermore, the Court does not have \"carte blanche to reformulate a tribunal's decision in a way that casts aside an unreasonable chain of analysis in favour of the court's own rationale for the result\" (\nAlberta Teachers\nat paragraph 54).\nC.\nDid the Officer erroneously assess the best interests of the children?\n(1) The Applicants' Arguments",
    "[20]\nThe Applicants argue that the Officer applied the wrong test to assess the BIOC, and they urge the Court to apply the correctness standard of review to this issue. In their view, the Officer introduced a hardship threshold into the BIOC analysis, which they argue is contrary to the guidance in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Evans JA [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Applicants further point to the formula for assessing the BIOC in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which they submit is not a rigid new test but, rather, a synthesis of the existing law.",
    "[21]\nThe Applicants say that the Court must look at the substance of the Officer's assessment and not the form of the analysis. Specifically, the Applicants argue that the Officer never identified whether it would be in the children's best interests to go to Mexico, and instead required the Applicants to show that \"the best interest of the children in this application will be negatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted.\" The Applicants say that the Officer failed to look at the stable income of the male Applicant in this case and, in view of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ever even considered the benefits that the children will receive in Canada, such as financial stability, community support, and better access to health care.\n(2) The Respondent's Arguments",
    "[22]\nThe Respondent argues that the Officer's assessment of the facts and his or her interpretation of the test with respect to the BIOC are to be reviewed on the basis of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Whatever standard is applied though, the Respondent says that the Officer did not err in assessing the BIOC.",
    "[23]\nAccording to the Respondent, it is appropriate for an officer to look at what hardship might be faced by children ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 6), so long as that officer does not require the hardship to be unusual and undeserved or disproportionate (citing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 30-31). In its view, the Officer in this case simply weighed all the factors together, and only referred to negative impacts to reject the Applicants' factual claims that removal would expose their children to crime, poverty, and discrimination. The Respondent argues that does not mean the Officer was requiring the Applicants to prove that the children would face some particular level of hardship before relief could be granted.",
    "[24]\nThe Respondent states that the evidence did not show that the children would face any dangers in Mexico based on the general country conditions. The Applicants failed to personalize these potential dangers to their children. The Respondent submits that the Officer did not need to explicitly state that it would be in the BIOC to stay in Canada, since it can be presumed that the Officer knows that the BIOC favours non-removal of the parents ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 5). To the extent that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> suggests otherwise, the Respondent emphasizes that there is no \"magic formula\" for assessing the BIOC, and argues that the framework presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> should not be followed since it contradicts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada set out what the reasonableness standard requires when an officer assesses the best interests of children:\n75 ...for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness,\nthe decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them\n. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration. However, where the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable.\n[Emphasis added]",
    "[25] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[26]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that: [24] ... an applicant is not entitled to an affirmative result on an H&C application simply because the best interests of a child favour that result. It will more often than not be in the best interests of the child to reside with his or her parents in Canada, but this is but one factor that must be weighed together with all other relevant factors. It is not for the courts to reweigh the factors considered by an H&C officer. On the other hand, an officer is required to examine the best interests of the child \"with care\" and weigh them against other factors. Mere mention that the best interests of the child has been considered will not be sufficient ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,\nsupra\n, at paragraphs 11 and 13).",
    "[27]\nWhile the Officer here acknowledged that he or she was \"required to be alert and sensitive to the interests of children ...through identification and examination of all factors related to the child's life,\" he or she was neither alert nor sensitive to\nall\nsuch factors. The Officer did not look to any scenario by which it might be in the children's best interests to stay in Canada with their parents and maintain the status quo. As Mr. Justice Donald Rennie noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 9: \"In order for an officer to be properly 'alert, alive and sensitive' to a child's best interests, the officer should have regard to the child's circumstances, from the child's perspective.\"",
    "[28]\nNot only did the Officer here not do that, but he or she also did not properly identify the BIOC and examine them \"with a great deal of attention\" or \"with care\" (\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Officer acknowledged that the documentary evidence showed that \"the high crime rates in Mexico include violence in which\nchildren are often affected\n\" (emphasis added); yet, he or she unreasonably discredits this objective evidence by stating in the very next sentence that the adult Applicants \"have not established that they or their children will be targeted or that they will experience violence should they return to Mexico\"; and adding further in the sentence after that, that the Mexican \"government is making serious efforts to protect its citizens, including children, and that laws are in place to protect children from sexual exploitation.\" In the face of this evidence, the children would face risks if removed to Mexico and the Officer needed to examine this possibility with care. The Officer here did not reasonably do that.",
    "[29]\nFurthermore, the Officer's reasons with respect to the BIOC are replete with references to whether the children would be subjected to a \"significant negative impact\" if the requested exemption was not granted, and he or she introduced a hardship threshold by requiring the Applicants to prove that \"the best interest of the children in this application will be\nnegatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted\n\" (emphasis added). The Officer's focus on negative impacts and effects clouds and confuses the assessment of the BIOC, and nowhere in the reasons is there any clear identification of what really might be in the children's\nbest\ninterests other than to remain with their parents.",
    "[30]\nAccordingly, on this basis alone, the application for judicial review should be granted.\nD.\nDid the Officer erroneously assess the Applicants' establishment in Canada?",
    "[31]\nIn view of the reasons above, I find it unnecessary to address this issue.\nE.\nCertified Question",
    "[32]\nAt the hearing of this matter, the Respondent proposed the following question of general importance to be certified:\nIn their BIOC analysis, is an officer required first to explicitly establish what is the child's best interest then establish the degree to which the child's interest are compromised by one potential factor over another in order to show that the officer has been alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the child?",
    "[33]\nThis question is in large part based on the framework for analysis of the BIOC stated by Mr. Justice James Russell in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it is stated: [63] When assessing a child's best interests an Officer must establish\nfirst\nwhat is in the child's best interest,\nsecond\nthe degree to which the child's interests are compromised by one potential decision over another, and then finally, in light of the foregoing assessment determine the weight that this factor should play in the ultimate balancing of positive and negative factors assessed in the application. [64] There is no basic needs minimum which if \"met\" satisfies the best interest test. Furthermore, there is no hardship threshold, such that if the circumstances of the child reach a certain point on that hardship scale only\nthen\nwill a child's best interests be so significantly \"negatively impacted\" as to warrant positive consideration. The question is\nnot\n: \"is the child suffering enough that his \"best interests\" are not being \"met\"? The question at the initial stage of the assessment is: \"what is in the child's best interests?\" [emphasis in original]",
    "[34]\nI agree with the Applicants that the test for certification has not been met.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal stated as follows: [9] It is trite law that to be certified, a question must (I) be dispositive of the appeal and (ii) transcend the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation, as well as contemplate issues of broad significance or general importance. As a corollary, the question must also have been raised and dealt with by the court below and it must arise from the case, not from the Judge's reasons ...",
    "[35]\nThe question proposed by the Respondent is not dispositive of the case now before the Court, since the Officer erred by not following the guidance from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[36]\nFurthermore, this Court has declined on several occasions to certify a question similar to that stated above: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nJaramillo v (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2014 FC 744 at paragraphs 76-77;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 33-35; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIV.\nConclusion",
    "[37]\nIn the result, the Applicants' application for judicial review is granted, and the matter is returned for re-determination by another immigration officer. No question of general importance is certified.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[38]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted and the matter is returned for re-determination by another immigration officer, and that no serious question of general importance is certified.\n.........................\nAbimelech Figueroa Jimenez, Miriam Rodriguez  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contexte"

Their request was refused by a senior immigration officer [Officer] and they now seek judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nAct\n, asking the Court to set aside the Officer's decision and return the matter to a different officer for re-determination.\n[2]\nThe Applicants are a married couple from Mexico and their 10-year-old son; their daughter is not party to the H&C application because she is a Canadian citizen, having been born here in 2006 after the Applicants arrived in Canada on April 19, 2005.\n[3]\nAfter the authorized period of their admission to Canada ended, the Applicants lived here without status for several years and, eventually, the female Applicant was detected by immigration officials and removal orders were issued against the family on June 23, 2009.

Some have noted a tension between this position and the presumption of reasonableness review noted above (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )[ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], and others have concluded on that basis that a standard of reasonableness should now apply (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[16] In a pair of recent decisions dealing with s. 25 of the Act - and in particular with the proper interpretation of the recently added s. 25(1.3) - the Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that a standard of reasonableness applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation and application of s. 25 of the Act: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Justice Stratas writing for the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> observed that the Supreme Court applied a standard of reasonableness to an officer's decision under the Act in\nAgraira\n, above, and there was no basis to distinguish\nAgraira\nin the case at hand (at para 30). Thus, it is now clear that a standard of reasonableness applies to an officer's interpretation of s. 25 of the Act and the test to be applied in giving effect to it.\n[16]\nI am aware that whether a reasonableness standard applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation of section 25 is still open to some questions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Richard Mosley disagreed with Justice Russell's conclusion that a reasonableness standard applies to the test to be applied in making H&C decisions, and said that the correctness standard was applied to the questions of statutory interpretation in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He therefore followed previous authority and concluded \"that the standard of correctness applies to the Officer's choice of legal test\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 34).\n[17]\nHowever, while the Court of Appeal did apply the correctness standard in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it confined the use of this standard to situations where a question had been certified. As Justice Stratas explained at paragraph 36 of that decision:\n[P]roviding the definitive answer to a certified question on a point of statutory interpretation is the functional equivalent of engaging in correctness review. But this is merely an artefact of having a certified question put to us.\nIt is not a comment on the standard of review of Ministers' interpretations of statutory provisions generally\n. [Emphasis added]\n[18]\nIn my view though, it is not necessary to comment on this issue further, as the choice of standard of review will not affect the disposition of this case. As noted in\nBlas\nat paragraph 20, even the reasonableness standard is constrained since \"certain legal principles to be applied when assessing the best interests of a child directly affected by an H&C decision are firmly established by the jurisprudence, including that the threshold of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship has no application to this factor.\" Indeed, there may well be only one reasonable choice of test when an issue involves a serious question of general importance that has previously been answered by the Court of Appeal, since \"the resulting 'definitive interpretation' is meant to be binding on administrative decision-makers faced with the same issue in the future, and binding on this Court\" (\nBlas\nat paragraph 22).\n[19]\nWith that in mind, the Court should not interfere if the Officer's decision is intelligible, transparent, justifiable, and falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . A reviewing Court can neither reweigh the evidence that was before the Officer, nor substitute its own view of a preferable outcome:\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Furthermore, the Court does not have \"carte blanche to reformulate a tribunal's decision in a way that casts aside an unreasonable chain of analysis in favour of the court's own rationale for the result\" (\nAlberta Teachers\nat paragraph 54).\nC.\nDid the Officer erroneously assess the best interests of the children?\n(1) The Applicants' Arguments\n[20]\nThe Applicants argue that the Officer applied the wrong test to assess the BIOC, and they urge the Court to apply the correctness standard of review to this issue. In their view, the Officer introduced a hardship threshold into the BIOC analysis, which they argue is contrary to the guidance in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Evans JA [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Applicants further point to the formula for assessing the BIOC in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which they submit is not a rigid new test but, rather, a synthesis of the existing law.\n[21]\nThe Applicants say that the Court must look at the substance of the Officer's assessment and not the form of the analysis. Specifically, the Applicants argue that the Officer never identified whether it would be in the children's best interests to go to Mexico, and instead required the Applicants to show that \"the best interest of the children in this application will be negatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted.\" The Applicants say that the Officer failed to look at the stable income of the male Applicant in this case and, in view of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ever even considered the benefits that the children will receive in Canada, such as financial stability, community support, and better access to health care.\n(2) The Respondent's Arguments\n[22]\nThe Respondent argues that the Officer's assessment of the facts and his or her interpretation of the test with respect to the BIOC are to be reviewed on the basis of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Whatever standard is applied though, the Respondent says that the Officer did not err in assessing the BIOC.\n[23]\nAccording to the Respondent, it is appropriate for an officer to look at what hardship might be faced by children ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 6), so long as that officer does not require the hardship to be unusual and undeserved or disproportionate (citing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 30-31). In its view, the Officer in this case simply weighed all the factors together, and only referred to negative impacts to reject the Applicants' factual claims that removal would expose their children to crime, poverty, and discrimination. The Respondent argues that does not mean the Officer was requiring the Applicants to prove that the children would face some particular level of hardship before relief could be granted.\n[24]\nThe Respondent states that the evidence did not show that the children would face any dangers in Mexico based on the general country conditions. The Applicants failed to personalize these potential dangers to their children. The Respondent submits that the Officer did not need to explicitly state that it would be in the BIOC to stay in Canada, since it can be presumed that the Officer knows that the BIOC favours non-removal of the parents ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 5). To the extent that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> suggests otherwise, the Respondent emphasizes that there is no \"magic formula\" for assessing the BIOC, and argues that the framework presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> should not be followed since it contradicts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada set out what the reasonableness standard requires when an officer assesses the best interests of children:\n75 ...for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness,\nthe decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them\n. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration. However, where the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable.\n[Emphasis added]\n[26]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that:\n[24] ... an applicant is not entitled to an affirmative result on an H&C application simply because the best interests of a child favour that result. It will more often than not be in the best interests of the child to reside with his or her parents in Canada, but this is but one factor that must be weighed together with all other relevant factors. It is not for the courts to reweigh the factors considered by an H&C officer. On the other hand, an officer is required to examine the best interests of the child \"with care\" and weigh them against other factors. Mere mention that the best interests of the child has been considered will not be sufficient ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,\nsupra\n, at paragraphs 11 and 13).\n[27]\nWhile the Officer here acknowledged that he or she was \"required to be alert and sensitive to the interests of children ...through identification and examination of all factors related to the child's life,\" he or she was neither alert nor sensitive to\nall\nsuch factors. The Officer did not look to any scenario by which it might be in the children's best interests to stay in Canada with their parents and maintain the status quo. As Mr. Justice Donald Rennie noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 9: \"In order for an officer to be properly 'alert, alive and sensitive' to a child's best interests, the officer should have regard to the child's circumstances, from the child's perspective.\"\n[28]\nNot only did the Officer here not do that, but he or she also did not properly identify the BIOC and examine them \"with a great deal of attention\" or \"with care\" (\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Officer acknowledged that the documentary evidence showed that \"the high crime rates in Mexico include violence in which\nchildren are often affected\n\" (emphasis added); yet, he or she unreasonably discredits this objective evidence by stating in the very next sentence that the adult Applicants \"have not established that they or their children will be targeted or that they will experience violence should they return to Mexico\"; and adding further in the sentence after that, that the Mexican \"government is making serious efforts to protect its citizens, including children, and that laws are in place to protect children from sexual exploitation.\" In the face of this evidence, the children would face risks if removed to Mexico and the Officer needed to examine this possibility with care. The Officer here did not reasonably do that.\n[29]\nFurthermore, the Officer's reasons with respect to the BIOC are replete with references to whether the children would be subjected to a \"significant negative impact\" if the requested exemption was not granted, and he or she introduced a hardship threshold by requiring the Applicants to prove that \"the best interest of the children in this application will be\nnegatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted\n\" (emphasis added). The Officer's focus on negative impacts and effects clouds and confuses the assessment of the BIOC, and nowhere in the reasons is there any clear identification of what really might be in the children's\nbest\ninterests other than to remain with their parents.\n[30]\nAccordingly, on this basis alone, the application for judicial review should be granted.\nD.\nDid the Officer erroneously assess the Applicants' establishment in Canada?\n[31]\nIn view of the reasons above, I find it unnecessary to address this issue.\nE.\nCertified Question\n[32]\nAt the hearing of this matter, the Respondent proposed the following question of general importance to be certified:\nIn their BIOC analysis, is an officer required first to explicitly establish what is the child's best interest then establish the degree to which the child's interest are compromised by one potential factor over another in order to show that the officer has been alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the child?\n[33]\nThis question is in large part based on the framework for analysis of the BIOC stated by Mr. Justice James Russell in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it is stated:\n[63] When assessing a child's best interests an Officer must establish\nfirst\nwhat is in the child's best interest,\nsecond\nthe degree to which the child's interests are compromised by one potential decision over another, and then finally, in light of the foregoing assessment determine the weight that this factor should play in the ultimate balancing of positive and negative factors assessed in the application.\n[64] There is no basic needs minimum which if \"met\" satisfies the best interest test. Furthermore, there is no hardship threshold, such that if the circumstances of the child reach a certain point on that hardship scale only\nthen\nwill a child's best interests be so significantly \"negatively impacted\" as to warrant positive consideration. The question is\nnot\n: \"is the child suffering enough that his \"best interests\" are not being \"met\"? The question at the initial stage of the assessment is: \"what is in the child's best interests?\" [emphasis in original]\n[34]\nI agree with the Applicants that the test for certification has not been met.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal stated as follows:\n[9] It is trite law that to be certified, a question must (I) be dispositive of the appeal and (ii) transcend the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation, as well as contemplate issues of broad significance or general importance. As a corollary, the question must also have been raised and dealt with by the court below and it must arise from the case, not from the Judge's reasons ...\n[35]\nThe question proposed by the Respondent is not dispositive of the case now before the Court, since the Officer erred by not following the guidance from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[36]\nFurthermore, this Court has declined on several occasions to certify a question similar to that stated above: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nJaramillo v (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2014 FC 744 at paragraphs 76-77;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 33-35; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIV.\nConclusion\n[37]\nIn the result, the Applicants' application for judicial review is granted, and the matter is returned for re-determination by another immigration officer. No question of general importance is certified.\nJUDGMENT\n[38]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted and the matter is returned for re-determination by another immigration officer, and that no serious question of general importance is certified.\n.........................\nAbimelech Figueroa Jimenez, Miriam Rodriguez  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contexte\n[1]\nLe juge Boswell\n[Traduction]: Les demandeurs ont présenté une demande de résidence permanente depuis le Canada et, en invoquant des considérations d'ordre humanitaire au titre du paragraphe 25(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), ont demandé à être dispensés de tout critère de la Loi auquel ils ne satisfaisaient pas. La demande a été rejetée par un agent d'immigration principal (l'agent) et les intéressés présentent maintenant une demande de contrôle judiciaire en vertu du paragraphe 72(1) de la Loi, par laquelle ils demandent à la Cour d'annuler la décision de cet agent et de renvoyer le dossier à un autre agent pour nouvelle décision.\n[2]\nLes demandeurs sont un couple marié venu du Mexique et leur fils âgé de dix ans; leur fille n'est pas partie à la demande fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire, car elle est citoyenne canadienne. Elle est en effet née au pays en 2006, soit après l'arrivée des demandeurs, le 19 avril 2005.\n[3]\nAprès que leur période de séjour autorisé au Canada eut pris fin, les demandeurs sont demeurés au pays plusieurs années et, un jour, la demanderesse a été repérée par les autorités de l'immigration et des mesures de renvoi ont été prises contre la famille le 23 juin 2009. Le jour même, les demandeurs ont présenté une demande d'asile, disant craindre d'être enlevés par des criminels s'ils retournaient au Mexique. Le 30 mars 2011, la Section de la protection des réfugiés [la SPR] a refusé de leur accorder l'asile, en concluant que les demandeurs n'étaient pas crédibles, qu'ils n'éprouvaient pas une crainte subjective de persécution et que le risque d'enlèvement était un risque généralisé. Leur demande d'examen des risques avant renvoi a également été refusée le 13 septembre 2011.\n[4]\nDans l'intervalle, les demandeurs avaient présenté une demande fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire le 22 août 2011, en alléguant que le renvoi du Canada irait à l'encontre de l'intérêt supérieur de leurs enfants et que le fait de troubler l'établissement des demandeurs et de les exposer à des conditions défavorables au Mexique leur créerait des difficultés.\nII.\nLa décision contestée\n[5]\nLe 25 avril 2013, l'agent a refusé de dispenser les demandeurs de l'application des exigences de la Loi.\n[6]\nL'agent a d'abord traité les allégations des demandeurs selon lesquelles ils subiraient des difficultés en raison des conditions défavorables au Mexique, plus particulièrement en matière de discrimination contre les femmes, de criminalité, de pauvreté et de corruption. L'agent convenait que, même s'il s'agissait là de problèmes graves au Mexique, il existait aussi des recours pour les victimes de crime. Pour ce qui est des autres conditions défavorables, il a jugé que les demandeurs n'avaient pas démontré que: [traduction]  leurs situations personnelles étaient telles que les conditions existant dans le pays en général les affecteraient directement plus que le reste de la population ou que ces conditions leur occasionneraient des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives . Comme le fardeau de la preuve reposait sur les demandeurs, l'agent a rejeté cet aspect de leurs allégations.\n[7]\nL'agent n'était pas convaincu que le degré d'établissement des demandeurs justifiait une dispense. M. Figueroa Jiménez avait dit avoir eu un emploi au Canada en tout temps, sauf quelques mois depuis son arrivée, mais l'agent a constaté que la documentation sur ses emplois commençait en 2009. Sa femme, Mme Rodriguez Jiménez, prétendait aussi avoir eu des emplois comme femme de ménage pendant deux ans, mais sans pouvoir produire de documentation à ce sujet. L'agent convenait toutefois qu'elle était engagée dans sa collectivité et que son travail de bénévole était apprécié. L'agent a aussi reconnu que les demandeurs s'étaient fait des amis au pays, mais en faisant remarquer que rien ne prouvait que la rupture de ces relations d'amitié constituerait une source de difficultés. Il a en outre relevé que, pendant leur séjour au Canada, les demandeurs [traduction]  avaient reçu un traitement équitable dans le cadre du programme pour les réfugiés, ce qui signifie qu'on est en droit de s'attendre à un certain degré d'établissement dans leur cas . Tout compte fait, l'agent n'avait pas la conviction que les demandeurs [traduction]  s'étaient intégrés à la société canadienne au point que leur départ leur causerait des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives .\n[8]\nL'agent a ensuite traité de l'allégation des demandeurs adultes selon laquelle le renvoi au Mexique nuirait à leur fils et à leur fille, respectivement âgés de huit et sept ans à l'époque. Il a fait observer que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants était un facteur important auquel il fallait accorder un poids considérable, mais qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un facteur déterminant. Les enfants réussissaient bien à l'école, mais l'agent a dit que les deux étaient encore d'un âge où leur vie tourne autour de celle des parents. De plus, rien ne démontrait qu'ils avaient noué [traduction]  des liens au Canada qui, s'ils étaient rompus, produiraient un effet défavorable marqué .\n[9]\nLes demandeurs avaient également maintenu que leurs enfants pourraient être victimes de la criminalité et de la pauvreté, et que leur fille risquerait d'être victime de discrimination du fait de son sexe. Pour ce qui est de la criminalité, l'agent a répété que le gouvernement faisait de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens. En ce qui a trait à la pauvreté et à la discrimination fondée sur le sexe, l'agent a fait remarquer que les deux demandeurs adultes avaient été instruits et qu'ils avaient occupé un emploi au Mexique avant de quitter ce pays et que Mme Rodriguez Jiménez avait fréquenté l'université pendant deux ans. Il s'attendait à ce que les enfants aient tout autant leurs chances au Mexique. L'agent a mentionné ceci: [traduction]  Je remarque que les enfants peuvent jouir de meilleures perspectives économiques et sociales au Canada, mais la preuve dont je dispose n'appuie pas le fait qu'ils seraient privés de services d'éducation et de santé ou qu'ils seraient la cible d'agression, de traite de personnes ou d'enlèvement au Mexique. \n[10]\nL'agent a ensuite dit qu'il faudrait probablement un certain temps aux enfants pour s'adapter à la vie au Mexique en précisant qu'il était [traduction]  raisonnable de penser qu'ils avaient été exposés à la langue et à la culture du Mexique par leurs parents . Les amis qu'ils s'étaient faits au Canada pourraient leur manquer, mais ils seraient encore avec leurs principaux aidants naturels et pourraient bénéficier de l'appui de leur famille étendue en sol mexicain. L'agent a conclu que les demandeurs [traduction]  n'avaient pas établi, au moyen de la preuve documentaire objective, que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants visés par la présente demande serait compromis au point de justifier l'octroi d'une dispense .\n[11]\nL'agent a aussi conclu que les demandeurs étaient en mesure de s'établir à nouveau au Mexique. Non seulement leurs compétences et expériences professionnelles étaient raisonnablement transférables, mais ils bénéficiaient aussi de membres de leur famille au Mexique, qui pourraient vraisemblablement leur apporter un soutien affectif.\n[12]\nL'agent a donc rejeté la demande en disant que, si le désir des demandeurs de demeurer au Canada pouvait se comprendre, le processus de demande fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire n'était pas là pour écarter toutes les difficultés, mais seulement les difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives. Les demandeurs ont choisi de rester au Canada après que la Section de la protection des réfugiés eut rejeté leurs demandes d'asile en avril 2011, en vue de poursuivre d'autres recours en matière d'immigration. L'agent a dit qu'on ne pourrait alors [traduction]  faire valoir que les difficultés en cause n'étaient pas prévues par la Loi, ni qu'elles étaient indépendantes de la volonté des demandeurs .\nIII.\nLes questions en litige et analyse\nA.\nLes questions\n[13]\nLes questions suivantes se dégagent des observations des parties:\n1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle?\n2. L'agent a-t-il apprécié de manière erronée l'intérêt supérieur des enfants?\n3. L'agent a-t-il apprécié de manière erronée l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada?\nB.\nLa norme de contrôle\n[14]\nLa norme de contrôle applicable à une décision quant à une demande fondée sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire est généralement celle de la raisonnabilité, puisque ce sont des questions mixtes de fait et de droit qui se posent; voir par exemple les arrêts\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 18, et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  DLR (4 th) 539 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], aux paragraphes 30, 32 et 37. Les demandeurs affirment cependant que c'est la norme de la décision correcte qui s'applique quand il s'agit de juger si l'agent a appliqué le bon  critère  pour apprécier l'intérêt supérieur des enfants. Ils s'appuient à cet égard sur les décisions\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (4th) 313 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 26. À mon avis, les demandeurs se trompent en se fondant sur ces décisions, puisqu'elles ont été éclipsées par des arrêts de Cour suprême du Canada au cours des dernières années, arrêts qui ont rétréci la gamme des questions de droit assujetties à la norme de la décision correcte; voir à cet égard les arrêts\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [\nAlberta Teachers\n], aux paragraphes 37-39 et 45-46, et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 25-26 et 31-33.\n[15]\nQui plus est, la Cour d'appel fédérale a récemment confirmé l'applicabilité de la norme de la raisonnabilité au contrôle de l'interprétation et de l'application par l'agent de l'article 25 de la Loi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 30 et 32). Sur ce plan, monsieur le juge James Russell a récemment fait observer ce qui suit dans l'affaire\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (4th) 92 [\nBlas\n]:\n[15] Jusqu'à maintenant, la jurisprudence dominante de la Cour enseigne que la norme de contrôle applicable à la question de savoir si l'agent a appliqué le bon critère juridique en rendant une décision relative à une demande CH aux termes du paragraphe 25(1) de la Loi est celle de la décision correcte: voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Certains ont relevé une contradiction entre cette position et la présomption d'assujettissement à la norme de la décision raisonnable mentionnée ci-dessus (voir la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]), et d'autres ont conclu sur ce fondement que la norme de la décision raisonnable devrait dorénavant s'appliquer (voir la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[16] Dans deux arrêts récents traitant de l'article 25 de la Loi - et plus particulièrement de la bonne interprétation à donner au paragraphe 25(1.3) récemment ajouté -, la Cour d'appel fédérale a confirmé que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique au contrôle de l'interprétation et de l'application par l'agent de l'article 25 de la Loi: voir les arrêts\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Le juge Stratas, s'exprimant au nom de la Cour d'appel dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , a fait observer que la Cour suprême avait appliqué la norme de la décision raisonnable pour contrôler la décision rendue par l'agent en vertu de la Loi dans l'arrêt\nAgraira\n, précité, et que rien ne permettait d'établir une distinction entre l'arrêt\nAgraira\net l'affaire dont la Cour d'appel était saisie (au paragraphe 30). Ainsi, il est désormais clair que la norme de la décision raisonnable s'applique à l'interprétation de l'article 25 de la Loi faite par l'agent et à la détermination du critère à appliquer pour lui donner effet.\n[16]\nJe sais que l'applicabilité de la norme de la raisonnabilité au contrôle de l'interprétation par un agent de l'article 25 demeure sujette à discussion quant à certains points.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> monsieur le juge Richard Mosley s'est inscrit en faux à l'égard de la conclusion du juge Russell quant à l'application de la norme de la raisonnabilité au critère à employer dans les décisions relatives à des demandes fondées sur des considérations d'ordre humanitaire, en disant que la norme de la décision correcte avait été appliquée aux questions d'interprétation législative dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il s'en est tenu à ce qui faisait autorité antérieurement pour conclure  que le choix par [l'agent] du critère juridique commande la norme de la décision correcte  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 34).\n[17]\nToutefois, bien que la Cour d'appel ait bel et bien appliqué cette norme dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , elle en a limité l'application aux situations où une question avait été certifiée. Comme l'a expliqué le juge Stratas au paragraphe 36 de cette décision:\nLorsque la Cour répond de manière définitive à une question certifiée sur un point d'interprétation législative, cela équivaut pour elle à procéder, sur le plan fonctionnel, à un contrôle selon la norme de la décision correcte. Cela traduit toutefois simplement le fait qu'une question certifiée nous a été soumise.\nCela ne se veut pas un commentaire d'ordre général sur la norme de contrôle applicable aux interprétations de dispositions législatives faites par les ministres\n.\n[Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[18]\nÀ mon avis cependant, il serait inutile de commenter davantage quant à cette question, puisque le choix d'une norme de contrôle n'aura aucune influence sur l'issue de l'affaire. Comme il a été mentionné dans la décision\nBlas\nau paragraphe 20, même la norme de la raisonnabilité est restreinte dans son application, puisque  la jurisprudence établit fermement certains principes juridiques devant être appliqués au moment d'évaluer l'intérêt supérieur d'un enfant directement touché par une décision relative à une demande CH, y compris le principe selon lequel le critère des difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives n'est pas approprié dans l'évaluation de ce facteur . En fait, il se pourrait bien qu'il n'y ait qu'un choix raisonnable de critère lorsqu'une question en litige traite d'une question grave de portée générale ayant déjà été tranchée par la Cour d'appel fédérale, puisque  \"l'interprétation définitive\" ainsi donnée se veut contraignante pour les décideurs administratifs devant trancher la même question par la suite, et qu'elle lie la Cour  (\nBlas\n, au paragraphe 22).\n[19]\nPar conséquent, la Cour ne devrait pas intervenir à l'égard d'une décision qui est intelligible, transparente et justifiable, et qui appartient aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit. Voir à cet égard l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47. Une cour de révision ne peut soupeser à nouveau les éléments de preuve ni substituer la solution qu'elle juge appropriée à celle qui a été retenue. Voir à cet égard l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 59 et 61. Ajoutons que la justice n'a pas le  pouvoir absolu de reformuler la décision en substituant à l'analyse qu'elle juge déraisonnable sa propre justification du résultat  (\nAlberta Teachers\n, au paragraphe 54).\nC.\nL'agent a-t-il apprécié de manière erronée l'intérêt supérieur des enfants [ISE] ?\n(1) Les arguments des demandeurs\n[20]\nLes demandeurs font valoir que l'agent a appliqué le mauvais critère pour évaluer l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et prient instamment la Cour d'appliquer la norme de la décision correcte dans son examen de cette question en litige. À leur avis, l'agent a introduit un seuil de difficultés dans son analyse relative à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants, ce qui, selon eux, contrevient aux directives formulées dans l'arrêt\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , juge Evans [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], et dans les décisions\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 7, et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Les demandeurs invoquent en outre la formule d'appréciation de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants énoncée dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], formule qui, selon eux, n'est pas un nouveau critère rigide, mais plutôt une synthèse du droit applicable.\n[21]\nLes demandeurs disent que la Cour doit s'attarder au fond de l'appréciation de l'agent et non à la forme de l'analyse. Plus précisément, ils soutiennent que l'agent n'a jamais indiqué s'il était dans l'intérêt supérieur des enfants d'aller au Mexique, et qu'il a plutôt exigé des demandeurs qu'ils prouvent que [traduction]  que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants visés par la présente demande serait compromis au point de justifier l'octroi d'une dispense.  Ils allèguent que l'agent a négligé de tenir compte du revenu stable du demandeur masculin adulte en l'espèce et, eu égard à la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 14, n'a même jamais pris en considération les avantages dont jouiront les enfants au Canada, qu'il s'agisse de stabilité financière, de soutien de la collectivité ou d'un meilleur accès aux services de santé.\n(2) Les arguments du défendeur\n[22]\nLe défendeur fait valoir que l'appréciation des faits de l'agent et son interprétation du critère devant être appliqué en ce qui concerne l'intérêt supérieur des enfants doivent être contrôlés selon la norme de la raisonnabilité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Quelle qu'ait été la norme appliquée, l'agent ne s'est pas trompé, de l'avis du défendeur, dans son appréciation de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant.\n[23]\nAux yeux du défendeur, il convient qu'un agent regarde les difficultés auxquelles les enfants pourraient être exposées ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 6), dans la mesure où il n'insiste pas sur l'existence de difficultés inhabituelles et injustifiées ou excessives (renvoyant à l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> aux paragraphes 30 et 31). Selon lui, l'agent a simplement soupesé tous les facteurs ensemble en l'espèce et il a uniquement renvoyé aux facteurs défavorables pour rejeter les allégations de fait des demandeurs selon lesquelles le renvoi au Mexique exposerait les enfants à la criminalité, à la pauvreté et à la discrimination. Il maintient que cela ne signifie pas que l'agent exigeait des demandeurs qu'ils prouvent que les enfants seraient exposés à un degré particulier de difficultés avant que la dispense ne puisse leur être accordée.\n[24]\nLe défendeur affirme que la preuve ne démontrait pas que les enfants seraient exposés à quelque danger que ce soit au Mexique, à en juger par les conditions générales dans ce pays. Les demandeurs n'ont pas expliqué en quoi ces possibles dangers exposaient leurs enfants à un risque personnalisé. De l'avis du défendeur, l'agent n'avait pas à dire en toutes lettres qu'il était dans l'intérêt supérieur des enfants de demeurer au Canada, puisqu'on peut présumer qu'il savait que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants militait en faveur du non-renvoi des parents au Mexique ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 5). Dans la mesure où <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> dit autre chose, le défendeur souligne qu'il n'y a pas de  formule magique  pour apprécier l'intérêt supérieur des enfants et il prétend que la Cour ne devrait pas suivre le cadre employé dans la décision\nWilliams,\npuisque celui-ci contredit les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (renvoyant à la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour suprême du Canada énonce ce qu'exige la norme de la raisonnabilité dans un cas où un agent examine l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant:\n75 [...] pour que l'exercice du pouvoir discrétionnaire respecte la norme du caractère raisonnable,\nle décideur devrait considérer l'intérêt supérieur des enfants comme un facteur important, lui accorder un poids considérable, et être réceptif, attentif et sensible à cet intérêt\n. Cela ne veut pas dire que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants l'emportera toujours sur d'autres considérations, ni qu'il y aura d'autres raisons de rejeter une demande d'ordre humanitaire même en tenant compte de l'intérêt des enfants. Toutefois, quand l'intérêt des enfants est minimisé, d'une manière incompatible avec la tradition humanitaire du Canada et les directives du ministre, la décision est déraisonnable.\n[Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[26] <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Kisana\n, la Cour d'appel fédérale a donné l'éclaircissement suivant:\n[24] [...] un demandeur ne peut s'attendre à une réponse favorable à sa demande fondée sur des motifs d'ordre humanitaire simplement parce que l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant milite en faveur de ce résultat. La plupart du temps, il est dans l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant de résider avec ses parents au Canada, mais ce facteur n'est qu'un de ceux dont il y a lieu de tenir compte. Il n'appartient pas aux tribunaux de procéder à un nouvel examen du poids accordé aux différents facteurs par l'agent chargé de se prononcer sur les raisons d'ordre humanitaire. En revanche, l'intérêt supérieur des enfants est un facteur que l'agent doit examiner  avec beaucoup d'attention  et qu'il doit soupeser avec les autres facteurs applicables. Le simple fait de dire qu'on a tenu compte de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant n'est pas suffisant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,\nprécité\n, aux paragraphes 11 et 13).\n[27]\nBien que l'agent ait reconnu être [traduction]  tenu d'être réceptif et sensible aux intérêts des enfants [...] en relevant et en examinant la totalité des facteurs liés à la vie des enfants , il n'a été ni réceptif ni sensible à\ntout\nce qui ressemblait à de tels facteurs. Il n'a envisagé aucun scénario selon lequel il serait dans l'intérêt supérieur des enfants de demeurer au Canada avec leurs parents et où il y aurait donc lieu d'opter pour le statu quo. Comme M. le juge Donald Rennie l'a fait observer dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> au paragraphe 9:  Pour qu'on puisse conclure qu'il a été adéquatement \"réceptif, attentif et sensible\" à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, il faut que l'agent ait tenu compte de la situation de l'enfant en se plaçant du point de vue de l'enfant .\n[28]\nNon seulement l'agent ne l'a pas fait en l'espèce, mais il n'a pas non plus dûment établi l'intérêt supérieur des enfants pour l'examiner  avec beaucoup d'attention  ou  avec soin  (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. Il a reconnu que la preuve documentaire indiquait que [traduction]  les hauts taux de criminalité au Mexique comprennent notamment les actes de violence, dans lesquels\nles enfants sont souvent victimes\n [non souligné dans l'original]; toutefois; il se trouve lui-même à discréditer hors de toute raison cette preuve objective en affirmant, tout juste après la phrase citée ci-dessus, que les demandeurs adultes [traduction]  n'ont pas établi que leurs enfants seraient ciblés ou qu'ils subiraient de la violence s'ils devaient revenir au Mexique . Il a ajouté dans la même phrase que le [traduction]  gouvernement [mexicain] fait de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens, dont les enfants, et que des lois sont en place pour préserver les enfants de l'exploitation sexuelle . Au regard de cet élément de preuve, les enfants seraient exposés à des risques s'ils étaient renvoyés au Mexique et l'agent se devait d'examiner cette possibilité avec soin. On peut raisonnablement penser ici qu'il ne l'a pas fait.\n[29]\nDe plus, les motifs de l'agent concernant l'intérêt supérieur des enfants abondent en mentions quant à la question de savoir si les enfants seraient ou non exposés à un [traduction]  effet défavorable marqué  dans l'éventualité où la dispense demandée n'était pas accordée. Il a lui-même introduit un seuil de difficultés en exigeant des demandeurs qu'ils prouvent que [traduction]  que l'intérêt supérieur des enfants visés par la présente demande\nserait compromis au point de justifier l'octroi d'une dispense\n [non souligné dans l'original]. Que l'agent insiste sur les effets négatifs défavorables jette une ombre et crée de la confusion dans son appréciation de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants. Les motifs ne contiennent aucune indication claire de ce que pourrait réellement être l'intérêt\nsupérieur\ndes enfants, en dehors du fait de demeurer avec leurs parents.\n[30]\nPour cette seule considération, la demande de contrôle judiciaire devrait donc être accueillie.\nD.\nL'agent a-t-il apprécié de manière erronée l'établissement des demandeurs au Canada?\n[31]\nCompte tenu des motifs exposés ci-dessus, je juge inutile de traiter de cette question.\nE.\nLa question à des fins de certification\n[32]\nLors de l'audience relative à la présente affaire, le défendeur a proposé la certification de la question de portée générale suivante:\n[traduction]\nDans son analyse de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, un agent est-il tenu d'établir expressément ce qu'est l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, puis de juger dans quelle mesure cet intérêt se trouve compromis par un facteur plus qu'un autre, pour démontrer qu'il a été réceptif, attentif et sensible à l'intérêt supérieur des enfants?\n[33]\nLa question est fondée en grande partie sur le cadre d'analyse de l'intérêt supérieur des enfants présenté par monsieur le juge James Russell dans l'affaire <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[63] Lorsqu'il analyse l'intérêt supérieur d'un enfant, l'agent doit d'\nabord\ndéterminer en quoi consiste l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, en\ndeuxième\nlieu, jusqu'à quel point l'intérêt de l'enfant est compromis par une décision éventuelle par rapport à une autre et,\nenfin\n, à la lumière de l'analyse susmentionnée, le poids que ce facteur joue lorsqu'il s'agit de trouver un équilibre entre les facteurs positifs et les facteurs négatifs dont il a été tenu compte lors de l'examen de la demande fondée sur des raisons d'ordre humanitaire.\n[64] Il n'existe pas de norme minimale en matière de besoins fondamentaux qui satisferait au critère de l'intérêt supérieur. De plus, il n'existe pas de critère minimal en matière de difficultés suivant lequel à un certain point dans l'échelle des difficultés et\nseulement à ce point\npourrait-on considérer que l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant est  compromis  au point de justifier une décision favorable. La question\nn'est pas\nde savoir si l'enfant  souffre assez  pour que l'on considère que son  intérêt supérieur  ne sera pas  respecté . À cette étape initiale de l'analyse, la question à laquelle il faut répondre est la suivante:  en quoi consiste l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant?  [Passages soulignés et en italiques dans l'original.]\n[34]\nJe conviens avec les demandeurs que le critère de certification n'a pas été respecté. Dans l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la Cour d'appel fédérale s'est ainsi exprimée:\n[9] Il est de droit constant que, pour être certifiée, une question doit i) être déterminante quant à l'issue de l'appel, ii) transcender les intérêts des parties au litige et porter sur des questions ayant des conséquences importantes ou qui sont de portée générale. En corollaire, la question doit avoir été soulevée et examinée dans la décision de la cour d'instance inférieure, et elle doit découler de l'affaire, et non des motifs du juge [...]\n[35]\nLa question proposée par le défendeur n'est pas déterminante quant à l'issue de l'affaire dont est saisie la Cour, car l'agent a commis une erreur en ne suivant pas les directives contenues dans les arrêts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[36]\nQui plus est, la Cour a refusé à plusieurs occasions de certifier une question similaire à celle qui précède.

Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI.\nNature of the Matter and Background\n\n[1]\nBoswell, J.\n: The Applicants applied for permanent residence from within Canada and, claiming humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds under subsection 25(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [\nAct\n], asked for exemptions from any criteria of the\nAct\nwhich they did not satisfy. Their request was refused by a senior immigration officer [Officer] and they now seek judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nAct\n, asking the Court to set aside the Officer's decision and return the matter to a different officer for re-determination.\n\n[2]\nThe Applicants are a married couple from Mexico and their 10-year-old son; their daughter is not party to the H&C application because she is a Canadian citizen, having been born here in 2006 after the Applicants arrived in Canada on April 19, 2005.\n\n[3]\nAfter the authorized period of their admission to Canada ended, the Applicants lived here without status for several years and, eventually, the female Applicant was detected by immigration officials and removal orders were issued against the family on June 23, 2009. On the same day, the Applicants applied for refugee protection, claiming that they feared they would be abducted by criminals if they returned to Mexico. On March 30, 2011, the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] dismissed the Applicants' claims because it found they were not credible and did not subjectively fear persecution, and that the risk of abduction was generalized. A pre-removal risk assessment was also refused on September 13, 2011.\n\n[4]\nIn the meantime, the Applicants had applied for H&C consideration on August 22, 2011, saying that it would not be in the best interests of their children to remove them from Canada and that it would cause the Applicants hardship to disturb their establishment and expose them to the adverse country conditions in Mexico.\nII.\nDecision under Review\n\n[5]\nOn April 25, 2013, the Officer refused to grant the Applicants any exemptions from the requirements of the\nAct\n.\n\n[6]\nThe Officer dealt first with the Applicants' claims that they would suffer hardship because of adverse country conditions, particularly with regard to discrimination against women, crime, poverty, and corruption. The Officer accepted that, while all were serious problems in Mexico, there were mechanisms for victims of crime to obtain redress. As for the other adverse country conditions, the Officer determined that the Applicants had not proven that \"their personal circumstances are such that the general country conditions will directly affect them to a greater extent than the general population or that the general country conditions will cause a hardship for the applicants that is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.\" As the onus was on the Applicants, the Officer rejected this aspect of their claims.\n\n[7]\nThe Officer was not convinced that the Applicants' degree of establishment warranted relief. Although Mr. Figueroa Jiménez had said that he was employed in Canada for all but a few months since his arrival here, the Officer noted that there was only documentation to support employment since 2009. His wife, Mrs. Rodriguez Jiménez, had also claimed to have been employed as a cleaner for two years, but there was no documentation that that was the case. The Officer did accept, however, that she was involved in the community and that her volunteer work was appreciated. The Officer also accepted that the Applicants had made friends here, but noted that there was no proof that severing those relationships would cause any hardship. Furthermore, the Officer noted that during their time in Canada the Applicants \"have received due process in the refugee protection system and therefore a measure of establishment is expected to have occurred.\" Ultimately, the Officer was not satisfied that the Applicants \"have integrated into Canadian society to the extent that their departure would cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.\"\n\n[8]\nThe Officer then addressed the adult Applicants' claim that removal to Mexico would negatively affect their son, who was 8 years old at the time, and their daughter, who was then 7. The Officer observed that the best interests of these children was a significant factor which should be given substantial weight, but it was not determinative. Here, the children were doing well in school, but the Officer said that both children were still of an age where their lives revolved around their parents. There was also no evidence that they had developed \"relationships in Canada that if severed, would have a significant negative impact.\"\n\n[9]\nThe Applicants had also claimed that their children could be affected by crime and poverty and that their daughter could suffer from gender discrimination. With respect to crime, the Officer again said that the government was making serious efforts to protect its citizens. As for poverty and gender discrimination, the Officer noted that both of the adult Applicants were educated and employed in Mexico prior to their departure, and that Mrs. Rodriguez Jiménez had gone to university for two years. The Officer expected the children to have similar opportunities in Mexico, and said that: \"[w]hile I note that children may enjoy better economic and social opportunities in Canada, the evidence before me does not support that they will be denied education, health care or would be targeted for abuse, trafficking or kidnapping in Mexico.\"\n\n[10]\nThe Officer then noted that the children would probably need some time to adjust to life in Mexico, but said that it is \"reasonable that they have been exposed to the language and culture of Mexico through their parents.\" While they might miss the friends they have made in Canada, they will still be with their primary caregivers and may benefit from the support of their extended family in Mexico. The Officer therefore concluded that the Applicants \"have not established with objective documentary evidence that the best interest of the children in this application will be negatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted.\"\n\n[11]\nThe Officer further found that the Applicants could re-establish themselves in Mexico. Not only did they have reasonably transferable skills and employment experiences, but they also have family in Mexico who could likely support them emotionally.\n\n[12]\nThe Officer thus refused the application, noting that while the Applicants' desire to remain in Canada was understandable, the H&C process is not intended to eliminate all hardship, just that which is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate. The Applicants chose to remain in Canada after the RPD rejected their claims in April, 2011, to pursue other immigration avenues, so the Officer said that it could not be \"argued that the resulting hardship was not anticipated by the Act or that it was beyond their control.\"\nIII.\nIssues and Analysis\nA.\nIssues\n\n[13]\nThe following issues emerge from the parties' submissions:\n1. What is the standard of review?\n2. Did the Officer erroneously assess the best interests of the children [BIOC] ?\n3. Did the Officer erroneously assess the Applicants' establishment in Canada?\nB.\nStandard of Review\n\n[14]\nThe appropriate standard of review for an H&C decision generally is reasonableness since it involves questions of mixed fact and law: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> DLR (4th) 539 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Applicants assert, however, that correctness applies when assessing whether the Officer applied the wrong \"test\" for assessing the BIOC, and in this regard relies upon\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and upon\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Imm LR (4th) 313 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In my view, such reliance is misguided since <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> have been eclipsed by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in recent years which have narrowed the types of questions of law subject to a standard of correctness: see e.g.\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paragraphs 37-39 and 45-46 [\nAlberta Teachers\n]; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[15]\nFurthermore, the Federal Court of Appeal has recently confirmed that a standard of reasonableness applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation and application of section 25 of the\nAct\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 30 and 32). In this regard, Mr. Justice James Russell recently made the following observations in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (4th) 92 [\nBlas\n]: [15] Up to now, there has been a preponderance of authority from this Court holding that a standard of correctness applies to the issue of whether an officer applied the proper legal test in making an H&C decision under s. 25(1) of the Act: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Some have noted a tension between this position and the presumption of reasonableness review noted above (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )[ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], and others have concluded on that basis that a standard of reasonableness should now apply (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[16] In a pair of recent decisions dealing with s. 25 of the Act - and in particular with the proper interpretation of the recently added s. 25(1.3) - the Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that a standard of reasonableness applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation and application of s. 25 of the Act: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Justice Stratas writing for the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> observed that the Supreme Court applied a standard of reasonableness to an officer's decision under the Act in\nAgraira\n, above, and there was no basis to distinguish\nAgraira\nin the case at hand (at para 30). Thus, it is now clear that a standard of reasonableness applies to an officer's interpretation of s. 25 of the Act and the test to be applied in giving effect to it. [16]\nI am aware that whether a reasonableness standard applies when reviewing an officer's interpretation of section 25 is still open to some questions.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Mr. Justice Richard Mosley disagreed with Justice Russell's conclusion that a reasonableness standard applies to the test to be applied in making H&C decisions, and said that the correctness standard was applied to the questions of statutory interpretation in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . He therefore followed previous authority and concluded \"that the standard of correctness applies to the Officer's choice of legal test\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 34).\n\n[17]\nHowever, while the Court of Appeal did apply the correctness standard in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , it confined the use of this standard to situations where a question had been certified. As Justice Stratas explained at paragraph 36 of that decision:\n[P]roviding the definitive answer to a certified question on a point of statutory interpretation is the functional equivalent of engaging in correctness review. But this is merely an artefact of having a certified question put to us.\nIt is not a comment on the standard of review of Ministers' interpretations of statutory provisions generally\n. [Emphasis added]\n\n[18]\nIn my view though, it is not necessary to comment on this issue further, as the choice of standard of review will not affect the disposition of this case. As noted in\nBlas\nat paragraph 20, even the reasonableness standard is constrained since \"certain legal principles to be applied when assessing the best interests of a child directly affected by an H&C decision are firmly established by the jurisprudence, including that the threshold of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship has no application to this factor.\" Indeed, there may well be only one reasonable choice of test when an issue involves a serious question of general importance that has previously been answered by the Court of Appeal, since \"the resulting 'definitive interpretation' is meant to be binding on administrative decision-makers faced with the same issue in the future, and binding on this Court\" (\nBlas\nat paragraph 22).\n\n[19]\nWith that in mind, the Court should not interfere if the Officer's decision is intelligible, transparent, justifiable, and falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . A reviewing Court can neither reweigh the evidence that was before the Officer, nor substitute its own view of a preferable outcome:\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Furthermore, the Court does not have \"carte blanche to reformulate a tribunal's decision in a way that casts aside an unreasonable chain of analysis in favour of the court's own rationale for the result\" (\nAlberta Teachers\nat paragraph 54).\nC.\nDid the Officer erroneously assess the best interests of the children?\n(1) The Applicants' Arguments\n\n[20]\nThe Applicants argue that the Officer applied the wrong test to assess the BIOC, and they urge the Court to apply the correctness standard of review to this issue. In their view, the Officer introduced a hardship threshold into the BIOC analysis, which they argue is contrary to the guidance in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Evans JA [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Applicants further point to the formula for assessing the BIOC in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], which they submit is not a rigid new test but, rather, a synthesis of the existing law.\n\n[21]\nThe Applicants say that the Court must look at the substance of the Officer's assessment and not the form of the analysis. Specifically, the Applicants argue that the Officer never identified whether it would be in the children's best interests to go to Mexico, and instead required the Applicants to show that \"the best interest of the children in this application will be negatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted.\" The Applicants say that the Officer failed to look at the stable income of the male Applicant in this case and, in view of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ever even considered the benefits that the children will receive in Canada, such as financial stability, community support, and better access to health care.\n(2) The Respondent's Arguments\n\n[22]\nThe Respondent argues that the Officer's assessment of the facts and his or her interpretation of the test with respect to the BIOC are to be reviewed on the basis of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Whatever standard is applied though, the Respondent says that the Officer did not err in assessing the BIOC.\n\n[23]\nAccording to the Respondent, it is appropriate for an officer to look at what hardship might be faced by children ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 6), so long as that officer does not require the hardship to be unusual and undeserved or disproportionate (citing <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 30-31). In its view, the Officer in this case simply weighed all the factors together, and only referred to negative impacts to reject the Applicants' factual claims that removal would expose their children to crime, poverty, and discrimination. The Respondent argues that does not mean the Officer was requiring the Applicants to prove that the children would face some particular level of hardship before relief could be granted.\n\n[24]\nThe Respondent states that the evidence did not show that the children would face any dangers in Mexico based on the general country conditions. The Applicants failed to personalize these potential dangers to their children. The Respondent submits that the Officer did not need to explicitly state that it would be in the BIOC to stay in Canada, since it can be presumed that the Officer knows that the BIOC favours non-removal of the parents ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 5). To the extent that <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> suggests otherwise, the Respondent emphasizes that there is no \"magic formula\" for assessing the BIOC, and argues that the framework presented in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> should not be followed since it contradicts <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Supreme Court of Canada set out what the reasonableness standard requires when an officer assesses the best interests of children:\n75 ...for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness,\nthe decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them\n. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration. However, where the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable.\n[Emphasis added]\n\n[25] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[26]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that: [24] ... an applicant is not entitled to an affirmative result on an H&C application simply because the best interests of a child favour that result. It will more often than not be in the best interests of the child to reside with his or her parents in Canada, but this is but one factor that must be weighed together with all other relevant factors. It is not for the courts to reweigh the factors considered by an H&C officer. On the other hand, an officer is required to examine the best interests of the child \"with care\" and weigh them against other factors. Mere mention that the best interests of the child has been considered will not be sufficient ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ,\nsupra\n, at paragraphs 11 and 13).\n\n[27]\nWhile the Officer here acknowledged that he or she was \"required to be alert and sensitive to the interests of children ...through identification and examination of all factors related to the child's life,\" he or she was neither alert nor sensitive to\nall\nsuch factors. The Officer did not look to any scenario by which it might be in the children's best interests to stay in Canada with their parents and maintain the status quo. As Mr. Justice Donald Rennie noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraph 9: \"In order for an officer to be properly 'alert, alive and sensitive' to a child's best interests, the officer should have regard to the child's circumstances, from the child's perspective.\"\n\n[28]\nNot only did the Officer here not do that, but he or she also did not properly identify the BIOC and examine them \"with a great deal of attention\" or \"with care\" (\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. The Officer acknowledged that the documentary evidence showed that \"the high crime rates in Mexico include violence in which\nchildren are often affected\n\" (emphasis added); yet, he or she unreasonably discredits this objective evidence by stating in the very next sentence that the adult Applicants \"have not established that they or their children will be targeted or that they will experience violence should they return to Mexico\"; and adding further in the sentence after that, that the Mexican \"government is making serious efforts to protect its citizens, including children, and that laws are in place to protect children from sexual exploitation.\" In the face of this evidence, the children would face risks if removed to Mexico and the Officer needed to examine this possibility with care. The Officer here did not reasonably do that.\n\n[29]\nFurthermore, the Officer's reasons with respect to the BIOC are replete with references to whether the children would be subjected to a \"significant negative impact\" if the requested exemption was not granted, and he or she introduced a hardship threshold by requiring the Applicants to prove that \"the best interest of the children in this application will be\nnegatively affected to the extent that an exemption is warranted\n\" (emphasis added). The Officer's focus on negative impacts and effects clouds and confuses the assessment of the BIOC, and nowhere in the reasons is there any clear identification of what really might be in the children's\nbest\ninterests other than to remain with their parents.\n\n[30]\nAccordingly, on this basis alone, the application for judicial review should be granted.\nD.\nDid the Officer erroneously assess the Applicants' establishment in Canada?\n\n[31]\nIn view of the reasons above, I find it unnecessary to address this issue.\nE.\nCertified Question\n\n[32]\nAt the hearing of this matter, the Respondent proposed the following question of general importance to be certified:\nIn their BIOC analysis, is an officer required first to explicitly establish what is the child's best interest then establish the degree to which the child's interest are compromised by one potential factor over another in order to show that the officer has been alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the child?\n\n[33]\nThis question is in large part based on the framework for analysis of the BIOC stated by Mr. Justice James Russell in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , where it is stated: [63] When assessing a child's best interests an Officer must establish\nfirst\nwhat is in the child's best interest,\nsecond\nthe degree to which the child's interests are compromised by one potential decision over another, and then finally, in light of the foregoing assessment determine the weight that this factor should play in the ultimate balancing of positive and negative factors assessed in the application. [64] There is no basic needs minimum which if \"met\" satisfies the best interest test. Furthermore, there is no hardship threshold, such that if the circumstances of the child reach a certain point on that hardship scale only\nthen\nwill a child's best interests be so significantly \"negatively impacted\" as to warrant positive consideration. The question is\nnot\n: \"is the child suffering enough that his \"best interests\" are not being \"met\"? The question at the initial stage of the assessment is: \"what is in the child's best interests?\" [emphasis in original]\n\n[34]\nI agree with the Applicants that the test for certification has not been met.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal stated as follows: [9] It is trite law that to be certified, a question must (I) be dispositive of the appeal and (ii) transcend the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation, as well as contemplate issues of broad significance or general importance. As a corollary, the question must also have been raised and dealt with by the court below and it must arise from the case, not from the Judge's reasons ...\n\n[35]\nThe question proposed by the Respondent is not dispositive of the case now before the Court, since the Officer erred by not following the guidance from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[36]\nFurthermore, this Court has declined on several occasions to certify a question similar to that stated above: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nJaramillo v (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n, 2014 FC 744 at paragraphs 76-77;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at paragraphs 33-35; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\nIV.\nConclusion\n\n[37]\nIn the result, the Applicants' application for judicial review is granted, and the matter is returned for re-determination by another immigration officer. No question of general importance is certified.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[38]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted and the matter is returned for re-determination by another immigration officer, and that no serious question of general importance is certified.\n.........................\nAbimelech Figueroa Jimenez, Miriam Rodriguez  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  contexte",

      "On the same day as the removal orders, the family applied for refugee protection, claiming fear of abduction in Mexico.",
      "The refugee protection claim was dismissed in March 2011 due to credibility concerns and a finding of no subjective fear of persecution.",
      "A pre-removal risk assessment was also denied in September 2011.",
      "The family submitted a humanitarian and compassionate application in August 2011, citing the best interests of their children and hardship related to potential removal to Mexico.",
      "The application for exemptions from immigration requirements was refused by an immigration officer in April 2013.",

        "The Officer did not err in assessing the BIOC.",
        "It is appropriate for an officer to consider potential hardships faced by children, as long as a hardship threshold is not required.",
        "The Officer weighed all factors together and rejected the Applicants’ claims based on factual findings.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court applied a standard of reasonableness to review the immigration officer’s decision, rejecting the applicants’ argument for a correctness standard, citing recent Supreme Court of Canada and Federal Court of Appeal decisions narrowing the scope of correctness review and specifically affirming reasonableness for section 25 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.",
      "The court found the officer erred in assessing the best interests of the children (BIOC) because the officer did not adequately consider scenarios where remaining in Canada would be in the children’s best interests, instead focusing on whether removal would cause significant negative impacts and requiring proof of hardship – an incorrect approach.",
      "The court emphasized that an officer must be “alert, alive and sensitive” to the child’s best interests, considering the child’s circumstances from their perspective, and that the officer failed to do so by unreasonably dismissing objective evidence of potential risks in Mexico.",
      "The court determined the officer’s reasoning was flawed by repeatedly referencing “significant negative impact” and introducing a hardship threshold, which is inappropriate in a BIOC assessment.",
      "The court granted the application for judicial review and ordered the matter be re-determined by a different officer, finding the officer’s error regarding the BIOC was sufficient grounds for review, and declined to certify the proposed question of general importance as it was not dispositive of the case and had been previously declined by the court in similar cases."
