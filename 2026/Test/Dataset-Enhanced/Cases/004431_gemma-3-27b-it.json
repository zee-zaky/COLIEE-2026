    "[1]\nMactavish, J.\n: Patricia Henguva's refugee claim was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board on the basis that there was an internal flight alternative [IFA] available to her in Namibia. While the Board accepted that Ms. Henguva had been victimized by a member of a powerful tribal family in her home town, it was nevertheless satisfied that state protection would be available to Ms. Henguva in the city of Walvis Bay.",
    "[2]\nAt the conclusion of the hearing I advised the parties that I was granting the application for judicial review on the basis that the Board applied the wrong test for state protection. These are my reasons for coming to that decision.\nAnalysis",
    "[3]\nThe Board started its state protection analysis by noting that states need only provide adequate state protection and do not have to provide perfect protection. This is the correct formulation of the test:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 399\n.",
    "[4]\nHowever, the Board then went on to restate its understanding of the test in its own words, stating \"in other words, home states\nonly need to make serious efforts at protection\nand do not have to provide\nde facto\neffective or\nde facto\nguaranteed protection\" [my emphasis].",
    "[5]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] F.C.J. No. 1637, precisely the same language was used by the Board to describe the test for state protection. This Court found that in so doing, the Board erred. The Court observed that \"[t]he use of the phrase \"in other words\" in the passage was incorrect. It went on to observe that \"'adequate protection' and 'serious efforts at protection' are not the same thing.\" The Court stated that adequate protection \"is concerned with whether the actual outcome of protection exists in a given country, while [serious efforts] merely indicates whether the state has taken steps to provide that protection\": all quotes from para. 27.",
    "[6]\nI agree with the respondent that the use of the phrase \"serious efforts\" in a state protection analysis will not automatically result in a Board decision being set aside, and that regard must be had to the decision as a whole in determining whether or not the Board applied the proper test.",
    "[7]\nHowever, the use of the phrase \"serious efforts\" in this case is not merely an injudicious choice of language at one point in an otherwise proper analysis. Having mis-stated the test, the Board went on to identify the issue before it as being \"only whether Namibian authorities in Walvis Bay can reasonably be expected to provide the claimant with\nserious efforts\nat protection ...\" [my emphasis].",
    "[8]\nHaving incorrectly framed the issue before it, the Board then proceeded to discuss whether Ms. Henguva faced a forward-looking risk were she to return to Namibia and live in Walvis Bay. The Board concluded its analysis with the ultimate finding that \"I am not persuaded that ... Namibian authorities would not be reasonably forthcoming with\nserious efforts\nto protect the claimant\": at para. 21 [my emphasis].",
    "[9]\nIt is thus clear from reading the decision as a whole that the Board did not understand or apply the correct legal test in assessing the state protection available to Ms. Henguva in Namibia. As a consequence, the application for judicial review is allowed.",
    "[10]\nBefore closing, I note that this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have repeatedly stated that it is an error for the Board to focus on the efforts made by a government to protect its citizens without considering whether those efforts have actually translated into adequate state protection: see, for example,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J.

No. 399. Given the clear judicial guidance that has been provided on this issue, it is troubling to see the Board continue to make the same error.\nConclusion",
    "[11]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed. I agree with the parties that the case does not raise a question for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[12]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES\nthat\nthis application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel for re-determination.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Refugee Protection Section of the Immigration and Refugee Board has rejected the asylum application presented by Ms. Patricia Henguva, on the grounds that the latter had at her disposal an internal refuge option (IRP) in Namibia. Although the Commission recognized the fact that Ms. Henguva had been assaulted by a member of a powerful tribal family in her home town, it was nonetheless satisfied that Ms. Henguva would be able to avail herself of state protection in the town of Walvis Bay. [2]\nAt the end of the hearing, I advised the parties that I was granting the application for judicial review, because the Commission had not applied the correct test for state protection. Here are the reasons why I reached this decision.\nAnalysis [3]\nThe Commission began its analysis of state protection by noting that states need only provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection. This is the correct formulation of the criterion:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACF no 399. [4]\nHowever, the Commission then reformulated its interpretation of the criterion in its own words, stating the following: In other words, [the States of origin]\nmust make serious efforts to protect their citizens\n, but they do not, in fact, have to offer effective protection or guarantee it. [Emphasis added.] [5]\nThese are the exact terms that the Commission used in the decision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no 1637, to describe the applicable test with regard to state protection. The Court concluded that the Commission had erred and noted that the Commission was wrong to say \"[i]n other words\" in this passage. She then mentioned that adequate protection and serious efforts to protect [the] citizens are two different things. Adequate protection concerns whether protection is actually provided in a given country, while [serious efforts] only tell us whether the state has taken measures to guarantee this protection. All these quotes are taken from paragraph 27 of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision. [6]\nI agree with the Respondent that the use of the term serious efforts in the context of a state protection analysis will not automatically result in the Board's decision being overturned, and that the Court will have to consider the decision as a whole in deciding whether or not the Board applied the correct test. [7]\nHowever, the use of the term serious efforts in this case is not simply an injudicious use in one place in the context of an otherwise adequate analysis. The Commission, which had not correctly stated the test, then noted that the only issue before it was whether it would be reasonable to expect that the Namibian authorities at Walvis Bay would be able to\nserious efforts\nto ensure protection [...]. [Emphasis added.] [8]\nThe Commission, having incorrectly formulated the issue before it, then proceeded to discuss whether Ms Henguva was exposed to a prospective risk in the event that she were to return to Namibia and take up residence at Walvis Bay. The Commissioner concluded his analysis with the following final conclusion, at paragraph 21: [I]m not satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the Namibian authorities at Walvis Bay would not reasonably be able to deploy\nserious efforts\nto ensure the protection of the asylum seeker. [Emphasis added.] [9]\nThere is therefore no doubt, reading the decision as a whole, that the Commission did not understand what the legal test was or that it did not apply the correct legal test in assessing the state protection that would be offered to Ms Henguva in Namibia. Therefore, the application for judicial review will be granted. [10]\nBefore concluding, I would note that the Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have repeatedly stated that the Commission errs when it focuses on the efforts made by a government to protect its citizens and ignores the question of whether those efforts had, in fact, truly resulted in adequate state protection: see, for example,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2001] ACF no. 135, at paragraph 9;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no. 358, at paragraph 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] ACF no 851, at paragraph 8;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no (QL), at paragraph 60;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] ACF no. 955, at paragraphs 21 to 28;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2011] ACF no. 1663, at paragraph 16;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCA No. 399. Given the unequivocal judicial guidance that has been provided on this issue, it is concerning that the Commission continues to make the same error.\nConclusion [11]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review will be granted. I agree with the parties that this matter does not raise a question to be certified.\nJUDGMENT [12]\nTHE COURT RULES that\nthis application for judicial review is granted and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted tribunal for further decision.\n[End of document]"

I agree with the parties that the case does not raise a question for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n[12]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES\nthat\nthis application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is remitted to a differently constituted panel for re-determination.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté la demande d'asile présentée par Mme Patricia Henguva, au motif que cette dernière avait à sa disposition une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI) en Namibie. Bien que la Commission ait reconnu le fait que Mme Henguva avait été agressée par un membre d'une puissante famille tribale dans sa ville d'origine, elle était néanmoins convaincue que Mme Henguva pourrait se prévaloir de la protection de l'État dans la ville de Walvis Bay.\n[2]\nÀ la fin de l'audience, j'ai avisé les parties que j'accueillais la demande de contrôle judiciaire, parce que la Commission n'avait pas appliqué le bon critère en matière de protection de l'État. Voici les motifs pour lesquels je suis parvenue à cette décision.\nAnalyse\n[3]\nLa Commission a amorcé son analyse relative à la protection de l'État en faisant remarquer que les États n'ont seulement qu'à fournir une protection adéquate et qu'ils n'ont pas à assurer une protection parfaite. Il s'agit de la bonne formulation du critère:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 399.\n[4]\nCependant, la Commission a ensuite reformulé en ses propres mots son interprétation du critère, en mentionnant ce qui suit:  En d'autres termes, [les États d'origine]\ndoivent déployer de sérieux efforts pour protéger leurs citoyens\n, mais ils n'ont pas, de fait, à offrir une protection efficace ni à en garantir une . [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[5]\nIl s'agit des termes exacts que la Commission avait employés dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 1637, pour décrire le critère applicable en ce qui concerne la protection de l'État. La Cour a conclu que la Commission avait commis une erreur et elle a fait remarquer que la Commission  avait eu tort de dire \"[e]n d'autres termes\" dans ce passage . Elle a ensuite mentionné que la  protection adéquate  et les  sérieux efforts pour protéger [les] citoyens  sont deux choses différentes. La protection adéquate  concerne la question de savoir si la protection est effectivement assurée dans un pays donné, tandis que les [sérieux efforts] ne nous renseignent que sur celle de savoir si l'État a pris des mesures afin de garantir cette protection . Toutes ces citations sont tirées du paragraphe 27 de la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[6]\nJe conviens avec le défendeur que l'emploi de l'expression  sérieux efforts  dans le contexte d'une analyse relative à la protection de l'État ne fera pas automatiquement en sorte que la décision de la Commission sera annulée, et que la Cour devra tenir compte de la décision dans son ensemble pour trancher la question de savoir si la Commission a appliqué le bon critère ou non.\n[7]\nCependant, l'emploi de l'expression  sérieux efforts  en l'espèce ne consiste pas simplement en un emploi non judicieux à un endroit dans le cadre d'une analyse par ailleurs adéquate. La Commission, qui n'avait pas énoncé correctement le critère, a ensuite mentionné que la seule question en litige dont elle était saisie  consist[ait] à savoir s'il serait raisonnable de s'attendre à ce que les autorités de la Namibie à Walvis Bay soient en mesure de faire de\nsérieux efforts\npour assurer la protection [...] . [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[8]\nLa Commission, ayant incorrectement formulé la question en litige dont elle était saisie, a ensuite discuté de la question de savoir si Mme Henguva était exposée à un risque prospectif dans l'éventualité où elle devait retourner en Namibie et s'établir à Walvis Bay. Le commissaire a conclu son analyse avec la conclusion finale suivante, au paragraphe 21:  [J]e ne suis pas convaincu que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, les autorités namibiennes à Walvis Bay ne seraient pas raisonnablement en mesure de déployer de\nsérieux efforts\npour assurer la protection de la demandeure d'asile . [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[9]\nIl ne fait donc aucun doute, à la lecture de la décision dans son ensemble, que la Commission n'a pas compris quel était le critère juridique ou qu'elle n'a pas appliqué le bon critère juridique pour apprécier la protection de l'État qui serait offerte à Mme Henguva en Namibie. Par conséquent, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie.\n[10]\nAvant de conclure, je ferais remarquer que la Cour et la Cour d'appel fédérale ont énoncé à maintes reprises que la Commission commet une erreur lorsqu'elle porte son attention sur les efforts déployés par un gouvernement pour protéger ses citoyens et qu'elle ne tient pas compte de la question de savoir si ces efforts avaient, dans les faits, véritablement engendré une protection adéquate de l'État: voir, à titre d'exemple,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] ACF no 135, au paragraphe 9;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 358, au paragraphe 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 851, au paragraphe 8;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no (QL), au paragraphe 60;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] ACF no 955, aux paragraphes 21 à 28;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2011] ACF no 1663, au paragraphe 16;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] ACF no 399. Compte tenu des directives judiciaires sans équivoque qui ont été fournies quant à cette question, il est préoccupant de voir que la Commission continue de commettre la même erreur.\nConclusion\n[11]\nPour ces motifs, la demande de contrôle judiciaire sera accueillie. Je conviens avec les parties que la présente affaire ne soulève pas de question à certifier.\nJUGEMENT\n[12]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla présente demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie et que l'affaire est renvoyée à un tribunal différemment constitué pour nouvelle décision.\n[End of document]",

      "Applicants": [
        "The Refugee Protection Division erred in applying the test for state protection.",
        "The Board incorrectly stated the test for state protection, focusing on 'serious efforts' rather than 'adequate protection'.",
        "The Board framed the issue before it as whether Namibian authorities could make 'serious efforts' at protection, rather than whether adequate protection existed.",
        "The Board’s conclusion focused on whether Namibian authorities would make 'serious efforts' to protect the claimant, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the legal test.",
        "The Board repeatedly makes the same error of focusing on governmental efforts without considering whether those efforts translate into adequate protection."

        "The use of the phrase 'serious efforts' in a state protection analysis does not automatically invalidate a Board decision; the decision as a whole must be considered.",

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The core error identified by the court was the Refugee Protection Division’s (the Board) misapplication of the legal test for determining adequate state protection. While acknowledging the correct starting point – that states need only provide *adequate* protection, not *perfect* protection – the Board repeatedly equated ‘adequate protection’ with ‘serious efforts at protection.’",
      "The court relied on prior case law (specifically *[2012] F.C.J. No. 1637*) which had already established that 'adequate protection' and 'serious efforts at protection' are distinct concepts; adequacy concerns the *outcome* of protection, while serious efforts relate only to the *steps* taken to provide it.",
      "The court found that the Board’s repeated use of the phrase “serious efforts” wasn’t merely a linguistic slip but fundamentally shaped its analysis. The Board framed the central issue as whether Namibian authorities *would make serious efforts* to protect the claimant, rather than whether they *would actually provide adequate* protection.",
      "This misframing led the Board to conclude that it was “not persuaded that Namibian authorities would not be reasonably forthcoming with serious efforts,” a finding that directly addressed the incorrectly posed question and avoided assessing whether those efforts would translate into actual, adequate protection.",
      "The court emphasized a consistent line of judicial guidance (citing multiple previous cases) stressing the importance of evaluating the *actual outcome* of protection efforts, not just the efforts themselves. The court expressed concern that the Board continued to make this error despite this established guidance.",
      "Consequently, the court granted the application for judicial review because the Board failed to apply the correct legal test, rendering its decision flawed. The case was remitted to a differently constituted panel for re-determination."
