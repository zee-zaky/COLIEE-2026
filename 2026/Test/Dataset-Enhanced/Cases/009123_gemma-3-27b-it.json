    "[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: Liru Yang claims refugee status in Canada on the grounds that she fears persecution if she returns to China. She says that she follows Falun Gong, a practice that the government of China banned in 1999. She states that she came to Vancouver in 2001 to attend a conference and, while here, her mother called from China to say that security officers had arrested some members of her Falun Gong group and had come looking for her.",
    "[2]\nA panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed Ms. Yang's claim because it disbelieved her testimony. It concluded that she had simply chosen \"a convenient way to become a Canadian resident by claiming refugee status\". It did not believe that she was a follower of Falun Gong in China or that security officials were really pursuing her.",
    "[3]\nMs. Yang has one complaint about the Board's decision: that it failed to consider the possibility that she might be persecuted if she returns to China because of her Falun Gong activities in Canada. She argues that, by this omission, the Board made a serious error and that she is entitled to a new hearing before a different panel.",
    "[4]\nThe Board had scant evidence before it of Ms. Yang's activities in Canada. She made passing reference in her written narrative to practising Falun Gong here. In her oral testimony, she identified a park in North Toronto where she practised, and mentioned attending a celebration of the 10th anniversary of Falun Gong's founding. Based on this evidence, should the Board have specifically considered whether Mr. Yang's activities here might result in persecution in China? In the circumstances of this case, the answer is no.",
    "[5]\nReading its reasons as a whole, I find that the Board clearly rejected all of Ms. Yang's story. It concluded that she \"came to Canada with an ulterior motive\": to make a false refugee claim. Near the end of the hearing, counsel for Ms. Yang attempted to question her further on her Canadian Falun Gong activities, at which point the Boad made clear that it was not interested because any evidence she gave could easily be fabricated. Obviously, Ms. Yang's credibility was in tatters at that point.",
    "[6]\nIn its reasons, the Board carefully outlined its grounds for disbelieving all of Ms. Yang's claim, including her supposed membership in Falun Gong. On this basis, I find that this case differs from those where the Board does not make such a sweeping credibility assessment: see, for example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 647. In Chen, the Board made no finding about the applicant's membership in Falun Gong. Justice O'Keefe, rightly, found that the Board had failed to consider the risk that the Chinese government might mistreat Ms. Chen when she returned to China, even though the Board did not believe that she had actually been persecuted there. Here, by contrast, the Board did not believe that the applicant was even a member of Falun Gong in China. It characterized the entire claim as a sham. I cannot conclude that the Board failed to address any issue of significance.",
    "[7]\nAccordingly, this application for judicial review is dismissed. Counsel did not propose any question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated.\nJUDGMENT",

      "The court found that the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) did not err in dismissing Ms. Yang’s refugee claim. The IRB had explicitly disbelieved Ms. Yang’s entire testimony, concluding her claim was made with an ulterior motive – to gain Canadian residency.",
      "The court distinguished this case from *Chen* (2002 F.C.J. No. 647), where the IRB did not make a comprehensive credibility assessment regarding Falun Gong membership. In *Chen*, the court found a failure to consider potential persecution. Here, the IRB *did* assess credibility and found Ms. Yang was not a Falun Gong member even in China, characterizing the claim as a fabrication.",
      "The court reasoned that because the IRB fundamentally rejected Ms. Yang’s narrative, including her alleged Falun Gong practice in China, it was not required to specifically consider whether her Canadian Falun Gong activities would lead to persecution upon return. The IRB’s skepticism extended to any evidence presented regarding her Canadian activities, deeming it easily fabricated.",
      "The court emphasized that the IRB’s reasons clearly outlined the basis for disbelieving the entire claim, and therefore, the IRB did address all significant issues. The court found no basis to conclude the IRB failed to consider a relevant issue."
