    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nPhelan, J.\nJuly 29, 2005.\nCounsel:\nBoniface Ahunwan, for the applicants;\nBrad Gotkin, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nBoniface Ahunwan, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicants;\nBrad Gotkin, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.",
    "[1]\nPhelan, J.\n: The Applicant (and her minor children) had their claim for refugee status/person in need of protection status dismissed by the Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\") of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The claim was rejected on the basis of the failure to rebut the presumption of state protection in Costa Rica. This is the judicial review of the RPD's decision.\nBackground",
    "[2]\nThe Applicant is a female citizen of Costa Rica. She claimed to have a well-founded fear of her former common law spouse who allegedly abused her and her children.",
    "[3]\nIn November 1998 the Applicant reported her spouse's abuse to the local police. She received no assistance. In December 1998 she attempted to report her spouse to police in a different town. She was advised that they had no jurisdiction in her hometown and that she had to make her report to the local police. She took no further action other than to leave Costa Rica in August 2000.",
    "[4]\nThe RPD held that in a democracy such as Costa Rica, the Applicant must do more than what she did to seek protection, as these were other courses open to her. Her explanation for not seeking assistance from other sources is that she did not believe that she would be protected.",
    "[5]\nThe principal issues raised by the Applicant are (1) whether the RPD failed to consider evidence contrary to the conclusion that Costa Rica provided adequate state protection for abused women; (2) whether the RPD was required to explicitly state its reasons for preferring some evidence over other contrary evidence.\nDetermination",
    "[6]\nBoth parties agree that the standard of review applicable to a determination of the adequacy of state protection is patent unreasonableness. The Court has considered this aspect of the decision on the basis of both patent unreasonableness and reasonableness simpliciter. Unlike my decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 217 (F.C.)(QL) where the Board was required to assess credibility as part of its analysis and was therefore owed a high level of deference, in this instance the RPD was not required to deal with credibility. In any event, the standard of review is not a crucial matter of distinction in this case.",
    "[7]\nWhat is crucial to this case is that the Applicant made only two attempts to seek assistance, one of which was to police who had no local jurisdiction to deal with her complaint. She then formed the opinion that no other assistance would be forthcoming. This purely subjective view of the adequacy of Costa Rica state protection is not \"direct, relevant and compelling\" evidence of the inadequacy of state protection.",
    "[8]\nThe Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.)(QL) imposed a greater obligation to seek assistance where there is a developed democracy:\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state, as in the case at bar, the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.",
    "[9]\nThe determination of adequacy of state protection cannot rest on the subjective fear of an applicant. Whatever the depth of the Applicant's belief, she must do more than she did given the evidence of the nature of the political, judicial and administrative structure of Costa Rica. The RPD's conclusion that the Applicant had \"to do more\" is itself more than reasonable.",
    "[10]\nThe Applicant further argues that the RPD ignored evidence submitted by her tending to show that Costa Rica had difficulty protecting abused women. That evidence included a variety of items such as newspaper articles, an e-mail \"blog\" and a report by a human rights organization on the application of the Convention on Rights of the Child by Costa Rica.",
    "[11]\nDespite counsel's best efforts, the fact remains that there is no evidence that the RPD ignored this contradictory evidence. Not only is there a presumption that a tribunal has considered material submitted to it, in this case, at p. 2 of the decision, there is reference to some of the documents submitted by the Applicant. It cannot be assumed that if the RPD referred to some of this evidence, it must have ignored the rest. Quite the opposite assumption could be made. There simply is no evidence to support the Applicant's contention that the submitted documents were ignored.",
    "[12]\nFinally the Applicant argues that the RPD failed to explain why it preferred some documentary evidence over other contrary evidence. There is no absolute requirement for such an explanation. The circumstances of the case dictate the nature and extent of the duty to give reasons, of which the explanation of the preference for certain evidence is a component. The failure to explain may affect the degree of deference owed and the ability of a court to determine whether the tribunal has met the standard of review to which its decision maybe subject.",
    "[13]\nIn this case, the Applicant's documents are not so compelling as to call for an explanation for rejection. The RPD's preference for other documents can be garnered from a reading of the decision as a whole - it turns on the weight of the preferred evidence, its objectivity and its currency.",
    "[14]\nIn this case as well, the reason for rejecting the Applicant's claim did not rest solely on the preference for certain documentary evidence. It also turned on the Applicant's evidence and her efforts to seek protection.",
    "[15]\nIn my view there are sufficient reasons given which explain the RPD's conclusion. While in many cases further and explicit explanations for favouring certain documents may not only be preferable but required, such is not the case here.",
    "[16]\nFinally, considering the decision as a whole, I can find no reason for the Court to intervene. Therefore this application will be dismissed. No question will be certified.\n[End of document]"

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court upheld the Refugee Protection Division’s (RPD) rejection of the applicant’s claim, finding no patent unreasonableness or unreasonableness in the RPD’s decision. The core reasoning centered on the applicant’s insufficient efforts to seek state protection in Costa Rica.",
      "The court applied the principle established in *Canada (Immigration and Refugee Board) v. Wang*, which dictates a higher burden on claimants seeking refugee status from democratic countries. The applicant was required to demonstrate more than simply unsuccessful initial attempts to report abuse to the police; she needed to exhaust available avenues for assistance.",
      "The court distinguished this case from its prior decision in *[2004] F.C.J. No. 217 (F.C.)(QL)*, noting that the RPD was not required to assess credibility in this instance, simplifying the standard of review.",
      "The court found the applicant’s subjective belief that she would not receive protection insufficient to establish the inadequacy of state protection. Objective evidence of effort was required, and the applicant’s two attempts, one to a non-jurisdictional police force, were deemed inadequate.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the RPD ignored contradictory evidence (newspaper articles, blog posts, human rights reports) submitted by the applicant. It noted a presumption that the RPD considered all submitted material and found reference to some of the documents in the RPD’s decision, precluding a finding of disregard.",
      "The court clarified that there is no absolute requirement for a tribunal to explicitly explain its preference for certain evidence over others. The duty to provide reasons is contextual, and the RPD’s decision provided sufficient reasoning based on the weight, objectivity, and currency of the evidence considered, as well as the applicant’s own actions.",
      "The court determined that the RPD’s conclusion was reasonably based on both the applicant’s limited efforts to seek protection and the weight given to the evidence regarding the Costa Rican political, judicial, and administrative structure."
