    "[0]\nDate:\n20160815\nDocket: T-1049-16\nCitation:\n2016 FC 934\nOttawa, Ontario, August 15, 2016\nPRESENT: Madam Prothonotary Mireille Tabib\nBETWEEN:\nADE OLUMIDE\nApplicant\nand\nATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF CANADA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF SASKATCHEWAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NOVA\nSCOTIA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW BRUNSWICK, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MANITOBA,\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF NUNAVUT, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF ALBERTA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF YUKON, MINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nRespondents\nORDER AND REASONS",
    "[1]\nThe Applicant filed a 31 page Notice of\nApplication on June 4, 2016, naming as Respondents the Attorney General of\nCanada, the Attorneys General of Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,\nManitoba, Nunavut, British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon, and the Minister of\nNational Revenue.",
    "[2]\nThe Notice of Application states that it is\nbrought pursuant to s. 41 of the Access to Information\nAct, Act re June 3, 2016 Information Commissioner Report re Minister of\nNational Revenue s. 10(2) Act (), but that it is also brought pursuant to 18.1(a,b) 57 Federal Courts Act, 64 Federal\nCourts Rules, s. 42(1a) Canada Revenue Agency CRA Act, s. 24 Charter right to\nremedy for s. 12 Charter breach () followed by a further list of\ndisjointed references to other legislative provisions.",
    "[3]\nThe Application seeks the following relief:\nDeclaratory relief that s. 10(2) Access to Information Act shall\nread in a case of safety, security, criminal law, economic interest after\nwords may but is not required, in alternative, s 10(2) Privacy Act shall be\nread down, the Attorney General shall have 12 months to cure inconsistency, AND\nprovincial Attorney Generals for Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,\nManitoba, Nunavut, of British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon shall remedy any legislation\nthat regulates access to information gathered as a result of an s57 Federal\nCourts Act notice, AND pursuant to s39 Act Commissioner may make a special\nreport to Parliament on s10(2).",
    "[4]\nOn July 25, 2016, the Applicant served and filed\na motion record on a motion to amend his Notice of Application to include relief re July 4, 2016 report of the Information\nCommissioner and other relief. This motion was made for determination\nin writing, pursuant to Rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules.",
    "[5]\nOn August 3, 2016, the Respondents Attorney\nGeneral of Canada and Minister of National Revenue (hereafter referred to\nsimply as the Attorney General), filed a motion record on a motion to strike\nthe Application. That motion was also made for determination in writing pursuant\nto Rule 369. On August 4, 2016, the Attorney General served a responding record\nto the Applicants motion to amend, as well as amended written representations\non its motion to strike.",
    "[6]\nOn August 5, 2016, the Applicant filed a\nresponse to the Attorney Generals motion to strike (Reply\nto Respondent Motion to Strike served on August 4, 2016 around 3 pm)\nthat appears to refer to and take into account the amended written\nrepresentations served August 4, 2016. The Applicant also served on August 5,\n2016 an other motion record that appears to be a reply to the Attorney\nGenerals response to the Applicants motion to amend (Motion\nRecord (Reply)) and a document requesting that both the Applicants\nmotion to amend and the Attorney Generals motion to strike be heard\nconcurrently at the General Sittings in Ottawa on August 17, 2016.",
    "[7]\nThe Attorney General filed its reply to the\nApplicants responding record on August 8, 2016. It objects to an oral hearing.",
    "[8]\nFinally, the Applicant filed, on August 8, 2016,\na motion record on a motion pursuant to rules 64, 54\nto be heard at the Ottawa General Sittings on August 17, 2016. That motion\nappears to be a motion to strike the Attorney Generals motion to strike. A\ndocument entitled Supplementary Motion Record (August\n17 Motion) Affidavit  Unprecedented Judicial Errors Against the Interest of\nJuctice (sic) was also filed by the Applicant on August 10, 2016. It is\nunclear whether that supplementary motion record is in support of his latter\nmotion or to supplement his response to the Attorney Generals motion to\nstrike.",
    "[9]\nThe first matter to be determined is whether the\nApplicants motion to amend and the Attorney Generals motion to strike should\nbe heard orally, as requested by the Applicant, or determined on the basis of\nthe written record.",
    "[10]\nI have considered the reasons why the Court\nmight order an oral hearing of a written motion as set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as well as the reasons set out in the Applicants\nAugust 5 request. The Applicants argument that the issues raise quasi-constitutional right of access for over 30 million\nCanadians is without any apparent merit, as is his assertion that the\nAttorney General has a rich history of falsehoods in\ncourt and abuse of process. While the Applicants written materials are\nprolix, difficult to understand and at times incoherent, the issues raised in\nthe motions themselves are straightforward and the Court would derive no\nbenefit from an oral hearing.",
    "[11]\nI intend to consider first the Applicants\nmotion to amend his Notice of Application.",
    "[12]\nThe Notice of Application initiating this\napplication, filed July 4, 2016, specifically invokes the Federal Courts\njurisdiction to review a refusal of access pursuant to s 41 of the Access to\nInformation Act RSC 1985 c A-1 (ATIA). The refusal identified in\nthe original Notice of Application concerns the Applicants request for records\nof certain telephone calls to or from a certain CRA employee, and CRAs\nresponse that no such records were found. The Information Commissioners report\nof investigation dated June 3, 2016, pursuant to which the application purports\nto be instituted, concluded that no such records existed. As mentioned, the\nNotice of Application also seeks various declaratory reliefs in respect of the\ninterpretation and application of s 10(2) of the ATIA.",
    "[13]\nThe motion to amend has two distinct purposes.\nFirst, it seeks to include a prayer for relief in respect of a second report of\nthe information Commissioner, dated July 4, 2016. That report relates to a\nrequest for information relating to the training attended and audits performed\nby a different CRA employee. The CRAs refusal in respect of that request was\nnot based on the non-existence of records but on an exemption under subsection\n19(1) of the ATIA. The grounds the Applicant proposes to raise in an\namended notice of application are entirely separate and distinct from those\nraised in the original Notice of Application.",
    "[14]\nWithout pronouncing on or considering the merits\nof the original application or of the proposed amendments, it is obvious that\nthere is no commonality between the original application and the proposed\nadditions other than the fact that they relate to access to information\nrequests made to the CRA. The motion to amend is essentially a motion to\nconsolidate in the existing application an application that could and, if it\nhas any merit, should have been the subject of a distinct application.\nAmendments may be permitted where they would help determine the real question\nin controversy, where they would not create an injustice that cannot be\ncompensated by costs and where it would serve the interest of justice ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Adding a new and unrelated application for review\nto the existing application would clearly distract from, rather than assist in,\ndetermining any question in controversy in the first application. There is no\nbasis to permit the Applicant to amend so as to effect a de facto consolidation\nof a new and separate application into an existing application. To do so is to\ninvite litigants to use applications as a pipeline in which to funnel any and\nall grievances they may have against a respondent as they arise, whether or not\nthey are related, and is clearly not in the interest of justice.",
    "[15]\nThe second purpose of the amendment is to add\narguments in respect of a bill to amend Saskatchewans access to information\nlegislation. It is plain and obvious that this Court has no jurisdiction over\nprovincial legislatures or legislation and that the proposed amendments cannot\nform the basis of any arguable case.",
    "[16]\nThe Court notes that in his reply submissions,\nthe Applicant proposes yet further amendments to his Notice of Application.\nNone addresses or cures the flaws identified above. The Applicants motion to\namend is, accordingly, dismissed.",
    "[17]\nI now turn to the Attorney Generals motion to\nstrike.",
    "[18]\nTo the extent the application is an application\npursuant to s 41 of the ATIA for judicial review of the CRAs refusal to\ndisclose the telephone records requested, I am satisfied that it is plain and\nobvious that it cannot succeed. Our Court has made it clear on a number of\noccasions that where, in response to a request for information (whether under\nthe ATIA or the Privacy Act, RSC 1985 c P-21), a department\nresponds that a record does not exist, such a response does not constitute a\nrefusal of access. Absent a refusal, the Court does not have jurisdiction in\njudicial review pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA or the Privacy Act,\nunless there is some evidence, beyond mere suspicion, that records do exist and\nhave been withheld.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[19]\nAs mentioned, it is plain that the refusal\nhere is based on the CRAs conclusion that no records such as those requested\nexist, and the Information Commissioners report of investigation agrees with\nthat conclusion. No evidence, or even cogent argument, has been submitted by\nthe Applicant to support a conclusion that the records exist or are being\nwithheld. It is plain and obvious that this Court can have no jurisdiction in\nthis matter pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA.",
    "[20]\nTo the extent the Notice of Application is an\napplication for a declaration pursuant to s18.1 of the Federal Courts\nAct, I am also satisfied that it is plain and obvious that it cannot\nsucceed. The application takes issue with s 10(2) of the ATIA, which\nreads as follows:\n10 (1) Where\nthe head of a government institution refuses to give access to a record\nrequested under this Act or a part thereof, the head of the institution\nshall state in the notice given under paragraph 7(a)\n(a) that the record does not exist, or\n(b) the specific provision of this Act on which the refusal was\nbased or, where the head of the institution does not indicate whether a\nrecord exists, the provision on which a refusal could reasonably be expected\nto be based if the record existed,\nand shall state\nin the notice that the person who made the request has a right to make a\ncomplaint to the Information Commissioner about the refusal.\n(2) The head of a government institution may but is not\nrequired to indicate under subsection (1) whether a record exists.\n10 (1) En cas de\nrefus de communication totale ou partielle dun document demandé en vertu\nde la présente loi, lavis prévu à lalinéa 7a) doit mentionner, dune\npart, le droit de la personne qui a fait la demande de déposer une plainte\nauprès du Commissaire à linformation et, dautre part :\na) soit le fait que le document nexiste pas;\nb) soit la disposition précise de la présente loi sur laquelle se\nfonde le refus ou, sil nest pas fait état de lexistence du document, la\ndisposition sur laquelle il pourrait vraisemblablement se fonder si le\ndocument existait.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) noblige pas le responsable de linstitution\nfédérale à faire état de lexistence du document demandé.\n[Emphasis added.]",
    "[21]\nAlthough difficult to follow and at times\nincoherent, the Notice of Application appears to argue that the ability of\ngovernment departments to rely on s 10(2) of the ATIA to refuse to\nindicate whether or not documents exist breaches s 12 of the Charter of\nRights and Freedoms and other legislative provisions, because it somehow\nallows them to hide evidence. The sole relief sought is the above mentioned\ndeclaration as to how s 10(2) should be read, an order that the Attorney\nGeneral cure the inconsistency within 12 months, that the Attorneys General\nof the named provinces and territories remedy their corresponding\nlegislations and that the Information Commissioner make a special report to\nParliament on s 10(2) of the ATIA.",
    "[22]\nFirst, it is abundantly clear that this Court\nhas no jurisdiction in respect of the relief sought against the Attorneys\nGeneral of the provinces and territories",
    "[23]\nWith respect to the declaration sought as to the\nmanner in which s 10(2) of the ATIA should be read and applied, the\nfatal flaw is that the remedy is purely theoretical. The declaration does not\nflow from the review of any decision, order or action of a federal board,\ncommission or other tribunal. The CRAs answer to the Applicants request for\naccess expressly stated that the records did not exist, and accordingly plainly\ndid not invoke the application of s 10(2) of the ATIA. Neither the CRAs\nresponse to the request for access nor the Information Commissioners\ninvestigation and report engaged the application of s 10(2) of the ATIA.\nThe Courts jurisdiction pursuant to s 18 and 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act\nto grant relief against any federal board, commission\nor other tribunal or in respect of a decision or order of a federal\nboard, commission or other tribunal cannot therefore be invoked or engaged in\nthe circumstances. I have noted that the Notice of Application alleges that the\nInformation Commissioners Report shows that for about\n3 years CRA has relied and is relying on s 10(2) to prevent the applicant from\nreceiving all the records to which he is entitled. However, this\nassertion is patently unsupported on the very face of the report on which it\npurports to be based. I am satisfied that the Courts jurisdiction in judicial\nreview is not properly engaged in this matter.",
    "[24]\nThe Applicant invokes Rule 64 of the Federal\nCourts Rules, to the effect that proceedings are not subject to challenge\non the ground that only a declaratory order is sought, and that the Court may\nmake a binding declaration of right in a proceeding whether or not any\nconsequential relief is or can be claimed. However, as found in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  citing  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the rule does not permit an applicant to simply\ntack a constitutional challenge onto an improperly brought application. There\nmust be some basis on which the application is brought and not merely some\nabstract desire to obtain clarification.",
    "[25]\nGiven the conclusion above that the Notice of\nApplication cannot possibly succeed as an application pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA\nor as a judicial review application, the request for declaratory relief of\nunconstitutionality is a request for a bare declaration of unconstitutionality\nwithout any factual foundation whatsoever and cannot succeed. This would be so\neven if the Applicant had brought the proceeding as an action rather than an\napplication ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It\nis plain and obvious that this is not one of these exceptional cases where\nunconstitutionality can be determined as a pure question of law. Indeed, I note\nthat the Notice of Application purports to have some factual foundation, but\nthat that foundation is entirely made of serious, unfounded and speculative\nallegations of fraud, cover-ups, discrimination and lies. In this respect, the\nNotice of Application is also abusive, scandalous, frivolous and vexatious.",
    "[26]\nI am satisfied that the Notice of Application\nshould be struck because it is devoid of any chance of success whatsoever, and\nfurther because it is abusive, scandalous and vexatious.",
    "[27]\nI note that none of the amendments proposed in\nthe Applicants motion to amend, in his reply to that motion or in his response\nto the Attorney Generals motion to strike would cure the defects noted in\nthese reasons. I am also satisfied that no amendment could possibly cure these\ndefects, such that the application will be struck without leave to amend.",
    "[28]\nGiven my determination that this application\nshould be struck without leave to amend, the Applicants motion filed August 8,\n2016 is moot and will be dismissed. As mentioned earlier, this motion and the\nsupplementary record filed August 10, 2016 appear to argue that the Attorney\nGenerals motion to strike should be struck. If possible, this material is even\nmore incoherent and the allegations and accusations made therein even more\ninflammatory and abusive than the Applicants previous submissions. To the\nextent this material was intended to set out new grounds to dismiss or strike\nthe Attorney Generals motion to strike, these grounds should have been\nincluded in the Applicants responding record. The Applicants attempt to put\nthese arguments before the Court in a supplementary record or in a motion\npresentable orally, and after the Attorney General has filed its reply, is a\ntransparent attempt to bootstrap his request for an oral hearing of the motion\nto strike, is abusive and should not be permitted.",
    "[29]\nOut of an abundance of caution, however, I have\nconsidered these materials to attempt to discern whether they might contain any\nreasonable defence to the motion to strike that might justify the Court hearing\nthe motion prior to dismissing the application. I have found nothing of merit.\nORDER\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that:\n1.\nThe Applicants motion to amend is dismissed;\n2.\nThe motion of the Attorney General of Canada and\nof the Minister of National Revenue to strike the Notice of Application is\ngranted;\n3.\nThe Notice of Application is struck, without\nleave to amend;\n4.\nThe Applicants motion pursuant to Rules 64 and\n54 made returnable on August 17, 2016 is dismissed as moot;\n5.\nCosts of the motion to strike shall be payable\nby the Applicant to the Respondents Attorney General of Canada and Minister of\nNational Revenue, in the amount of $1100.\n\"Mireille Tabib\"\nProthonotary\nFEDERAL\nCOURT\nSOLICITORS\nOF RECORD\nDOCKET:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF NEW BRUNSWICK, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MANITOBA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF\nNUNAVUT, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALBERTA,\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF YUKON, MINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nMOTION IN\nWRITING CONSIDERED AT OTTAWA, ONTARIO, PURSUANT TO RULE 369 OF THE FEDERAL\nCOURTS RULES\nJUDGMENT AND REASONS:\nTABIB P.\nDATED:\nAugust 15, 2016\nWRITTEN REPRESENTATIONS BY:\nMr. Ade Olumide\nFor\nThe APPLICANT\nMr. Daniel Caron\nFor\nThe RESPONDENTS\n(ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF CANADA\nAND\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE)\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD:\nMr. Ade Olumide\nDunrobin, Ontario\nFor\nThe APPLICANT\nWilliam F.

This motion was made for determination\nin writing, pursuant to Rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules.\n[5]\nOn August 3, 2016, the Respondents Attorney\nGeneral of Canada and Minister of National Revenue (hereafter referred to\nsimply as the Attorney General), filed a motion record on a motion to strike\nthe Application. That motion was also made for determination in writing pursuant\nto Rule 369. On August 4, 2016, the Attorney General served a responding record\nto the Applicants motion to amend, as well as amended written representations\non its motion to strike.\n[6]\nOn August 5, 2016, the Applicant filed a\nresponse to the Attorney Generals motion to strike (Reply\nto Respondent Motion to Strike served on August 4, 2016 around 3 pm)\nthat appears to refer to and take into account the amended written\nrepresentations served August 4, 2016. The Applicant also served on August 5,\n2016 an other motion record that appears to be a reply to the Attorney\nGenerals response to the Applicants motion to amend (Motion\nRecord (Reply)) and a document requesting that both the Applicants\nmotion to amend and the Attorney Generals motion to strike be heard\nconcurrently at the General Sittings in Ottawa on August 17, 2016.\n[7]\nThe Attorney General filed its reply to the\nApplicants responding record on August 8, 2016. It objects to an oral hearing.\n[8]\nFinally, the Applicant filed, on August 8, 2016,\na motion record on a motion pursuant to rules 64, 54\nto be heard at the Ottawa General Sittings on August 17, 2016. That motion\nappears to be a motion to strike the Attorney Generals motion to strike. A\ndocument entitled Supplementary Motion Record (August\n17 Motion) Affidavit  Unprecedented Judicial Errors Against the Interest of\nJuctice (sic) was also filed by the Applicant on August 10, 2016. It is\nunclear whether that supplementary motion record is in support of his latter\nmotion or to supplement his response to the Attorney Generals motion to\nstrike.\n[9]\nThe first matter to be determined is whether the\nApplicants motion to amend and the Attorney Generals motion to strike should\nbe heard orally, as requested by the Applicant, or determined on the basis of\nthe written record.\n[10]\nI have considered the reasons why the Court\nmight order an oral hearing of a written motion as set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as well as the reasons set out in the Applicants\nAugust 5 request. The Applicants argument that the issues raise quasi-constitutional right of access for over 30 million\nCanadians is without any apparent merit, as is his assertion that the\nAttorney General has a rich history of falsehoods in\ncourt and abuse of process.

The sole relief sought is the above mentioned\ndeclaration as to how s 10(2) should be read, an order that the Attorney\nGeneral cure the inconsistency within 12 months, that the Attorneys General\nof the named provinces and territories remedy their corresponding\nlegislations and that the Information Commissioner make a special report to\nParliament on s 10(2) of the ATIA.\n[22]\nFirst, it is abundantly clear that this Court\nhas no jurisdiction in respect of the relief sought against the Attorneys\nGeneral of the provinces and territories\n[23]\nWith respect to the declaration sought as to the\nmanner in which s 10(2) of the ATIA should be read and applied, the\nfatal flaw is that the remedy is purely theoretical. The declaration does not\nflow from the review of any decision, order or action of a federal board,\ncommission or other tribunal. The CRAs answer to the Applicants request for\naccess expressly stated that the records did not exist, and accordingly plainly\ndid not invoke the application of s 10(2) of the ATIA. Neither the CRAs\nresponse to the request for access nor the Information Commissioners\ninvestigation and report engaged the application of s 10(2) of the ATIA.\nThe Courts jurisdiction pursuant to s 18 and 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act\nto grant relief against any federal board, commission\nor other tribunal or in respect of a decision or order of a federal\nboard, commission or other tribunal cannot therefore be invoked or engaged in\nthe circumstances. I have noted that the Notice of Application alleges that the\nInformation Commissioners Report shows that for about\n3 years CRA has relied and is relying on s 10(2) to prevent the applicant from\nreceiving all the records to which he is entitled. However, this\nassertion is patently unsupported on the very face of the report on which it\npurports to be based. I am satisfied that the Courts jurisdiction in judicial\nreview is not properly engaged in this matter.\n[24]\nThe Applicant invokes Rule 64 of the Federal\nCourts Rules, to the effect that proceedings are not subject to challenge\non the ground that only a declaratory order is sought, and that the Court may\nmake a binding declaration of right in a proceeding whether or not any\nconsequential relief is or can be claimed. However, as found in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  citing  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the rule does not permit an applicant to simply\ntack a constitutional challenge onto an improperly brought application. There\nmust be some basis on which the application is brought and not merely some\nabstract desire to obtain clarification.\n[25]\nGiven the conclusion above that the Notice of\nApplication cannot possibly succeed as an application pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA\nor as a judicial review application, the request for declaratory relief of\nunconstitutionality is a request for a bare declaration of unconstitutionality\nwithout any factual foundation whatsoever and cannot succeed. This would be so\neven if the Applicant had brought the proceeding as an action rather than an\napplication ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). It\nis plain and obvious that this is not one of these exceptional cases where\nunconstitutionality can be determined as a pure question of law. Indeed, I note\nthat the Notice of Application purports to have some factual foundation, but\nthat that foundation is entirely made of serious, unfounded and speculative\nallegations of fraud, cover-ups, discrimination and lies. In this respect, the\nNotice of Application is also abusive, scandalous, frivolous and vexatious.\n[26]\nI am satisfied that the Notice of Application\nshould be struck because it is devoid of any chance of success whatsoever, and\nfurther because it is abusive, scandalous and vexatious.\n[27]\nI note that none of the amendments proposed in\nthe Applicants motion to amend, in his reply to that motion or in his response\nto the Attorney Generals motion to strike would cure the defects noted in\nthese reasons. I am also satisfied that no amendment could possibly cure these\ndefects, such that the application will be struck without leave to amend.\n[28]\nGiven my determination that this application\nshould be struck without leave to amend, the Applicants motion filed August 8,\n2016 is moot and will be dismissed. As mentioned earlier, this motion and the\nsupplementary record filed August 10, 2016 appear to argue that the Attorney\nGenerals motion to strike should be struck. If possible, this material is even\nmore incoherent and the allegations and accusations made therein even more\ninflammatory and abusive than the Applicants previous submissions. To the\nextent this material was intended to set out new grounds to dismiss or strike\nthe Attorney Generals motion to strike, these grounds should have been\nincluded in the Applicants responding record. The Applicants attempt to put\nthese arguments before the Court in a supplementary record or in a motion\npresentable orally, and after the Attorney General has filed its reply, is a\ntransparent attempt to bootstrap his request for an oral hearing of the motion\nto strike, is abusive and should not be permitted.\n[29]\nOut of an abundance of caution, however, I have\nconsidered these materials to attempt to discern whether they might contain any\nreasonable defence to the motion to strike that might justify the Court hearing\nthe motion prior to dismissing the application. I have found nothing of merit.\nORDER\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that:\n1.\nThe Applicants motion to amend is dismissed;\n2.\nThe motion of the Attorney General of Canada and\nof the Minister of National Revenue to strike the Notice of Application is\ngranted;\n3.\nThe Notice of Application is struck, without\nleave to amend;\n4.\nThe Applicants motion pursuant to Rules 64 and\n54 made returnable on August 17, 2016 is dismissed as moot;\n5.\nCosts of the motion to strike shall be payable\nby the Applicant to the Respondents Attorney General of Canada and Minister of\nNational Revenue, in the amount of $1100.\n\"Mireille Tabib\"\nProthonotary\nFEDERAL\nCOURT\nSOLICITORS\nOF RECORD\nDOCKET:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF NEW BRUNSWICK, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MANITOBA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF\nNUNAVUT, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALBERTA,\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF YUKON, MINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE\nMOTION IN\nWRITING CONSIDERED AT OTTAWA, ONTARIO, PURSUANT TO RULE 369 OF THE FEDERAL\nCOURTS RULES\nJUDGMENT AND REASONS:\nTABIB P.\nDATED:\nAugust 15, 2016\nWRITTEN REPRESENTATIONS BY:\nMr. Ade Olumide\nFor\nThe APPLICANT\nMr. Daniel Caron\nFor\nThe RESPONDENTS\n(ATTORNEY\nGENERAL OF CANADA\nAND\nMINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE)\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD:\nMr. Ade Olumide\nDunrobin, Ontario\nFor\nThe APPLICANT\nWilliam F.

This motion was made for determination\nin writing, pursuant to Rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules.\n\n[5]\nOn August 3, 2016, the Respondents Attorney\nGeneral of Canada and Minister of National Revenue (hereafter referred to\nsimply as the Attorney General), filed a motion record on a motion to strike\nthe Application. That motion was also made for determination in writing pursuant\nto Rule 369. On August 4, 2016, the Attorney General served a responding record\nto the Applicants motion to amend, as well as amended written representations\non its motion to strike.\n\n[6]\nOn August 5, 2016, the Applicant filed a\nresponse to the Attorney Generals motion to strike (Reply\nto Respondent Motion to Strike served on August 4, 2016 around 3 pm)\nthat appears to refer to and take into account the amended written\nrepresentations served August 4, 2016. The Applicant also served on August 5,\n2016 an other motion record that appears to be a reply to the Attorney\nGenerals response to the Applicants motion to amend (Motion\nRecord (Reply)) and a document requesting that both the Applicants\nmotion to amend and the Attorney Generals motion to strike be heard\nconcurrently at the General Sittings in Ottawa on August 17, 2016.\n\n[7]\nThe Attorney General filed its reply to the\nApplicants responding record on August 8, 2016. It objects to an oral hearing.\n\n[8]\nFinally, the Applicant filed, on August 8, 2016,\na motion record on a motion pursuant to rules 64, 54\nto be heard at the Ottawa General Sittings on August 17, 2016. That motion\nappears to be a motion to strike the Attorney Generals motion to strike. A\ndocument entitled Supplementary Motion Record (August\n17 Motion) Affidavit  Unprecedented Judicial Errors Against the Interest of\nJuctice (sic) was also filed by the Applicant on August 10, 2016. It is\nunclear whether that supplementary motion record is in support of his latter\nmotion or to supplement his response to the Attorney Generals motion to\nstrike.\n\n[9]\nThe first matter to be determined is whether the\nApplicants motion to amend and the Attorney Generals motion to strike should\nbe heard orally, as requested by the Applicant, or determined on the basis of\nthe written record.\n\n[10]\nI have considered the reasons why the Court\nmight order an oral hearing of a written motion as set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  as well as the reasons set out in the Applicants\nAugust 5 request. The Applicants argument that the issues raise quasi-constitutional right of access for over 30 million\nCanadians is without any apparent merit, as is his assertion that the\nAttorney General has a rich history of falsehoods in\ncourt and abuse of process. While the Applicants written materials are\nprolix, difficult to understand and at times incoherent, the issues raised in\nthe motions themselves are straightforward and the Court would derive no\nbenefit from an oral hearing.\n\n[11]\nI intend to consider first the Applicants\nmotion to amend his Notice of Application.\n\n[12]\nThe Notice of Application initiating this\napplication, filed July 4, 2016, specifically invokes the Federal Courts\njurisdiction to review a refusal of access pursuant to s 41 of the Access to\nInformation Act RSC 1985 c A-1 (ATIA). The refusal identified in\nthe original Notice of Application concerns the Applicants request for records\nof certain telephone calls to or from a certain CRA employee, and CRAs\nresponse that no such records were found. The Information Commissioners report\nof investigation dated June 3, 2016, pursuant to which the application purports\nto be instituted, concluded that no such records existed. As mentioned, the\nNotice of Application also seeks various declaratory reliefs in respect of the\ninterpretation and application of s 10(2) of the ATIA.\n\n[13]\nThe motion to amend has two distinct purposes.\nFirst, it seeks to include a prayer for relief in respect of a second report of\nthe information Commissioner, dated July 4, 2016. That report relates to a\nrequest for information relating to the training attended and audits performed\nby a different CRA employee. The CRAs refusal in respect of that request was\nnot based on the non-existence of records but on an exemption under subsection\n19(1) of the ATIA. The grounds the Applicant proposes to raise in an\namended notice of application are entirely separate and distinct from those\nraised in the original Notice of Application.\n\n[14]\nWithout pronouncing on or considering the merits\nof the original application or of the proposed amendments, it is obvious that\nthere is no commonality between the original application and the proposed\nadditions other than the fact that they relate to access to information\nrequests made to the CRA. The motion to amend is essentially a motion to\nconsolidate in the existing application an application that could and, if it\nhas any merit, should have been the subject of a distinct application.\nAmendments may be permitted where they would help determine the real question\nin controversy, where they would not create an injustice that cannot be\ncompensated by costs and where it would serve the interest of justice ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Adding a new and unrelated application for review\nto the existing application would clearly distract from, rather than assist in,\ndetermining any question in controversy in the first application. There is no\nbasis to permit the Applicant to amend so as to effect a de facto consolidation\nof a new and separate application into an existing application. To do so is to\ninvite litigants to use applications as a pipeline in which to funnel any and\nall grievances they may have against a respondent as they arise, whether or not\nthey are related, and is clearly not in the interest of justice.\n\n[15]\nThe second purpose of the amendment is to add\narguments in respect of a bill to amend Saskatchewans access to information\nlegislation. It is plain and obvious that this Court has no jurisdiction over\nprovincial legislatures or legislation and that the proposed amendments cannot\nform the basis of any arguable case.\n\n[16]\nThe Court notes that in his reply submissions,\nthe Applicant proposes yet further amendments to his Notice of Application.\nNone addresses or cures the flaws identified above. The Applicants motion to\namend is, accordingly, dismissed.\n\n[17]\nI now turn to the Attorney Generals motion to\nstrike.\n\n[18]\nTo the extent the application is an application\npursuant to s 41 of the ATIA for judicial review of the CRAs refusal to\ndisclose the telephone records requested, I am satisfied that it is plain and\nobvious that it cannot succeed. Our Court has made it clear on a number of\noccasions that where, in response to a request for information (whether under\nthe ATIA or the Privacy Act, RSC 1985 c P-21), a department\nresponds that a record does not exist, such a response does not constitute a\nrefusal of access. Absent a refusal, the Court does not have jurisdiction in\njudicial review pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA or the Privacy Act,\nunless there is some evidence, beyond mere suspicion, that records do exist and\nhave been withheld.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[19]\nAs mentioned, it is plain that the refusal\nhere is based on the CRAs conclusion that no records such as those requested\nexist, and the Information Commissioners report of investigation agrees with\nthat conclusion. No evidence, or even cogent argument, has been submitted by\nthe Applicant to support a conclusion that the records exist or are being\nwithheld. It is plain and obvious that this Court can have no jurisdiction in\nthis matter pursuant to s 41 of the ATIA.\n\n[20]\nTo the extent the Notice of Application is an\napplication for a declaration pursuant to s18.1 of the Federal Courts\nAct, I am also satisfied that it is plain and obvious that it cannot\nsucceed. The application takes issue with s 10(2) of the ATIA, which\nreads as follows:\n10 (1) Where\nthe head of a government institution refuses to give access to a record\nrequested under this Act or a part thereof, the head of the institution\nshall state in the notice given under paragraph 7(a)\n(a) that the record does not exist, or\n(b) the specific provision of this Act on which the refusal was\nbased or, where the head of the institution does not indicate whether a\nrecord exists, the provision on which a refusal could reasonably be expected\nto be based if the record existed,\nand shall state\nin the notice that the person who made the request has a right to make a\ncomplaint to the Information Commissioner about the refusal.\n(2) The head of a government institution may but is not\nrequired to indicate under subsection (1) whether a record exists.\n10 (1) En cas de\nrefus de communication totale ou partielle dun document demandé en vertu\nde la présente loi, lavis prévu à lalinéa 7a) doit mentionner, dune\npart, le droit de la personne qui a fait la demande de déposer une plainte\nauprès du Commissaire à linformation et, dautre part :\na) soit le fait que le document nexiste pas;\nb) soit la disposition précise de la présente loi sur laquelle se\nfonde le refus ou, sil nest pas fait état de lexistence du document, la\ndisposition sur laquelle il pourrait vraisemblablement se fonder si le\ndocument existait.\n(2) Le paragraphe (1) noblige pas le responsable de linstitution\nfédérale à faire état de lexistence du document demandé.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n[21]\nAlthough difficult to follow and at times\nincoherent, the Notice of Application appears to argue that the ability of\ngovernment departments to rely on s 10(2) of the ATIA to refuse to\nindicate whether or not documents exist breaches s 12 of the Charter of\nRights and Freedoms and other legislative provisions, because it somehow\nallows them to hide evidence. The sole relief sought is the above mentioned\ndeclaration as to how s 10(2) should be read, an order that the Attorney\nGeneral cure the inconsistency within 12 months, that the Attorneys General\nof the named provinces and territories remedy their corresponding\nlegislations and that the Information Commissioner make a special report to\nParliament on s 10(2) of the ATIA.\n\n[22]\nFirst, it is abundantly clear that this Court\nhas no jurisdiction in respect of the relief sought against the Attorneys\nGeneral of the provinces and territories\n\n[23]\nWith respect to the declaration sought as to the\nmanner in which s 10(2) of the ATIA should be read and applied, the\nfatal flaw is that the remedy is purely theoretical.

      "The Court determined it would rule on the motions based on the written record, finding the issues straightforward and the Applicant’s arguments regarding quasi-constitutional rights and alleged misconduct unsubstantiated and irrelevant to the need for an oral hearing.",
      "The Court dismissed the Applicant’s motion to amend the Notice of Application because the proposed amendments sought to add entirely separate and unrelated claims (a second Information Commissioner report and issues with Saskatchewan legislation) which would effectively consolidate two distinct applications, a practice the Court deemed inappropriate and contrary to the interests of justice.",
      "The Court found it was “plain and obvious” the application for judicial review under s. 41 of the Access to Information Act could not succeed because the CRA responded that the requested records did not exist, which is not considered a ‘refusal’ triggering the Court’s jurisdiction unless evidence suggests records *do* exist and were withheld.",
      "The Court rejected the Applicant’s claim that s. 10(2) of the ATIA (allowing departments to not confirm record existence) violated s. 12 of the Charter, finding the remedy sought was purely theoretical as the CRA’s response hadn’t even invoked that section; the Court’s jurisdiction requires a review of a specific decision or action, which was absent here.",
      "The Court clarified that Rule 64 of the Federal Courts Rules does not allow an applicant to simply attach a constitutional challenge to an improperly initiated application, requiring a valid underlying basis for the claim.",
      "The Court concluded the application was “devoid of any chance of success” and “abusive, scandalous and vexatious,” justifying its striking without leave to amend.",
      "The Court dismissed the Applicant’s motion to strike the Attorney General’s motion to strike as moot, finding it was a transparent attempt to secure an oral hearing and contained further incoherent and inflammatory allegations."
