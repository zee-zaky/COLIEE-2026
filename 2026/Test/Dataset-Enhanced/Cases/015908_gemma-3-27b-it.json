AP.003.",
    "[1]\nRennie, J.\n: The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board), dated June 14, 2011, which held that the applicant was not a Convention (United Nations'\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] Can TS No 6) refugee or person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (\nIRPA\n). For the reasons that follow, the application is granted.\nFacts",
    "[2]\nThe applicant is a citizen of Mexico. He alleges fear of persecution by his father, who allegedly physically and sexually abused him throughout his life, and continued to harass him as an adult, tracking him down wherever he went. The applicant also alleges fear of persecution in Mexico because he is bisexual.",
    "[3]\nThe applicant alleges that his father began abusing him at a young age and also allowed his friends to abuse him. The applicant states that he was afraid to report his father because he was powerful and involved in drug trafficking. The applicant alleges that his father once cut off part of his finger threatening him never to report the abuse. The applicant states his father was also abusive to his mother and sisters.",
    "[4]\nThe applicant alleges that once he left home to study to become a priest, his father would pursue him wherever he went and harass and threaten him. He also alleges that he was assaulted by other individuals at his seminary and was persecuted because members of the church learned of his bisexuality.",
    "[5]\nThe applicant states that one of his sisters committed suicide in November 2004 and the applicant feared his father would kill him because he was the only one who knew that she killed herself because of their father's abuse.",
    "[6]\nThe applicant traveled to the Dominican Republic in 2007 seeking help from priests to flee to the United States (U.S.). He states that he returned to Mexico to obtain a U.S. visa in March 2007 but the visa was refused. Eventually, a priest in Texas offered to pay the applicant's airfare to Canada where the applicant arrived on July 25, 2008. He entered a church in Canada but after a psychological assessment the church did not accept him. Having nowhere to go, and fearing return to Mexico, the applicant made his refugee claim on August 12, 2009.",
    "[7]\nThe applicant was arrested on February 26, 2011 and charged with luring a child, sexual interference and sexual assault. The charges were still pending at the time of the hearing. The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness participated in the refugee hearing.\nDecision Under Review",
    "[8]\nThe Board found that there was no credible basis for the applicant's claim. The Board rejected that the applicant had been assaulted by his father, threatened by anyone in Mexico or that anyone in Mexico was looking to harm the applicant.",
    "[9]\nThe Board noted many inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence, including:\na. His statement that his father sexually abused him was contradicted by his statements to a church psychologist in September 2007 that a neighbour had sexually abused him. The Board further rejected the explanation that the applicant lied because the church would not accept him if he were homosexual, since that same report referred to his attraction to other men.\nb. The Board rejected the claims that the applicant's father was wealthy and powerful, since he was a general labourer and traveled by bus. The applicant could not explain why he did not use his own car and driver. The Board also noted that the father's alleged flight after the neighbours witnessed him abuse the applicant was inconsistent with the father being wealthy and powerful.\nc. The Board found that the applicant gave confusing and inconsistent testimony about his father's alleged involvement in drug trafficking.\nd. The Board found no evidence the applicant's father forced or tried to force the applicant to return home for the nearly two decades after he left home at the age of 19.\ne. The Board found the documentary evidence did not support the applicant's allegation that his father was sexually abusing his sister. The charges against his father, instituted by him on his deceased sister's behalf, were dismissed due to lack of evidence. The Board also noted that the suicide note made no mention of sexual abuse.\nf. The Board found that the applicant's failure to ever pursue charges on his own behalf against his father supported its conclusion he was never abused.\ng. The applicant had given conflicting evidence regarding the date of the incident when the whole family was brought to the police station.\nh. The Board found the applicant tried to embellish his claim by raising new allegations at the hearing that were not in his Personal Information Form (PIF).\ni. The Board found that the applicant's father paying for all his studies was inconsistent with the applicant's assertion that his father hated him. When asked about this, the applicant again advanced a new allegation; that his father wanted him to learn the narcotics business. The Board found this implausible.",
    "[10]\nThe Board also drew negative credibility findings from the applicant's failure to seek protection in the Dominican Republic, his re-availment to Mexico in 2007 and his delay in claiming protection in Canada.",
    "[11]\nRegarding the applicant's fear of Mexican society due to his bisexuality, the Board found that the applicant's actions in Canada did not support a claim of fear of returning to Mexico. The Board noted that he had allegedly engaged in sexual acts with a minor in public, for which he was subject to criminal charges. The Board stated it was not its place to examine the facts of those charges or make a finding of guilt.",
    "[12]\nThe Board concluded that there was no credible basis for the applicant's claim, pursuant to section 107(2) of the\nIRPA\n. The claim was therefore rejected.\nIssue",
    "[13]\nThe applicant presents the following issues:\na. Was the Board's no credible basis finding reasonable?\nb. Was the Board's credibility finding reasonable?\nc. Was the Board's subjective fear finding reasonable?",
    "[14]\nBecause the decision must be set aside on the basis of the first issue the Court need not address the other issues.\nAnalysis",
    "[15]\nThe applicant submits that the Board can only make a no credible basis finding if there is no trustworthy or credible evidence that could support the claim, a finding that the applicant is not credible is insufficient:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The applicant submits that since the Board accepted that he was bisexual it was an error not to consider the documentary evidence of persecution of sexual minorities, this was credible evidence that could support the claim:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[16]\nIn the respondent's Further Memorandum, it abandoned its substantive arguments about the \"no credible basis\" finding and submitted that the Board did not make a finding pursuant to section 107(2). This is clearly wrong; the Board states at paragraph 75:\nIn accordance with section 107(2) of the\nIRPA\nI am required to state that there is no credible basis for this claim. As I find there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Board could have determined the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the claim is rejected.",
    "[17]\nI agree with the applicant that the \"no credible basis\" finding was unreasonable and for that reason the Board's decision must be set aside. While the Board found the applicant not to be credible in relation to his allegations about his father, the Board did accept that he was bisexual. The applicant alleged risk on the ground of his bisexuality and presented extensive documentary evidence on the risk faced by sexual minorities in Mexico. In light of this evidence the Board's conclusion that there was no credible basis for the claim was unreasonable.",
    "[18]\nThe threshold for a finding that there is no credible basis for the claim is a high one, as set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 51:\n... As I have attempted to demonstrate, subs. 69.1(9.1) requires the Board to examine all the evidence and to conclude that the claim has no credible basis only when there is no trustworthy or credible evidence that could support a recognition of the claim.",
    "[19]\nThus, if there is\nany\ncredible or trustworthy evidence that could support a positive determination the Board cannot find there is no credible basis for the claim, even if, ultimately, the Board finds that the claim has not been established on a balance of probabilities.",
    "[20]\nAs the applicant submits, this case is similar to\nSingh\n, above. In that case, while the Board rejected the applicant's testimony about being tortured and found him not to be credible, the Board did not question the applicant's status as a baptized Sikh. Since there was documentary evidence before the Board that baptized Sikhs were at risk of persecution in India, the Court found it was an error to conclude there was no credible basis for the claim without consideration of that evidence. Justice Edmond Blanchard stated at paragraph 26:\nAccordingly, since there was uncontradicted evidence in the file establishing that the applicant was a Sikh priest and where the documentary evidence showed that baptized Sikhs are a group at risk of persecution in India, the Board could not properly find that the applicant's refugee claim had no credible basis.",
    "[21]\nSimilarly in this case, having accepted that the applicant is bisexual, and faced with extensive documentary evidence of persecution of sexual minorities in Mexico, it was unreasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicant's claim had no credible basis.",
    "[22]\nThe respondent argues (in its initial Memorandum) that the documentary evidence is not capable of supporting the applicant's claim because it alone does not support a finding that it is more likely than not that the applicant faces a risk under section 97. However, this submission is at odds with the reasoning in\nSingh\nand conflates the standard under section 107(2) with the standard under section 97: while it may have been reasonably open to the Board to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the applicant would not be at risk because of his bisexuality, that does not mean that it could make a \"no credible basis\" finding in light of credible and trustworthy documentary evidence that persons in the applicant's circumstances are at risk. Because of the presence of this evidence (and the Board's finding that the applicant was bisexual, thus linking him to the alleged risk), the Board was required to weigh the evidence and determine if the claim had been established.",
    "[23]\nThe application for judicial review is granted.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[24]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted. The matter is referred back to the Immigration Refugee Board for reconsideration before a different member of the Board's Refugee Protection Division. No question for certification has been proposed and the Court finds that none arises.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant seeks judicial review of a decision dated June 14, 2011 by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) concluded that he did not have refugee status (\nUnited Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] RT Can no 6) nor that of person to be protected, within the meaning of articles 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).

Pour les motifs qui suivent, la demande est accueillie.\nLes faits\n[2]\nLe demandeur, citoyen du Mexique, dit craindre d'être persécuté par son père, qui l'a censément agressé physiquement et sexuellement durant toute sa vie, et qui a continué à le harceler une fois qu'il est devenu adulte, le poursuivant partout où il allait. Le demandeur craint aussi d'être persécuté au Mexique parce qu'il est bisexuel.\n[3]\nLe demandeur allègue que son père a commencé à abuser de lui quand il était jeune et qu'il a permis aussi à ses amis d'en faire autant. Il craignait de signaler le comportement de son père parce que celui-ci était un homme puissant et impliqué dans le trafic de la drogue. Son père, allègue-t-il, lui a déjà coupé un bout de doigt, en le menaçant de ne jamais signaler les mauvais traitements qu'il lui faisait subir. Il déclare que son père maltraitait aussi sa mère et ses surs.\n[4]\nLe demandeur prétend que lorsqu'il a quitté la maison pour suivre des études en vue de devenir prêtre, son père l'a poursuivi partout où il allait et l'a harcelé et menacé. Il allègue aussi qu'il a été victime d'agression de la part d'autres individus à son séminaire et qu'on l'a persécuté parce que des membres de l'église avaient appris qu'il était bisexuel.\n[5]\nLe demandeur déclare que l'une de ses surs s'est suicidée en novembre 2004 et qu'il craignait que son père le tue parce qu'il était le seul qui savait que sa sur s'était enlevée la vie à cause des sévices que son père lui faisait subir.\n[6]\nLe demandeur s'est rendu en République dominicaine en 2007 et a demandé à des prêtres de l'aider à fuir aux États-Unis. Il dit être retourné au Mexique en vue d'obtenir un visa des É.-U. en mars 2007, mais ce visa a été refusé. Finalement, un prêtre au Texas a offert de payer le voyage en avion du demandeur jusqu'au Canada, où celui-ci est arrivé le 25 juillet 2008. Il s'est joint à une église au Canada mais, après une évaluation psychologique, cette église ne l'a pas admis. N'ayant nulle part où aller, et craignant de retourner au Mexique, le demandeur a présenté sa demande d'asile le 12 août 2009.\n[7]\nLe demandeur a été arrêté le 26 février 2011 et accusé d'avoir attiré un enfant, d'avoir eu des contacts sexuels et d'avoir commis une agression sexuelle. Au moment de l'audience, les accusations étaient encore en instance. Le ministre de la Sécurité publique et de la Protection civile a pris part à l'audience relative à la demande d'asile.\nLa décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle\n[8]\nLa Commission a conclu que la demande du demandeur était dénuée d'un minimum de fondement. Elle a rejeté la prétention selon laquelle le demandeur avait été agressé par son père et menacé par une personne quelconque au Mexique, ou que, dans ce dernier pays, on cherchait à lui faire du mal.\n[9]\nLa Commission a relevé de nombreuses incohérences dans le témoignage du demandeur, dont les suivantes:\na. sa déclaration selon laquelle son père l'avait agressé sexuellement a été contredite par ce qu'il avait déclaré à un psychologue ecclésiastique en septembre 2007, à savoir qu'un voisin l'avait agressé sexuellement; la Commission a de plus rejeté l'explication selon laquelle le demandeur avait menti parce que l'église ne l'aurait pas admis s'il était homosexuel, vu que le même rapport faisait état de son attirance envers d'autres hommes;\nb. la Commission a rejeté les prétentions selon lesquelles le père du demandeur était fortuné et puissant, car il était manuvre et circulait en autobus; le demandeur n'a pas pu expliquer pourquoi son père ne se servait pas de sa propre automobile et de son chauffeur; la Commission a également signalé que la fuite présumée du père, après que les voisins l'avaient vu agresser le demandeur, ne cadrait pas avec le fait que le père était fortuné et puissant;\nc. la Commission a conclu que le demandeur avait témoigné de manière confuse et incohérente à propos de la présumée implication de son père dans le trafic de la drogue;\nd. la Commission n'a relevé aucune preuve que le père du demandeur avait forcé ou tenté de forcer son fils à revenir à la maison pendant la période de près de 20 ans qui avait suivi son départ de la maison, à l'âge de 19 ans;\ne. la Commission a conclu que la preuve documentaire n'étayait pas l'allégation du demandeur selon laquelle son père avait agressé sexuellement sa sur; les accusations portées contre le père par le demandeur pour le compte de sa sur décédée ont été rejetées faute de preuve; la Commission a également fait remarquer que la note de suicide ne faisait pas état d'agressions sexuelles;\nf. la Commission a conclu que le fait que le demandeur n'avait jamais porté d'accusations en son nom contre son père étayait sa conclusion selon laquelle il n'avait jamais été agressé;\ng. le demandeur avait fourni des preuves contradictoires au sujet de la date de l'incident à l'occasion duquel toute la famille avait été emmenée au poste de police;\nh. la Commission a conclu que le demandeur avait essayé d'enjoliver sa demande en soulevant à l'audience de nouvelles allégations qui ne figuraient pas dans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP);\ni. la Commission a conclu que le fait que le père avait payé la totalité des études du demandeur ne cadrait pas avec l'affirmation de ce dernier selon laquelle son père le détestait; interrogé sur ce point, le demandeur a formulé une fois de plus une nouvelle allégation: son père voulait qu'il apprenne comment fonctionne le milieu de la drogue; la Commission a conclu que cela était invraisemblable.\n[10]\nLa Commission a également tiré des conclusions défavorables quant à la crédibilité du fait que le demandeur n'avait pas sollicité une protection en République dominicaine, qu'il ne s'était pas réclamé à nouveau de la protection du Mexique en 2007 et qu'il avait tardé à demander l'asile au Canada.\n[11]\nPour ce qui est du fait que le demandeur craignait la société mexicaine parce qu'il était bisexuel, la Commission a conclu que les mesures prises par lui au Canada n'étayaient pas la prétention selon laquelle il craignait de retourner au Mexique. Elle a fait remarquer que le demandeur s'était censément livré à des actes sexuels avec un mineur en public, des actes pour lesquels il était sous le coup d'accusations criminelles. Elle a déclaré qu'il ne lui appartenait pas d'examiner les faits relatifs à ces accusations ou de tirer une conclusion de culpabilité.\n[12]\nLa Commission a conclu que la demande du demandeur était dénuée d'un minimum de fondement, au sens du paragraphe 107(2) de la LIPR. La demande a donc été rejetée.\nLa question en litige\n[13]\nLe demandeur soulève les questions suivantes:\na. la conclusion que la Commission a tirée au sujet d'un minimum de fondement était-elle raisonnable?\nb. la conclusion que la Commission a tirée au sujet de la crédibilité était-elle raisonnable?\nc. la conclusion que la Commission a tirée au sujet de la crainte subjective était-elle raisonnable?\n[14]\nComme il y a lieu d'infirmer la décision sur le fondement de la première question soulevée, il n'est nul besoin que la Cour traite des autres.\nAnalyse\n[15]\nLe demandeur prétend que la Commission ne peut conclure à l'absence d'un minimum de fondement que s'il n'y a aucun élément de preuve crédible ou digne de foi susceptible d'étayer la demande; une conclusion d'absence de crédibilité du demandeur ne suffit pas:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Il soutient qu'étant donné que la Commission a admis qu'il était bisexuel, il était erroné de sa part de ne pas prendre en considération la preuve documentaire portant sur la persécution des minorités sexuelles; il s'agissait là d'une preuve crédible qui était susceptible d'étayer la demande:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[16]\nDans son mémoire additionnel, le défendeur a laissé tomber ses arguments de fond sur la conclusion d' absence d'un minimum de fondement  et il a soutenu que la Commission n'a pas tiré de conclusion en vertu du paragraphe 107(2). Cela est manifestement erroné; la Commission indique, au paragraphe 75:\nSelon le paragraphe 107(2) de la LIPR, je dois conclure à l'absence d'un minimum de fondement de la demande d'asile. Puisque j'estime que la Commission ne dispose d'aucun élément de preuve crédible ou digne de foi lui permettant de déterminer que le demandeur d'asile a qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ou celle de personne à protéger, la demande d'asile est rejetée.\n[17]\nJe conviens avec le demandeur que la conclusion d' absence d'un minimum de fondement  est déraisonnable et, pour cette raison, je me dois d'infirmer la décision de la Commission. Celle-ci a conclu que le demandeur n'était pas digne de foi en rapport avec ses allégations concernant son père, mais elle a quand même admis qu'il était bisexuel. Le demandeur a dit s'exposer à des risques du fait de sa bisexualité et a présenté une abondante preuve documentaire sur les risques que courent les minorités sexuelles au Mexique. Compte tenu de cette preuve, la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle la demande d'asile n'avait pas un minimum de fondement était déraisonnable.\n[18]\nPour conclure à l'absence d'un minimum de fondement d'une demande d'asile, le seuil à franchir est élevé, ainsi qu'il est indiqué dans l'arrêt <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 51:\n[...] Comme j'ai tenté de le démontrer, la Commission doit, suivant le paragraphe 69.1(9.1), examiner tous les éléments de preuve qui lui sont présentés et conclure à l'absence d'un minimum de fondement seulement s'il n'y a aucun élément de preuve crédible ou digne de foi sur lequel elle aurait pu se fonder pour reconnaître le statut de réfugié au revendicateur.\n[19]\nC'est donc dire que s'il existe un élément de preuve crédible ou digne de foi\nquelconque\nqui est susceptible d'étayer une reconnaissance positive, il n'est pas loisible à la Commission de conclure que la demande d'asile est dénuée d'un minimum de fondement, même si, au bout du compte, elle conclut que cette demande n'a pas été établie selon la prépondérance des probabilités.\n[20]\nComme le soutient le demandeur, la présente affaire est semblable à l'affaire\nSingh\n, précitée. Dans cette dernière, même si la Commission avait rejeté le témoignage du demandeur au sujet des tortures qu'il avait subies et avait conclu qu'il n'était pas digne de foi, elle n'avait pas mis en doute le fait qu'il était un sikh baptisé. Comme la Commission avait en main une preuve documentaire indiquant que les sikhs baptisés couraient le risque d'être persécutés en Inde, la Cour a jugé qu'il était erroné de conclure que la demande d'asile était dénuée d'un minimum de fondement sans tenir compte de cette preuve. Voici ce qu'a déclaré le juge Edmond Blanchard, au paragraphe 26:\nAinsi, dans la mesure où il y avait de la preuve non contredite au dossier établissant que le demandeur était un prêtre sikh et où la preuve documentaire établit que les sikhs baptisés sont un groupe risque de persécution en Inde, la Commission ne pouvait valablement conclure à l'absence d'un minimum de fondement de la demande d'asile du demandeur.\n[21]\nDans le même ordre d'idées, en l'espèce, après avoir admis que le demandeur était bisexuel et avoir été saisi d'une abondante preuve documentaire sur la persécution des minorités sexuelles au Mexique, il était déraisonnable de la part de la Commission de conclure que la demande d'asile du demandeur était dénuée d'un minimum de fondement.\n[22]\nLe défendeur soutient (dans son mémoire initial) que la preuve documentaire ne peut étayer la demande d'asile du demandeur parce que cette preuve, à elle seule, n'étaye pas la conclusion que, selon toute vraisemblance, le demandeur s'expose à des risques au sens de l'article 97. Cependant, cette conclusion est contraire au raisonnement formulé dans\nSingh\net elle confond le critère énoncé au paragraphe 107(2) avec celui qui est énoncé à l'article 97: il était peut-être raisonnablement loisible à la Commission de conclure, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que le demandeur ne s'exposait pas à des risques du fait de sa bisexualité, mais cela ne veut pas dire qu'elle pouvait tirer une conclusion d' absence d'un minimum de fondement  au vu de la preuve documentaire crédible et digne de confiance selon laquelle les personnes se trouvant dans la situation du demandeur s'exposent à des risques. En raison de la présence de cette preuve (et de la conclusion selon laquelle le demandeur était bisexuel, ce qui le reliait donc aux risques allégués), la Commission était tenue de soupeser la preuve et de décider si la demande d'asile avait été établie.\n[23]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie.\nJUGEMENT\n[24]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire soit accueillie. L'affaire est renvoyée à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié en vue d'être réexaminée par un commissaire différent de la Section de la protection des réfugiés. Aucune question à certifier n'a été proposée, et la Cour conclut qu'il ne s'en pose aucune.\n[End of document]",

Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2012] F.T.R. TBEd. AP.003.\n\n[1]\nRennie, J.\n: The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board), dated June 14, 2011, which held that the applicant was not a Convention (United Nations'\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] Can TS No 6) refugee or person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (\nIRPA\n). For the reasons that follow, the application is granted.\nFacts\n\n[2]\nThe applicant is a citizen of Mexico. He alleges fear of persecution by his father, who allegedly physically and sexually abused him throughout his life, and continued to harass him as an adult, tracking him down wherever he went. The applicant also alleges fear of persecution in Mexico because he is bisexual.\n\n[3]\nThe applicant alleges that his father began abusing him at a young age and also allowed his friends to abuse him. The applicant states that he was afraid to report his father because he was powerful and involved in drug trafficking. The applicant alleges that his father once cut off part of his finger threatening him never to report the abuse. The applicant states his father was also abusive to his mother and sisters.\n\n[4]\nThe applicant alleges that once he left home to study to become a priest, his father would pursue him wherever he went and harass and threaten him. He also alleges that he was assaulted by other individuals at his seminary and was persecuted because members of the church learned of his bisexuality.\n\n[5]\nThe applicant states that one of his sisters committed suicide in November 2004 and the applicant feared his father would kill him because he was the only one who knew that she killed herself because of their father's abuse.\n\n[6]\nThe applicant traveled to the Dominican Republic in 2007 seeking help from priests to flee to the United States (U.S.). He states that he returned to Mexico to obtain a U.S. visa in March 2007 but the visa was refused. Eventually, a priest in Texas offered to pay the applicant's airfare to Canada where the applicant arrived on July 25, 2008. He entered a church in Canada but after a psychological assessment the church did not accept him. Having nowhere to go, and fearing return to Mexico, the applicant made his refugee claim on August 12, 2009.\n\n[7]\nThe applicant was arrested on February 26, 2011 and charged with luring a child, sexual interference and sexual assault. The charges were still pending at the time of the hearing. The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness participated in the refugee hearing.\nDecision Under Review\n\n[8]\nThe Board found that there was no credible basis for the applicant's claim. The Board rejected that the applicant had been assaulted by his father, threatened by anyone in Mexico or that anyone in Mexico was looking to harm the applicant.\n\n[9]\nThe Board noted many inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence, including:\na. His statement that his father sexually abused him was contradicted by his statements to a church psychologist in September 2007 that a neighbour had sexually abused him. The Board further rejected the explanation that the applicant lied because the church would not accept him if he were homosexual, since that same report referred to his attraction to other men.\nb. The Board rejected the claims that the applicant's father was wealthy and powerful, since he was a general labourer and traveled by bus. The applicant could not explain why he did not use his own car and driver. The Board also noted that the father's alleged flight after the neighbours witnessed him abuse the applicant was inconsistent with the father being wealthy and powerful.\nc. The Board found that the applicant gave confusing and inconsistent testimony about his father's alleged involvement in drug trafficking.\nd. The Board found no evidence the applicant's father forced or tried to force the applicant to return home for the nearly two decades after he left home at the age of 19.\ne. The Board found the documentary evidence did not support the applicant's allegation that his father was sexually abusing his sister. The charges against his father, instituted by him on his deceased sister's behalf, were dismissed due to lack of evidence. The Board also noted that the suicide note made no mention of sexual abuse.\nf. The Board found that the applicant's failure to ever pursue charges on his own behalf against his father supported its conclusion he was never abused.\ng. The applicant had given conflicting evidence regarding the date of the incident when the whole family was brought to the police station.\nh. The Board found the applicant tried to embellish his claim by raising new allegations at the hearing that were not in his Personal Information Form (PIF).\ni. The Board found that the applicant's father paying for all his studies was inconsistent with the applicant's assertion that his father hated him. When asked about this, the applicant again advanced a new allegation; that his father wanted him to learn the narcotics business. The Board found this implausible.\n\n[10]\nThe Board also drew negative credibility findings from the applicant's failure to seek protection in the Dominican Republic, his re-availment to Mexico in 2007 and his delay in claiming protection in Canada.\n\n[11]\nRegarding the applicant's fear of Mexican society due to his bisexuality, the Board found that the applicant's actions in Canada did not support a claim of fear of returning to Mexico. The Board noted that he had allegedly engaged in sexual acts with a minor in public, for which he was subject to criminal charges. The Board stated it was not its place to examine the facts of those charges or make a finding of guilt.\n\n[12]\nThe Board concluded that there was no credible basis for the applicant's claim, pursuant to section 107(2) of the\nIRPA\n. The claim was therefore rejected.\nIssue\n\n[13]\nThe applicant presents the following issues:\na. Was the Board's no credible basis finding reasonable?\nb. Was the Board's credibility finding reasonable?\nc. Was the Board's subjective fear finding reasonable?\n\n[14]\nBecause the decision must be set aside on the basis of the first issue the Court need not address the other issues.\nAnalysis\n\n[15]\nThe applicant submits that the Board can only make a no credible basis finding if there is no trustworthy or credible evidence that could support the claim, a finding that the applicant is not credible is insufficient:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The applicant submits that since the Board accepted that he was bisexual it was an error not to consider the documentary evidence of persecution of sexual minorities, this was credible evidence that could support the claim:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[16]\nIn the respondent's Further Memorandum, it abandoned its substantive arguments about the \"no credible basis\" finding and submitted that the Board did not make a finding pursuant to section 107(2). This is clearly wrong; the Board states at paragraph 75:\nIn accordance with section 107(2) of the\nIRPA\nI am required to state that there is no credible basis for this claim. As I find there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Board could have determined the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the claim is rejected.\n\n[17]\nI agree with the applicant that the \"no credible basis\" finding was unreasonable and for that reason the Board's decision must be set aside. While the Board found the applicant not to be credible in relation to his allegations about his father, the Board did accept that he was bisexual. The applicant alleged risk on the ground of his bisexuality and presented extensive documentary evidence on the risk faced by sexual minorities in Mexico. In light of this evidence the Board's conclusion that there was no credible basis for the claim was unreasonable.\n\n[18]\nThe threshold for a finding that there is no credible basis for the claim is a high one, as set out in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 51:\n... As I have attempted to demonstrate, subs. 69.1(9.1) requires the Board to examine all the evidence and to conclude that the claim has no credible basis only when there is no trustworthy or credible evidence that could support a recognition of the claim.\n\n[19]\nThus, if there is\nany\ncredible or trustworthy evidence that could support a positive determination the Board cannot find there is no credible basis for the claim, even if, ultimately, the Board finds that the claim has not been established on a balance of probabilities.\n\n[20]\nAs the applicant submits, this case is similar to\nSingh\n, above. In that case, while the Board rejected the applicant's testimony about being tortured and found him not to be credible, the Board did not question the applicant's status as a baptized Sikh. Since there was documentary evidence before the Board that baptized Sikhs were at risk of persecution in India, the Court found it was an error to conclude there was no credible basis for the claim without consideration of that evidence. Justice Edmond Blanchard stated at paragraph 26:\nAccordingly, since there was uncontradicted evidence in the file establishing that the applicant was a Sikh priest and where the documentary evidence showed that baptized Sikhs are a group at risk of persecution in India, the Board could not properly find that the applicant's refugee claim had no credible basis.\n\n[21]\nSimilarly in this case, having accepted that the applicant is bisexual, and faced with extensive documentary evidence of persecution of sexual minorities in Mexico, it was unreasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicant's claim had no credible basis.\n\n[22]\nThe respondent argues (in its initial Memorandum) that the documentary evidence is not capable of supporting the applicant's claim because it alone does not support a finding that it is more likely than not that the applicant faces a risk under section 97. However, this submission is at odds with the reasoning in\nSingh\nand conflates the standard under section 107(2) with the standard under section 97: while it may have been reasonably open to the Board to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the applicant would not be at risk because of his bisexuality, that does not mean that it could make a \"no credible basis\" finding in light of credible and trustworthy documentary evidence that persons in the applicant's circumstances are at risk. Because of the presence of this evidence (and the Board's finding that the applicant was bisexual, thus linking him to the alleged risk), the Board was required to weigh the evidence and determine if the claim had been established.\n\n[23]\nThe application for judicial review is granted.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[24]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted. The matter is referred back to the Immigration Refugee Board for reconsideration before a different member of the Board's Refugee Protection Division. No question for certification has been proposed and the Court finds that none arises.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant seeks judicial review of a decision dated June 14, 2011 by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) concluded that he did not have refugee status (\nUnited Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees\n, [1969] RT Can no 6) nor that of person to be protected, within the meaning of articles 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, LC 2001, c 27 (IRPA).

    "court_analysis": [
      "The Court found the Refugee Protection Division’s (the Board) “no credible basis” determination to be unreasonable and set aside the decision, requiring reconsideration by a different Board member.",
      "The Court clarified that a “no credible basis” finding under section 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) requires a high threshold: the Board must find *no* trustworthy or credible evidence that *could* support the claim, not simply that the claim hasn't been proven on a balance of probabilities.",
      "The Court distinguished between the standard for a “no credible basis” finding (section 107(2)) and the standard for determining refugee status (section 97), emphasizing that even if the Board doubted the applicant would *likely* face persecution, it could not dismiss the claim entirely if credible evidence existed suggesting a risk to individuals in similar circumstances.",
      "The Court relied on the precedent in *Singh* where the Board erred by failing to consider documentary evidence of risk to a specific group (Sikhs) despite disbelieving the applicant’s personal testimony; similarly, here, the Board accepted the applicant was bisexual but failed to adequately consider the extensive documentary evidence of persecution faced by sexual minorities in Mexico.",
      "Because the Board accepted the applicant’s claim of being bisexual and documentary evidence demonstrated persecution of bisexual individuals in Mexico, the Court reasoned that the Board was obligated to weigh the evidence and determine if the claim was established, rather than dismissing it as having 'no credible basis'.",
      "The Court rejected the respondent’s argument that the documentary evidence was insufficient to establish a likelihood of persecution, stating that this argument conflated the standards under sections 107(2) and 97 of the IRPA."
