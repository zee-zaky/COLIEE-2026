    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC 808)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  J.\nJune 4, 2004.\nCounsel:\nJean-François Fiset, for the plaintiff;\nMario Blanchard, for the defendant.\nSolicitors of Record:\nJean-François Fiset, Montreal, Quebec, for the plaintiff;\nMorris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Montreal, Quebec, for the defendant.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2004] F.T.R. TBEd. JN.019. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nRouleau, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated November 3, 2003, that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant, a 28-year-old citizen of Pakistan, alleges that he qualifies as a person in need of protection because he fears persecution by the police and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) by reason of his political beliefs and his affiliations with the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).",
    "[3]\nIn his Personal Information Form (PIF) and his testimony before the Board, the applicant alleged that his problems with the Pakistani authorities began in 1991 and persisted until his departure from Pakistan on October 28, 2000, to go to the United States where he claimed refugee status. He was incarcerated at first and later released when it was determined that his claim had a minimum of merit. While awaiting his hearing on the merits, the applicant lived and worked in the United States, but, fearing that the commencement of the \"Registration of Aliens\" program, created in the United States following the events of September 11, 2001, would jeopardize his chances of success in his asylum process, the applicant left the United States to come to Canada on March 23, 2003, and applied for refugee status while his case was pending in the United States.",
    "[4]\nThe Board's reasons indicate that it relied on numerous inconsistencies in the applicant's story in order to find that he lacked credibility and that his claim for asylum was completely without merit.",
    "[5]\nMore specifically, the Board noted that the applicant's testimony was interspersed with lengthy moments of hesitation, while he limited himself to repeating his PIF word for word and was unable to provide any particulars beyond the content of the PIF.",
    "[6]\nTo corroborate his claims of affiliation with the PPP, the applicant filed in evidence at the hearing four letters from PPP officials based in Pakistan and New York. However, it was disclosed at the hearing that the applicant did not personally know most of them or had ever met them. Moreover, after examining closely one of the letters filed in evidence by the applicant (a letter from the PPP president in New York), the Board noted that it had been manually falsified.",
    "[7]\nConcerning the probative value to be given to the three other letters, the Board noted that they were not contemporaneous with the events that supposedly occurred, that they had been constituted at the personal request of the applicant's father, not the applicant, and that consequently they were not first-hand evidence since they had been written pursuant to hearsay by the applicant's father.",
    "[8]\nIn his PIF, the applicant alleged that an arrest warrant was issued against him on October 18, 1999. However, the applicant was unable to tell the hearing at what date the warrant had been issued against him. Moreover, the Board noted that the applicant had failed to file this arrest warrant in evidence at the hearing, although he had filed a First Information Report (FIR). The Board was puzzled that the applicant was unable to explain the difference between a FIR and a warrant of arrest in Pakistan.",
    "[9]\nThe applicant justified his failure to file his arrest warrant in evidence by the fact that he had still not received it. When confronted with the inconsistency resulting from the latter statement, the applicant adjusted his testimony and stated that he was no longer really certain that a warrant had indeed been filed against him and that perhaps there was none. Yet the Board noted that earlier in the hearing the applicant had been adamant in his reply when asked whether a warrant had been issued against him, answering \"obviously there is one because the police comes to my house once a month to arrest me.\"",
    "[10]\nFurthermore, the Board found that the allegations of harassment and persecution at the hands of the Pakistani police since 1999 were contradicted by the documentary evidence, which reports that it is high profile members who are targeted. So the Board thought it improbable that the police would issue a FIR against the applicant in 1999 when, by his own account, he had ceased his political activities in 1994.",
    "[11]\nFinally, the Board reports in its reasons that the applicant's conduct - the fact that he had renewed his Pakistani passport at New York, on September 26, 2001 - was incompatible with that of a refugee. Citing articles 41 and 49 of the UN's Handbook on Procedures and Criteria, the Board held that this conduct denied the existence of a subjective fear in Pakistan.",
    "[12]\nAll of these reasons led the Board to reject the applicant's claim.",
    "[13]\nThe applicant's main argument is the claim that the Board erred in dwelling solely on an analysis of the applicant's circumstances from the standpoint of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), and then using this analysis to reject the applicant's claim under section 97 of the Act. The applicant submits that this approach is erroneous because it contradicts the intention of Parliament by making these two sections into one and stripping section 97 of its content and rationale.",
    "[14]\nIn support of this submission, the applicant refers to the decision of this Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Mr. Justice Blanchard stated:\n 41 A claim under section 97 must be evaluated with respect to all the relevant considerations and with a view to the country's human rights record. While the Board must assess the applicant's claim objectively, the analysis must still be individualized. I am satisfied that this interpretation is not only consistent with the United Nations CAT decisions considered above, but is also supported by the wording of paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Act, which refers to persons, \"... whose removal ... would subject them personally ...\". There may well be instances where a refugee claimant, whose identity is not disputed, is found to be not credible with respect to his subjective fear of persecution, but the country conditions are such that the claimant's particular circumstances, make him/her a person in need of protection. It follows that a negative credibility determination, which may be determinative of a refugee claim under s. 96 of the Act, is not necessarily determinative of a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act. The elements required to establish a claim under section 97 differ from those required under section 96 of the Act where a well-founded fear of persecution to a convention ground must be established.",
    "[15]\nThus, the applicant argues, the Board erred in using its findings on lack of credibility to dismiss the applicant's fear of persecution. The Board, he submits, should not have confined itself to saying the applicant was not credible without considering the documentary evidence establishing systematic violations of human rights committed in Pakistan.",
    "[16]\nThe applicant further alleges that the Board's decision was unfair and arbitrary since it failed to consider a number of items of evidence, as well as a significant portion of his testimony. Furthermore, he says, the Board adopted contradictory and irreconcilable positions concerning his credibility.",
    "[17]\nThe applicant also argues that the Board erred in requiring a more demanding burden of proof than the one required by the Act, and that this necessitates the intervention of this Court.",
    "[18]\nFinally, he alleges that the Board erred in applying Canadian standards in its assessment of his conduct without taking cultural differences into account.",
    "[19]\nThe respondent notes that the reasons for rejecting the claim largely pertain to inconsistencies in the applicant's testimony at the hearing, and argues that the deficiencies in question, indicated by the Board, cannot attract the intervention of this Court.",
    "[20]\nThe respondent further submits that the applicant, in attempting to cite an inconsistency in the Board's decision, presents at several places in his memorandum conclusions drawn by the Board that are in fact simply allegations by the applicant that were repeated by the Board.",
    "[21]\nFirst of all, I wish to point out that the relevant test under section 96 is in fact quite distinct from the test under section 97. A claim based on section 97 requires the Board to apply a different criterion pertaining to the issue of whether the applicant's removal may or may not expose him personally to the risks and dangers referred to in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. However, this criterion must be assessed in light of the personal characteristics of the applicant. Indeed, as Blanchard J. noted in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n 41 [T]he wording of paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Act ... refers to persons, \"... whose removal ... would subject them personally ...\". There may well be instances where a refugee claimant, whose identity is not disputed, is found to be not credible with respect to his subjective fear of persecution, but the country conditions are such that the claimant's particular circumstances, make him/her a person in need of protection. [Emphasis added]",
    "[22]\nThus the assessment of the applicant's fear must be made in concreto, and not from an abstract and general perspective. The fact that the documentary evidence illustrates unequivocally the systematic and generalized violation of human rights in Pakistan is simply not sufficient to establish the specific and individualized fear of persecution of the applicant in particular. Absent the least proof that might link the general documentary evidence to the applicant's specific circumstances, I conclude that the Board did not err in the way it analyzed the applicant's claim under section 97.",
    "[23]\nHaving analyzed the case as a whole, and in light of the very strongly argued decision of the Board, I am unable likewise to adopt the other submissions of the applicant. This is a case of judicial review of a decision almost entirely based on the assessment of the applicant's credibility in terms of his testimony before the Board. It has been consistently held by our courts that the Board has well established expertise when it comes to determining questions of fact and in particular assessing the credibility of asylum seekers. In fact, the assessment of the facts constitutes the cornerstone of the Board's jurisdiction. As the trier of facts, the Board is the body that is in the best position to draw reasonable findings as to the credibility of the claimant's story, basing itself on improbability, common sense and reason. Consequently, if the Court is to set aside a finding of fact by the Board it must be demonstrated that this finding is patently unreasonable, and that has not been done in this case.",
    "[24]\nIn fact, the applicant appears to detect in the Board's reasons an inconsistency that does not exist. And since the applicant was not considered credible, the Board was entitled not to assign probative value to the personal exhibits the applicant filed in support of his refugee claim.",
    "[25]\nFinally, it should be noted that even if the applicant's claim for asylum had been considered sufficiently credible by the U.S. authorities to result in his release, that claim was not decided on the merits by the U.S. authorities and the applicant cannot rely on this release alone to demonstrate the merit of his refugee claim. Furthermore, even if the applicant had been awarded refugee status in the United States, that does not imply that he could automatically obtain asylum in Canada, since the Canadian and U.S. systems for recognizing refugee status are distinct and independent.",
    "[26]\nThe onus of demonstrating that the Board erred in its assessment of the evidence rested on the applicant, and in the absence of any such demonstration I do not see how the intervention of this Court could be warranted in this case.",
    "[27]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.\n....................\nHasib Ahmad (plaintiff) v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (defendant)"

Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration (partie défenderesse)\n[1]\nLe juge Rouleau\n: Il s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire d'une décision de la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la \"Commission\") rendue le 3 novembre 2003, selon laquelle le demandeur n'est pas un réfugié au sens de la Convention, ni une personne à protéger.\n[2]\nLe demandeur, un citoyen du Pakistan âgé de 28 ans, allègue qu'il a la qualité de personne à protéger car il craint la persécution par la police ainsi que par la Pakistan Muslim League (PML) en raison de ses croyances politiques et de ses affiliations au Pakistan People's Party (PPP).\n[3]\nDans son formulaire de renseignements personnels (FRP) ainsi que dans son témoignage devant la Commission, le demandeur a allégué que ses problèmes avec les autorités pakistanaises ont débuté en 1991 et ont persisté jusqu'à son départ du Pakistan, le 28 octobre 2000, en direction des États-Unis où il a revendiqué le statut de réfugié. Il a d'abord été incarcéré et par la suite libéré lorsqu'on a détérminé que sa revendication avait un minimum de mérite. En attendant son audition sur le fond, le demandeur a vécu et a travaillé aux États-Unis, mais, craignant que la mise en marche du programme de \"Registration of Aliens\" créé aux États-Unis suite aux événements du 11 septembre 2001 allait mettre en péril ses chance de succès dans son processus d'asile, le demandeur a quitté les États-unis en direction du Canada le 23 mars 2003 et y a demandé le statut de réfugié alors que sa cause était pendante aux États-Unis.\n[4]\nLes motifs de la Commission révèlent que cette dernière s'est fondée sur de nombreuses incohérences dans le récit du demandeur afin de conclure à l'absence de crédibilité du demandeur et que sa demande d'asile était dénuée de toute mérite.\n[5]\nPlus précisément, la Commission a noté que le témoignage du demandeur a été entrecoupé de longs moments d'hésitation, alors qu'il s'est restreint à répéter mot pour mot son FRP étant incapable de donner des détails au-delà du contenu du FRP.\n[6]\nAfin de corroborer ses prétentions d'affiliation au PPP, le demandeur a déposé en preuve, à l'audience, quatre lettres d'officiels du PPP basés au Pakistan et à New York. Cependant, il fut révélé lors de l'audience que le demandeur ne connaissait pas personnellement la majorité d'entre eux, ne les ayant jamais rencontrés. De plus, après avoir étudié attentivement une des lettres déposées en preuve par le demandeur (lettre du président du PPP à New York), la Commission a remarqué qu'elle avait été manuellement falsifiée.\n[7]\nConcernant la valeur probante accordée aux trois autres lettres, la Commission a noté que celles-ci n'étaient pas contemporaines aux événements soi-disant survenus, qu'elles avaient été constituées, non pas à la demande personnelle du demandeur mais de son père et que, par conséquent, elles n'étaient pas des preuves de première main puisqu'elles avaient été rédigées suite aux ouï-dire du père du demandeur.\n[8]\nDans son FRP, le demandeur a allégué qu'un mandat d'arrêt fut émis contre lui le 18 octobre 1999. Cependant, le demandeur n'a pas été en mesure de dire, à l'audience, à quelle date le mandat avait été émis contre lui. De plus, la Commission a souligné que le demandeur n'a pas réussi à déposer en preuve à l'audience ce mandat d'arrêt; alors pourtant qu'il a déposé un First Information Report (FIR). La Commission a trouvé curieux que le demandeur ne soit pas en mesure d'expliquer la différence existant entre une FIR et un mandat d'arrêt au Pakistan.\n[9]\nLe demandeur a justifié son défaut de déposer en preuve son mandat d'arrêt par le fait qu'il ne l'avait toujours pas reçu. Lorsque confronté avec l'incohérence résultant de cette dernière déclaration, le demandeur a ajusté son témoignage pour déclarer qu'il n'était plus réellement certain qu'un mandat avait bel et bien été déposé contre lui et que peut être n'y en avait-il pas eu. Pourtant la Commission a noté que, plutôt à l'audience, le demandeur avait été catégorique dans sa réponse à la question de savoir si un mandat avait été émis contre lui en répondant par \"obviously there is one because the police comes to my house once a month to arrest me\".\n[10]\nDe plus, la Commission a constaté que les allégations de harcèlement et de persécution aux mains de la police pakistanaise depuis 1999 sont contredites par la preuve documentaire; alors que cette dernière rapporte que ce sont les militants de haut calibre qui sont visés. Ainsi, la Commission n'a pas jugé vraisemblable que la police émette, contre le demandeur, un FIR en 1999; alors que selon ses dires mêmes, il a cessé ses activités politiques depuis 1994.\n[11]\nEnfin, la Commission rapporte dans ses motifs que le comportement du demandeur fut incompatible avec celui d'un réfugié, soit le fait que le demandeur a fait renouveler à New York, le 26 septembre 2001, son passeport pakistanais. En se basant sur les articles 41 et 49 du Guide des procédures et critères de l'ONU, la Commission a jugé que ce comportement niait l'existence d'une crainte subjective au Pakistan.\n[12]\nTous ces motifs ont amené la Commission à rejeter la demande du demandeur.\n[13]\nL'argument principal du demandeur consiste dans la prétention selon laquelle la Commission a erré en ne s'attardant uniquement sur une analyse de la situation du demandeur sous l'angle de l'article 96 de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, ch. 27, \"la Loi\", pour ensuite utiliser cette même analyse pour écarter la revendication du demandeur sous l'article 97 de la Loi. Or, le demandeur prétend que cette approche est erronée car elle va à l'encontre de l'intention du législateur, en faisant de ces deux articles un seul et dépouillant l'article 97 de son contenu et de sa raison d'être.\n[14]\nPour soutenir cette prétention, le demandeur se réfère à la décision de cette Cour dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dans laquelle le juge Blanchard énonçait:\n 41 Une revendication fondée sur l'article 97 doit être appréciée en tenant compte de toutes les considérations pertinentes ainsi que du comportement en matière de droits de la personne du pays concerné. Bien que la Commission doive évaluer objectivement la revendication du demandeur, il lui faut individualiser son analyse. J'estime cette interprétation conforme non seulement aux décisions du CCT des Nations Unies examinées précédemment, mais aussi au libellé même de l'alinéa 97(1)a) de la Loi, qui fait mention d'une personne qui \"serait personnellement, par son renvoi [...] exposée [...]\". Il peut y avoir des cas où l'on conclut qu'un revendicateur du statut de réfugié, dont l'identité n'est pas contestée, n'est pas crédible pour ce qui est de la crainte subjective d'être persécuté, mais où les conditions dans le pays sont telles que la situation individuelle du revendicateur fait de lui une personne à protéger. Il s'ensuit qu'une conclusion défavorable en matière de crédibilité, quoique pouvant être déterminante quant à une revendication du statut de réfugié en vertu de l'article 96 de la Loi, ne le sera pas nécessairement quant à une revendication en vertu du paragraphe 97(1). Les éléments requis pour établir le bien-fondé d'une revendication aux termes de l'article 97 diffèrent de ceux requis en regard de l'article 96, la crainte fondée de persécution pour un motif visé à la Convention devant être démontrée dans ce dernier cas.\n[15]\nAinsi le demandeur est d'avis que la Commission a erré en se servant de ses conclusions sur l'absence de crédibilité pour écarter la crainte de persécution chez le demandeur. En effet, le demandeur soumet que la Commission n'aurait pas dû se limiter à dire que le demandeur n'est pas crédible sans considérer la preuve documentaire établissant des violations systématiques des droits de l'homme commises au Pakistan.\n[16]\nPar ailleurs, le demandeur allègue que la Commission a rendu une décision inéquitable et arbitraire puisqu'elle n'a pas considéré plusieurs éléments de preuves, de même qu'une partie importante de son témoignage. De plus, le demandeur est d'avis que la Commission a adopté des positions inconciliables et contradictoires sur sa crédibilité.\n[17]\nDe plus, le demandeur soumet que la Commission a erré en exigeant un fardeau de preuve plus exigeant que celui prévu par la Loi, ce qui nécessiterait l'intervention de cette Cour.\n[18]\nEnfin, le demandeur allègue que la Commission a erré en appliquant des standards canadiens afin d'évaluer son comportement sans tenir compte des différences culturelles.\n[19]\nLe défendeur constate qu'en grande partie les raisons menant au rejet de la demande relèvent des incohérences dans le témoignage du demandeur à l'audience et soumet que les défaillances en question, décelées par la Commission, ne peuvent entraîner une intervention de cette Cour.\n[20]\nDe plus, le défendeur soumet qu'afin d'invoquer une incohérence dans la décision de la Commission, à plusieurs endroits dans son mémoire le demandeur présente comme des conclusions tirées par la Commission qui ne sont, en fait, que les allégations du demandeur reprises par la Commission.\n[21]\nTout d'abord, je tiens à souligner que le test pertinent en vertu de l'article 96 est effectivement bien distinct de celui en vertu de l'article 97. En effet, une revendication fondée sur l'article 97 appelle l'application par la Commission d'un critère différent, ayant trait à la question de savoir si le renvoi du revendicateur peut ou non l'exposer personnellement aux risques et menaces mentionnés aux alinéas 97(1)a) et b) de la Loi. Cependant, ce critère doit s'apprécier en tenant compte des caractéristiques personnelles du défendeur. En effet, comme l'a souligné le juge Blanchard dans la décision Bouaouni, précitée:\n 41 [le] libellé même de l'alinéa 97(1)a) de la Loi, qui fait mention d'une personne qui \"serait personnellement, par son renvoi [...] exposée [...]\". Il peut y avoir des cas où l'on conclut qu'un revendicateur du statut de réfugié, dont l'identité n'est pas contestée, n'est pas crédible pour ce qui est de la crainte subjective d'être persécuté, mais où les conditions dans le pays sont telles que la situation individuelle du revendicateur fait de lui une personne à protéger. (Je souligne)\n[22]\nAinsi l'appréciation de la crainte chez le défendeur doit se faire in concreto, plutôt que dans une perspective abstraite et générale. Le fait que la preuve documentaire illustre de façon inéquivoque la violation systématique et généralisée des droits humains au Pakistan ne suffit absolument pas pour établir la crainte de persecution spécifique et individualisée chez le défendeur en particulier. En l'absence de la moindre preuve pouvant lier la preuve documentaire générale à la situation spécifique du demandeur, je conclus que la Commission n'a pas erré dans sa façon d'analyser la revendication du demandeur sous l'article 97.\n[23]\nAprès l'analyse de l'ensemble du dossier et à la lumière de la décision fort bien motivée de la Commission, je ne peux pas non plus retenir les autres arguments du demandeur. En effet, il s'agit en l'espèce d'un contrôle judiciaire d'une décision presqu'entièrement basée sur l'appréciation de la crédibilité du demandeur en fonction de son témoignage devant la Commission. Il est de la jurisprudence constante de nos tribunaux que la Commission a une expertise bien établie lorsqu'il s'agit de trancher des questions de fait, et notamment d'évaluer la crédibilité des demandeurs d'asile. En fait, l'appréciation des faits constitue la pierre angulaire de la compétence de la Commission. En tant que juge des faits, la Commission est l'instance la mieux placée pour tirer des conclusions raisonnables quant à la crédibilité du récit du demandeur en se fondant sur le manque de vraisemblance, le bon sens et la raison. En conséquence, pour que la Cour puisse annuler une conclusion de fait de la Commission, il faut démontrer que cette conclusion est manifestement déraisonnable, ce qui n'a pas été fait en l'espèce.\n[24]\nEn effet, le demandeur semble déceler dans les motifs de la Commission une incohérence qui n'existe pas. De plus, puisque le demandeur n'a pas été jugé crédible, la Commission était en droit de ne pas accorder de valeur probante aux pièces personnelles que le demandeur a déposées au soutien de sa demande d'asile.\n[25]\nEnfin, il importe de souligner que même si la demande d'asile du demandeur avait été jugée suffisamment crédible par les autorités américaines pour amener sa libération, celle-ci n'a pas été tranchée sur le fond par les autorités américaines et le demandeur ne peut invoquer cette seule libération pour démontrer le bien-fondé de sa demande de refuge. Qui plus est, même si le demandeur s'était vu reconnaître le statut de réfugié aux États-Unis, cela n'implique nullement le fait qu'il aurait pu automatiquement obtenir l'asile au Canada puisque les systèmes canadiens et américains de reconnaissance du statut de réfugié sont distincts et indépendants.\n[26]\nLe fardeau de démontrer que la Commission a erré dans son appréciation de la preuve reposant sur le demandeur et, devant l'absence d'une telle démonstration, je ne vois pas comment l'intervention de cette Cour saurait être justifiée en l'espèce.\n[27]\nPar ces motifs, la demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n[End of document]",

This case was originally cited as [2004] F.T.R. TBEd. JN.019. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nRouleau, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated November 3, 2003, that the applicant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\n[2]\nThe applicant, a 28-year-old citizen of Pakistan, alleges that he qualifies as a person in need of protection because he fears persecution by the police and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) by reason of his political beliefs and his affiliations with the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).\n\n[3]\nIn his Personal Information Form (PIF) and his testimony before the Board, the applicant alleged that his problems with the Pakistani authorities began in 1991 and persisted until his departure from Pakistan on October 28, 2000, to go to the United States where he claimed refugee status. He was incarcerated at first and later released when it was determined that his claim had a minimum of merit. While awaiting his hearing on the merits, the applicant lived and worked in the United States, but, fearing that the commencement of the \"Registration of Aliens\" program, created in the United States following the events of September 11, 2001, would jeopardize his chances of success in his asylum process, the applicant left the United States to come to Canada on March 23, 2003, and applied for refugee status while his case was pending in the United States.\n\n[4]\nThe Board's reasons indicate that it relied on numerous inconsistencies in the applicant's story in order to find that he lacked credibility and that his claim for asylum was completely without merit.\n\n[5]\nMore specifically, the Board noted that the applicant's testimony was interspersed with lengthy moments of hesitation, while he limited himself to repeating his PIF word for word and was unable to provide any particulars beyond the content of the PIF.\n\n[6]\nTo corroborate his claims of affiliation with the PPP, the applicant filed in evidence at the hearing four letters from PPP officials based in Pakistan and New York. However, it was disclosed at the hearing that the applicant did not personally know most of them or had ever met them. Moreover, after examining closely one of the letters filed in evidence by the applicant (a letter from the PPP president in New York), the Board noted that it had been manually falsified.\n\n[7]\nConcerning the probative value to be given to the three other letters, the Board noted that they were not contemporaneous with the events that supposedly occurred, that they had been constituted at the personal request of the applicant's father, not the applicant, and that consequently they were not first-hand evidence since they had been written pursuant to hearsay by the applicant's father.\n\n[8]\nIn his PIF, the applicant alleged that an arrest warrant was issued against him on October 18, 1999. However, the applicant was unable to tell the hearing at what date the warrant had been issued against him. Moreover, the Board noted that the applicant had failed to file this arrest warrant in evidence at the hearing, although he had filed a First Information Report (FIR). The Board was puzzled that the applicant was unable to explain the difference between a FIR and a warrant of arrest in Pakistan.\n\n[9]\nThe applicant justified his failure to file his arrest warrant in evidence by the fact that he had still not received it. When confronted with the inconsistency resulting from the latter statement, the applicant adjusted his testimony and stated that he was no longer really certain that a warrant had indeed been filed against him and that perhaps there was none. Yet the Board noted that earlier in the hearing the applicant had been adamant in his reply when asked whether a warrant had been issued against him, answering \"obviously there is one because the police comes to my house once a month to arrest me.\"\n\n[10]\nFurthermore, the Board found that the allegations of harassment and persecution at the hands of the Pakistani police since 1999 were contradicted by the documentary evidence, which reports that it is high profile members who are targeted. So the Board thought it improbable that the police would issue a FIR against the applicant in 1999 when, by his own account, he had ceased his political activities in 1994.\n\n[11]\nFinally, the Board reports in its reasons that the applicant's conduct - the fact that he had renewed his Pakistani passport at New York, on September 26, 2001 - was incompatible with that of a refugee. Citing articles 41 and 49 of the UN's Handbook on Procedures and Criteria, the Board held that this conduct denied the existence of a subjective fear in Pakistan.\n\n[12]\nAll of these reasons led the Board to reject the applicant's claim.\n\n[13]\nThe applicant's main argument is the claim that the Board erred in dwelling solely on an analysis of the applicant's circumstances from the standpoint of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act), and then using this analysis to reject the applicant's claim under section 97 of the Act. The applicant submits that this approach is erroneous because it contradicts the intention of Parliament by making these two sections into one and stripping section 97 of its content and rationale.\n\n[14]\nIn support of this submission, the applicant refers to the decision of this Court in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Mr. Justice Blanchard stated:\n 41 A claim under section 97 must be evaluated with respect to all the relevant considerations and with a view to the country's human rights record. While the Board must assess the applicant's claim objectively, the analysis must still be individualized. I am satisfied that this interpretation is not only consistent with the United Nations CAT decisions considered above, but is also supported by the wording of paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Act, which refers to persons, \"... whose removal ... would subject them personally ...\". There may well be instances where a refugee claimant, whose identity is not disputed, is found to be not credible with respect to his subjective fear of persecution, but the country conditions are such that the claimant's particular circumstances, make him/her a person in need of protection. It follows that a negative credibility determination, which may be determinative of a refugee claim under s. 96 of the Act, is not necessarily determinative of a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act. The elements required to establish a claim under section 97 differ from those required under section 96 of the Act where a well-founded fear of persecution to a convention ground must be established.\n\n[15]\nThus, the applicant argues, the Board erred in using its findings on lack of credibility to dismiss the applicant's fear of persecution. The Board, he submits, should not have confined itself to saying the applicant was not credible without considering the documentary evidence establishing systematic violations of human rights committed in Pakistan.\n\n[16]\nThe applicant further alleges that the Board's decision was unfair and arbitrary since it failed to consider a number of items of evidence, as well as a significant portion of his testimony. Furthermore, he says, the Board adopted contradictory and irreconcilable positions concerning his credibility.\n\n[17]\nThe applicant also argues that the Board erred in requiring a more demanding burden of proof than the one required by the Act, and that this necessitates the intervention of this Court.\n\n[18]\nFinally, he alleges that the Board erred in applying Canadian standards in its assessment of his conduct without taking cultural differences into account.\n\n[19]\nThe respondent notes that the reasons for rejecting the claim largely pertain to inconsistencies in the applicant's testimony at the hearing, and argues that the deficiencies in question, indicated by the Board, cannot attract the intervention of this Court.\n\n[20]\nThe respondent further submits that the applicant, in attempting to cite an inconsistency in the Board's decision, presents at several places in his memorandum conclusions drawn by the Board that are in fact simply allegations by the applicant that were repeated by the Board.\n\n[21]\nFirst of all, I wish to point out that the relevant test under section 96 is in fact quite distinct from the test under section 97. A claim based on section 97 requires the Board to apply a different criterion pertaining to the issue of whether the applicant's removal may or may not expose him personally to the risks and dangers referred to in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. However, this criterion must be assessed in light of the personal characteristics of the applicant. Indeed, as Blanchard J. noted in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n 41 [T]he wording of paragraph 97(1)(a) of the Act ... refers to persons, \"... whose removal ... would subject them personally ...\". There may well be instances where a refugee claimant, whose identity is not disputed, is found to be not credible with respect to his subjective fear of persecution, but the country conditions are such that the claimant's particular circumstances, make him/her a person in need of protection. [Emphasis added]\n\n[22]\nThus the assessment of the applicant's fear must be made in concreto, and not from an abstract and general perspective. The fact that the documentary evidence illustrates unequivocally the systematic and generalized violation of human rights in Pakistan is simply not sufficient to establish the specific and individualized fear of persecution of the applicant in particular. Absent the least proof that might link the general documentary evidence to the applicant's specific circumstances, I conclude that the Board did not err in the way it analyzed the applicant's claim under section 97.\n\n[23]\nHaving analyzed the case as a whole, and in light of the very strongly argued decision of the Board, I am unable likewise to adopt the other submissions of the applicant. This is a case of judicial review of a decision almost entirely based on the assessment of the applicant's credibility in terms of his testimony before the Board. It has been consistently held by our courts that the Board has well established expertise when it comes to determining questions of fact and in particular assessing the credibility of asylum seekers. In fact, the assessment of the facts constitutes the cornerstone of the Board's jurisdiction. As the trier of facts, the Board is the body that is in the best position to draw reasonable findings as to the credibility of the claimant's story, basing itself on improbability, common sense and reason. Consequently, if the Court is to set aside a finding of fact by the Board it must be demonstrated that this finding is patently unreasonable, and that has not been done in this case.\n\n[24]\nIn fact, the applicant appears to detect in the Board's reasons an inconsistency that does not exist. And since the applicant was not considered credible, the Board was entitled not to assign probative value to the personal exhibits the applicant filed in support of his refugee claim.\n\n[25]\nFinally, it should be noted that even if the applicant's claim for asylum had been considered sufficiently credible by the U.S. authorities to result in his release, that claim was not decided on the merits by the U.S. authorities and the applicant cannot rely on this release alone to demonstrate the merit of his refugee claim. Furthermore, even if the applicant had been awarded refugee status in the United States, that does not imply that he could automatically obtain asylum in Canada, since the Canadian and U.S. systems for recognizing refugee status are distinct and independent.\n\n[26]\nThe onus of demonstrating that the Board erred in its assessment of the evidence rested on the applicant, and in the absence of any such demonstration I do not see how the intervention of this Court could be warranted in this case.\n\n[27]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.\n....................\nHasib Ahmad (plaintiff) v.
