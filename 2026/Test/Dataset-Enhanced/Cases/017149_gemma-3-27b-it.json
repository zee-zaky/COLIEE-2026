    "[1]\nReed, J.\n: Two motions were heard concurrently. The defendant brings a motion to appeal a decision of the Prothonotary that certified the plaintiffs as a class and appointed Mr. Pawar as their representative plaintiff. The plaintiff brings a motion to appeal the decision of the Prothonotary, made at the same time, that struck the plaintiff's claim for damages from the statement of claim [see footnote 1].",
    "[2]\nIt is agreed that the test to be applied, on an appeal of a Prothonotary's decision, is set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).",
    "[3]\nIt is necessary to start with Federal Court Rule 1711 [see footnote 2]. Subsection (1) provides:\n\"1711(1)\nWhere numerous person have the same interest\nin any proceeding,\nthe proceeding may be begun\n, and unless the court otherwise orders, continued,\nby\nor against any\none or more of them representing all\nor as representing all except one or more of them.\"",
    "[4]\nCounsel for the respondent argues that the history of class actions demonstrates that they are appropriate for reasons of judicial economy and efficiency, finality of dispute resolution, and to ensure that all those affected by the decision have an opportunity to put their position to the court. In this case she argues, once the damage claim is struck out, there is no reason to continue with a class action. It is argued that if Mr. Pawar is successful in having a declaration made that s. 3 of the\nOld Age Security Act\nis unconstitutional, all members of the class will benefit regardless of whether they are plaintiffs or not. She argues that it is not necessary to pursue a class action to obtain a declaration of constitutional invalidity, and that it is generally undesirable to do so:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 361.",
    "[5]\nThe Prothonotary dealt with these arguments albeit before the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision was rendered; in his reasons that issued on December 2, 1996, he wrote:\n\"To begin, the defendant submits that should Mr. Pawar succeed in obtaining his declaration and damages there would be no need for a class action, for everyone who could bring themselves within whatever principle Mr. Pawar was able to establish might also successfully apply for a pension. I have already touched on one reason why this argument is invalid: many people are not able to have access to the judicial system except by way of class action, for the expense of litigation by individuals is, today, prohibitive: a class action shares that cost burden. A second answer is that should Mr. Pawar not succeed, the result does not necessarily mean that others in the same class might not try different arguments in subsequent proceedings, resulting in many actions, at substantial costs to the litigants and to the public, which is something a class action seeks to avoid.\n. . . . .\n\"The defendant submits the class proceeding aspect of the statement of claim ought to be struck out for there is no economy in this approach as compared with an action by Mr. Pawar alone. This may to an extent be so for a class action, by itself, will be more costly. However, there may also be a saving in avoiding similar actions by others. Also a representative proceeding and this is an important point, increases the access to the court, in the case of an action which may well be fairly complex, at very little cost. These submissions, individually or collectively, fail to convince me that it is plain and obvious that the action, as a representative action, cannot succeed, or even that it is so unsuitable as a representative proceeding that it ought not reasonably be allowed to continue as such.\"",
    "[6]\nSubsequent to that decision, the Prothonotary again dealt with this issue, in reasons dated May 26, 1997, which reasons pertain to the order under appeal in the present application. While, at that time, he struck out the plaintiff's claim for damages, he certified the class, for the purposes of this action, as those persons who reside in Canada and would be eligible to receive an old age security pension if there was no 10 year residency requirement in the legislation, and he appointed Mr. Pawar as a representative plaintiff [see footnote 3].",
    "[7]\nWith respect to the defendant's argument that it was inappropriate to allow this case to proceed as a class action, the Prothonotary wrote, in his reasons of May 26, 1997:\n\"Counsel for the plaintiff also submits that there is no need for a representative action, a point already dealt with in my reasons of 2 December 1996. There, I touched on the preference of a representative action to a plethora of similar proceedings, economics in the context of the feasibility of a number of individuals to afford the luxury of litigation, the benefit of a class action to the public who might otherwise have to pay the lion's share of the cost to the justice system of a number of parallel actions and the benefit to individuals in the class of having their day in court, even if only by proxy.\"",
    "[8]\nI do not find that the Prothonotary mischaracterized the facts or that he misapplied the appropriate law. The comments at page 361 of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision relate to a provision of the\nQuebec Civil Code of Procedure\n. It differs in content from the rule 1711. More importantly, however, those comments are obiter and leave open the question of when a class action is an appropriate vehicle for pursuing a challenge to the constitutionality of a legislative provision. For the reasons given by the Prothonotary, the circumstances in this case are of such a type as to make it appropriate to allow the litigation to be pursued by way of a class action.",
    "[9]\nWith respect to the argument that Mr. Pawar is not a appropriate representative because he is now receiving an old age security pension, that argument is not persuasive. At the commencement of the litigation Mr. Pawar was not receiving pension benefits. He played a key role in initiating the litigation. He has played and plays a key role in publicizing the issue being litigated and in gathering support for the litigation. There is no conflict between his position and that of the other members of the class. He is an appropriate representative plaintiff.",
    "[10]\nI turn then to the plaintiff's motion that the paragraphs in the Statement of Claim, seeking damages for old age security benefits should not have been struck out. In the Prothonotary's first decision, on December 2, 1996, he did not strike those paragraphs. When that same issue, albeit in a different form, was considered again by him when writing his reasons of May 26, 1997, the Supreme Court had rendered its decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This caused the Prothonotary to strike the claim for damages. The <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision leaves no doubt as to the applicable law. At page 360, the following explanation is given:\n\"The Divisional Court of Ontario in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 48-49, applied the de facto doctrine to deny an action for\nCharter\ndamages arising from an unconstitutional statute. As Henry, J., explained:\n'[W]e consider the law to be clear that no cause of action exists for the conduct of the appellants as agents and representatives of the registrar when acting within the authority of the legislation in the absence of any allegation of wrongful conduct, bad faith, negligence or collateral purpose. The statutes are to be given full force and effect until set aside.'\n\"It is against this backdrop that the comments of Lamer, C.J., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 720, are read:\n'An individual remedy under s. 24(1) of the\nCharter\nwill rarely be available in conjunction with an action under s. 52 of the\nConstitution Act, 1982\n. Ordinarily, where a provision is declared unconstitutional and immediately struck down pursuant to s. 52, that will be the end of the matter. No retroactive s. 24 remedy will be available.'\n\"Although it cannot be said that damages can never be obtained following a declaration of constitutional invalidity, it is true, as a general rule, that an action for damages under s. 24(1) of the\nCharter\ncannot be coupled with the declaratory action for invalidity under s. 52 of the\nConstitution Act, 1982\n.\"",
    "[11]\nThe Prothonotary notes in his reasons of May 26, 1997:\n\"In the present instance there is no allegation in the statement of claim of any of the elements suggested as necessary in the\nCrown Trust\ncase to found a claim for damages, namely wrongful conduct, bad faith, negligence or collateral purpose. Counsel for the plaintiff submits there was some wrongful element in the Crown repeatedly refusing Mr. Pawar a pension each time he applied. However, mere refusals by Crown servants charged with enforcing a clear legislative provision, to a persistent claimant, are not in any way improper conduct.\"",
    "[12]\nThere was no error of fact or law on the part of the Prothonotary and, indeed, even if I were to exercise my discretion de novo I would have reached no different decisions from those reached by the Prothonotary, whether the decision be the certification of the class, the appointment of Mr. Pawar, or the striking of the damage claim.",
    "[13]\nFor the reasons given the motions will be dismissed.\nMotions dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/gs\nFootnotes\n1.This is an appeal brought by the defendant, and a cross-appeal brought by the plaintiff, from the Order of Mr. John A. Hargrave, Prothonotary, dated May 26, 1997, wherein he ordered as follows:\n\"1. The Class consisting of those persons who reside in Canada and would be eligible for an Old Age Security Pension, but for an inability to meet the 10 year residency requirement, is certified;\n\"2. Harbans Singh Pawar is appointed as representative plaintiff for the Class.\n\"3. That portion of the action seeking a declaration under s. 52 of the\nConstitution Act, 1982\n, is certified as a class action: the claim for damages, under s. 24 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n, embodied in parties (b) and (d) of the relief claimed, shall not proceed as a class action and shall be deleted, by amendment to the statement of claim, within 30 days; and\n\"4. Costs shall be in the cause.\"\n2.The rule in its entirety reads:\n\"1711(1) Where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding, the proceeding may be begun, and, unless the court otherwise orders, continued, by or against any one or more of them as representing all or as representing all except one or more of them.\n\"(2) At any stage of a proceeding under this rule, the court may, on the application of the plaintiff, and on such terms, if any, as it thinks fit, appoint any one or more of the defendants or other persons as representing whom the defendants are sued to represent all, or all except one or more, of those persons in the proceeding; and where, in exercise of the power conferred by this paragraph, the court appoints a person not named as a defendant, it shall make an order adding that person as a defendant.\n\"(3) Where an order is made under this rule, it shall contain directions as to consequential pleadings or other steps and any interested party may apply for supplementary directions.\n\"(4) A judgment or order given in a proceeding under this rule shall be binding on all the persons as representing whom the plaintiffs sue or, as the case may be, the defendants are sued, but shall not be enforced against any person not a party to the proceeding without leave of the court, which leave will only be granted on an application notice of which has been served personally upon the person against whom it is sought to enforce the judgment or order.\n\"(5) Notwithstanding that a judgment or order to which any such application relates is binding on the person against whom the application is made, that person may dispute liability to have the judgment or order enforced against him on the ground that by reason of facts and matters particular to his case he is entitled to be exempted from such liability.\n\"(6) The court hearing an application for leave under paragraph (4) may order the question whether the judgment or order is enforceable against the person against whom the application is made to be tried and determined in any manner in which any issue or question in an action may be tried and determined.\"\n3.Why it was necessary to certify and appoint in this manner is not entirely clear since the action had already been commenced in that form and confirmed by the earlier decision of December 2, 1996.\n[End of document]"

Counsel for the plaintiff submits there was some wrongful element in the Crown repeatedly refusing Mr. Pawar a pension each time he applied. However, mere refusals by Crown servants charged with enforcing a clear legislative provision, to a persistent claimant, are not in any way improper conduct.\"\n\n[12]\nThere was no error of fact or law on the part of the Prothonotary and, indeed, even if I were to exercise my discretion de novo I would have reached no different decisions from those reached by the Prothonotary, whether the decision be the certification of the class, the appointment of Mr. Pawar, or the striking of the damage claim.\n\n[13]\nFor the reasons given the motions will be dismissed.\nMotions dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/gs\nFootnotes\n1.This is an appeal brought by the defendant, and a cross-appeal brought by the plaintiff, from the Order of Mr. John A. Hargrave, Prothonotary, dated May 26, 1997, wherein he ordered as follows:\n\"1. The Class consisting of those persons who reside in Canada and would be eligible for an Old Age Security Pension, but for an inability to meet the 10 year residency requirement, is certified;\n\"2. Harbans Singh Pawar is appointed as representative plaintiff for the Class.\n\"3. That portion of the action seeking a declaration under s. 52 of the\nConstitution Act, 1982\n, is certified as a class action: the claim for damages, under s. 24 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n, embodied in parties (b) and (d) of the relief claimed, shall not proceed as a class action and shall be deleted, by amendment to the statement of claim, within 30 days; and\n\"4. Costs shall be in the cause.\"\n2.The rule in its entirety reads:\n\"1711(1) Where numerous persons have the same interest in any proceeding, the proceeding may be begun, and, unless the court otherwise orders, continued, by or against any one or more of them as representing all or as representing all except one or more of them.\n\"(2) At any stage of a proceeding under this rule, the court may, on the application of the plaintiff, and on such terms, if any, as it thinks fit, appoint any one or more of the defendants or other persons as representing whom the defendants are sued to represent all, or all except one or more, of those persons in the proceeding; and where, in exercise of the power conferred by this paragraph, the court appoints a person not named as a defendant, it shall make an order adding that person as a defendant.\n\"(3) Where an order is made under this rule, it shall contain directions as to consequential pleadings or other steps and any interested party may apply for supplementary directions.\n\"(4) A judgment or order given in a proceeding under this rule shall be binding on all the persons as representing whom the plaintiffs sue or, as the case may be, the defendants are sued, but shall not be enforced against any person not a party to the proceeding without leave of the court, which leave will only be granted on an application notice of which has been served personally upon the person against whom it is sought to enforce the judgment or order.\n\"(5) Notwithstanding that a judgment or order to which any such application relates is binding on the person against whom the application is made, that person may dispute liability to have the judgment or order enforced against him on the ground that by reason of facts and matters particular to his case he is entitled to be exempted from such liability.\n\"(6) The court hearing an application for leave under paragraph (4) may order the question whether the judgment or order is enforceable against the person against whom the application is made to be tried and determined in any manner in which any issue or question in an action may be tried and determined.\"\n3.Why it was necessary to certify and appoint in this manner is not entirely clear since the action had already been commenced in that form and confirmed by the earlier decision of December 2, 1996.\n[End of document]",

        "A class action is necessary because individual litigation is prohibitively expensive, ensuring access to justice for those who cannot afford it.",

        "Once the damage claim is struck, there is no reason to continue as a class action.",
        "A declaration of unconstitutionality benefits all class members regardless of individual claims, making a class action unnecessary.",

        "Mr. Pawar is not an appropriate representative plaintiff because he is now receiving Old Age Security benefits.",
        "The claim for damages should have been struck out as no cause of action exists for Charter damages arising from an unconstitutional statute without allegations of wrongful conduct, bad faith, negligence, or collateral purpose.",
        "Mere refusals to pay benefits based on a clear legislative provision do not constitute improper conduct sufficient to support a damages claim."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed the Prothonotary’s decision to certify the class action, finding it appropriate given the potential for numerous similar individual actions, the economic benefits of consolidated litigation, and increased access to justice for those who could not afford to litigate individually.",
      "The court distinguished the case from the comments in *Fragment Suppressed* regarding constitutional challenges, noting those comments related to Quebec procedural law and were obiter, leaving open the question of when a class action is suitable for constitutional challenges.",
      "The court found the Prothonotary did not err in striking the claim for damages, relying on the principle established in *Fragment Suppressed* and *Crown Trust*, which holds that a claim for damages is generally unavailable alongside a constitutional challenge under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, absent allegations of wrongful conduct, bad faith, negligence, or collateral purpose.",
      "The court agreed with the Prothonotary that the plaintiff’s claim lacked the necessary allegations of improper conduct to support a damages claim, as mere refusals to pay benefits based on a clear legislative provision are not improper.",
      "The court upheld the appointment of Mr. Pawar as representative plaintiff, finding his initial involvement in the litigation, his role in publicizing the issue, and the absence of a conflict of interest sufficient justification, despite him now receiving benefits."
