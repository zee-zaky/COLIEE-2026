    "[1]\nCampbell, J.\n: In December 1998, the Applicant, who at the time held the rank of Corporal in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, plead guilty to two allegations of disgraceful conduct according to the disciplinary procedures provided in ss. 37 - 45.17 of the\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Act\n,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Police (the \"Commissioner\"), the Applicant was demoted to the rank of Constable. The Applicant objects to the demotion and seeks to set it aside by the present application.",
    "[2]\nThe disciplinary process provided under the\nAct\nfirst involves a hearing before an Adjudicative Board in which evidence is called with respect to the allegations, and if founded, with respect to the sanction to be imposed. An appeal lies to the Commissioner from a decision of the Adjudicative Board. However, before considering an appeal, the Commissioner must refer the case to an External Review Committee for the purpose of receiving findings and recommendations which must be considered before rendering an appeal decision. In addition to the recommendations, the Commissioner must consider the record of the hearing before the Adjudication Board, the statement of appeal, and any written submissions made. The Commissioner is not bound by the External Review Committee's recommendations, but if they are not followed, he must give reasons for doing so.",
    "[3]\nBefore the Adjudication Board, the Applicant plead guilty to the following allegations and, in the course of so doing, admitted the following particulars:\n\"\nAllegation #1:\n\"On or about the 8th day of March, 1997 at or near the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, Cpl. R.A. Lee conducted himself in a disgraceful manner that brings discredit on the Force, contrary to Regulation 39(1) of the\nCode of Conduct of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\n, being s. 39(1) of the\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations (1988)\n.\nParticulars:\n1. At all material times, you were a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stationed in 'E' Division.\n2. While off duty, on or about 97-03-08, you were operating a covert police motor vehicle, proceeding southbound along the Cambie Street Bridge, in Vancouver, B.C.\n3. While in operation of the motor vehicle, your ability to do so was impaired by alcohol.\n\"\nAllegation #3:\n\"On or about the 8th day of March 1997, at or near the City of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, Cpl. R.A. Lee conducted himself in a disgraceful manner that brings discredit on the Force, contrary to regulation 39(1) of the\nCode of Conduct of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\n, being s. 39(1) of the\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations (1988)\n.\nParticulars:\n1. At all material times, you were a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stationed in 'E' Division.\n2. While off duty, on or about 97-03-08, you were operating a covert police motor vehicle, proceeding southbound along the Cambie Street Bridge, in Vancouver, B.C.\n3. You were stopped by a road check manned by the Vancouver City Police, and instructed to pull your vehicle to the curb.\n4. You then accelerated the motor vehicle past the road check area and off of the Cambie St. Bridge.\n5. Members of the Vancouver Police Department pursued your vehicle.\n6. While being pursued, you drove your motor vehicle [you proceeded] through an intersection against a red light. While doing so, you collided with a vehicle in the intersection.\n7. You continued to proceed through the city streets, failing to stop after the collision. While continuing onward in your vehicle you exceeded posted speed limits, and disregarded the laws pertaining to the safe operation of a motor vehicle in the province of British Columbia.\" [see footnote 1]",
    "[4]\nWith respect to the sanction to be imposed, before the Adjudicative Board the Applicant called evidence to support his assertion that at the time of his conduct he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") stemming from his service in a United Nations policing contingent deployed to Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992-1993, and subsequent traumatic incidents experienced as an undercover drug enforcement officer. Indeed, the Applicant produced medical opinion which supported his assertion that the root \"cause\" of his dishonourable conduct was the PTSD, and this, together with an excellent prognosis for the future, should be given strong weight as mitigating factors.",
    "[5]\nWhile finding that, were it not for the PTSD expert evidence, dismissal might be the appropriate result, the Adjudication Board imposed the following sanctions: reprimand; demotion from the position of Corporal to the position of Constable; and recommendations that the Applicant continue with counselling and after-care treatment and be transferred with a change of duties from drug enforcement.",
    "[6]\nThe Applicant appealed to the Commissioner. The External Review Committee accepted the Applicant's PTSD mitigation argument and recommended that the sanction imposed should include a forfeiture of ten day's pay in lieu of demotion together with the other terms imposed by the Adjudication Board. However, upon considering the full record, the Commissioner dismissed the appeal and upheld the demotion for the following reasons:\n\"I have given careful consideration to all aspects of this case. This is a very serious breach of the code of conduct. In normal circumstances, dismissal would be an appropriate sanction given that Corporal Lee fled the scene of the stop, was involved in subsequent accident and fled that scene, all the while in a legally impaired condition. I am influenced, however, by the mitigating circumstances of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which could have influenced his judgment. At the same time, however, Corporal Lee was previously counselled for using alcohol while driving a police car in November 1993. Taking into account all the mitigating and aggravating factors, I am of the view that the sanction imposed by the Board is appropriate. While I am sympathetic to the arguments advanced by the Committee, I must disagree with the assertion that a demotion should relate only to on the job behaviour. A leader must be seen to be a role model and serious criminal behaviour, whether on or off duty and regardless of some mitigating circumstances which may have influenced the behaviour, is in my considered opinion, an important element in determining suitability to supervise from the point of view of integrity, credibility and judgment. There are three constituencies at issue: 1) the member, 2) the organization and, 3) the public interest. A police agency is expected to set high standards and must be seen to exercise those standards in an appropriate fashion. I believe the sanction in this case balances the interests of the three constituencies. The appeal is dismissed. I confirm the Board's decision imposing upon Corporal Lee a reprimand and an immediate demotion to the rank of constable and recommending a transfer and that counselling and after-care treatment be continued.\n\"I am pleased to see that Corporal Lee has rehabilitated himself and I urge him to continue his efforts in that regard and to share his experiences as to the effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with others.\" [see footnote 2]",
    "[7]\nThe Applicant's purpose in bringing the present application is only to set aside the Commissioner's decision confirming the Board of Adjudication's decision to demote him from the rank of Corporal to Constable.",
    "[8]\nWith respect to the standard of review to be applied, it is agreed that, following the Appeal Division decision of this court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), the Commissioner's decision cannot be set aside unless it is shown to be patently unreasonable. [see footnote 3]",
    "[9]\nThe Applicant argues that the error which renders the Commissioner's decision patently unreasonable is the Commissioner's finding that the PTSD \"could have influenced\" the Applicant's judgment rather than to have \"caused\" the misconduct itself as was expressed in the medical opinion produced before the Adjudication Board.",
    "[10]\nIn my opinion, there is no error in this finding. The Commissioner is entitled to assign weight to expert opinion on the record, and, in so doing in the present case, was distinctly influenced by the expert opinion concerning PTSD, but not to the extent argued by the Applicant or recommended by the External Review Committee.",
    "[11]\nThe second argument in support of interfering with the Commissioner's decision is the argument that the Applicant's equality rights under s. 15 of the\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms\nhave been offended because he was demoted because of his PTSD illness.",
    "[12]\nAs was the case with the deliberations of both the Adjudication Board and the External Review Committee, the Commissioner's decision is simply the result of a weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors. I find that the s. 15 argument respecting the demotion is groundless because there is no evidence whatsoever to establish that the Applicant suffered any differential treatment.",
    "[13]\nAccordingly, this application is dismissed. I award no costs.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/gs\nFootnotes\n1. Applicant's Application Record, pp. 229-230.\n2.

This standard was based on precedent regarding the RCMP's disciplinary process, which is designed with multiple layers of review and should only be intervened in under exceptional circumstances.",
      "The court found no error in the Commissioner's assessment of the PTSD evidence, specifically his conclusion that PTSD 'could have influenced' the applicant's judgment rather than definitively 'caused' the misconduct. The court reasoned that the Commissioner was entitled to weigh expert opinion and did not err in assigning a different level of causation than suggested by the applicant or the External Review Committee.",
      "The court rejected the applicant's claim of a Charter violation under section 15 (equality rights) because there was no evidence of differential treatment based on his PTSD. The demotion was determined to be the result of a balancing of mitigating (PTSD, rehabilitation efforts) and aggravating (prior misconduct, fleeing the scene of an accident while impaired) factors, and not discrimination.",
      "The court emphasized the Commissioner’s consideration of multiple constituencies – the member, the organization, and the public interest – in reaching his decision. The court found the Commissioner appropriately balanced these interests when determining that a leader must be seen to uphold high standards of conduct, even for off-duty behavior, to maintain integrity and credibility.",
      "The court affirmed the Commissioner’s decision to uphold the demotion, finding it proportionate given the seriousness of the misconduct and the need to maintain public confidence in the RCMP, despite acknowledging the mitigating factor of PTSD."
