    "[1]\nMartineau, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review under section 72 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the\nIRPA\n) of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (the Appeal Division) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) dated October 9, 2003, wherein the Appeal Division determined that the appeal filed by the applicant should be dismissed on a lack of jurisdiction.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant sponsored her husband's application for landing in Canada. The visa officer refused the application because there were grounds to believe that her husband was a member of an organisation engaged or that will be engaged in terrorism. Pursuant to paragraphs 34(1)(c) and (f) of the\nIRPA\na foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for engaging in terrorism or being a member of an organisation where there are reasonable grounds to believe he is engaged, has engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism.",
    "[3]\nThe applicant has appealed the refusal of the sponsored application pursuant to subsection 63(1) of the\nIRPA\n. The appeal was dismissed on a lack of jurisdiction. In effect, subsection 64(1) of the\nIRPA\nclearly establishes that no appeal may be made to the Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor if the foreign national has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security (section 34 of the\nIRPA\n).",
    "[4]\nSubsection 64(1) reads as follows:\n\"64(1) No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious crime or organized crime.\"\n\"64(1) An appeal may not be filed by a permanent resident or a foreign national who is inadmissible for reasons of security or for violation of human or international rights, serious crime or organized crime, nor, in the case of a foreign national, his sponsor.\"",
    "[5]\nThe scope of the Appeal Division's jurisdiction in such a case was recently examined by this Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 265 F.T.R. 184; 2005 F.C. 297. At paragraphs 41 and 42, MacTavish, J., noted:\n\"From a plain reading of the statute, I am satisfied that the jurisdictional question for the IAD is not whether the foreign national (or his or her sponsor) is in fact inadmissible, but rather whether the individual in question has been found to be inadmissible on one of the enumerated bases. Once that question is answered in the affirmative, the status is clear: the IAD is without jurisdiction to deal further with the matter.\n\"If I were to accept Ms. Kang's submission that it was incumbent on the IAD to determine whether or not Mr. Kang was in fact inadmissible, in order to decide whether it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, this interpretation would have the effect of rendering section 64 of\nIRPA\nlargely meaningless. Requiring that the Board revisit the question of admissibility would essentially confer a right of appeal on the very individuals who have been denied such a right by virtue of the section.\"",
    "[6]\nDespite the noble efforts made by the applicant's counsel to convince me that the approach taken in\nKang\n, supra, is inconsistent with the decision rendered in 1980 by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), or is otherwise wrong in law, I find both reproaches unfounded.",
    "[7]\nAs was implicitly found in\nKang\n, the decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, is not determinative of the issue that this Court has to resolve in the present case (see\nKang\n, supra, at para. 32 to 36). Indeed, in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, subsection 72(1) of the former\nImmigration Act\n, 1976 S. C. 1976-77, c. 52 (the old\nAct\n) gave a right of appeal to a \"permanent resident.\" While subsection 24(2) of the old\nAct\nwas concerned with loss of status, it had not been incorporated by reference into the definition of \"permanent resident\" in subsection 2(1) of the old\nAct\n. Only subsection 24(1) of the old\nAct\nhad been incorporated by reference into the definition. Thurlow, C.J., stated at paragraph 5:\n\"The question posed by subsection 24(1) is whether the 'permanent resident' left or remained outside Canada with the intention of abandoning Canada as his place of permanent residence. That is a question of fact to be assessed in the first instance by an immigration officer faced with the question and to be resolved at a second stage by an adjudicator.\nBut the statute, in subsection 72(1), gives to a 'permanent resident' against whom a removal order has been made, a right to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board. A person who has been granted landing and who in fact has not left or remained outside Canada with the intention of abandoning Canada as his place of permanent residence is thus entitled to appeal, notwithstanding a finding by an adjudicator that he had left or remained outside Canada with the intention of abandoning Canada as his place of permanent residence\n. Any other interpretation of subsections 24(1) and 72(1) would have the effect of making the adjudicator's finding on the point final and unappealable even though subsection 59(1) gives the Immigration Appeal Board 'sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact; including questions of jurisdiction, that may arise in relation to the making of a removal order' and even though under subsection 76(1) the Board, on an appeal under section 72, is authorized to quash a removal order. I do not think an interpretation of subsections 24(1) and 72(1) that would negate such a person's right of appeal should be adopted. In my opinion,\non an appeal by a person against whom a removal order has been made on the basis of a conclusion by the adjudicator that the person is no longer a permanent resident\nbecause he left or remained outside Canada with the intention of abandoning Canada as his place of permanent residence,\nthe Immigration Appeal Board has jurisdiction to hear evidence and determine the fact upon which the right to appeal depends\n.\" (My underlinings)",
    "[8]\nAddy, J., who also provided reasons in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, remarked at paragraphs 21, 22 and 23:\n\"Subsections (1) and (2) of section 72 provide for cases where a removal order has been made and subsection (3), where a deportation order has been made. Removal order, by section 2(1) includes an exclusion order as well as a deportation order.\nSubsection (1) of section 72 provides for an appeal by a permanent resident\nor by a person lawfully in possession of a valid returning permit. A permanent resident is entitled to be issued a valid returning permit before leaving.\nHowever, a permanent resident with respect to whom security or criminal intelligence reports have been made does not possess a right of appeal under this subsection\n. No such impediment seems to be imposed in the case of a person with a valid resident returning permit, presumably because the permit would most likely be cancelled should the intelligence activities appear to warrant it.\n\"\nSubsection (2) provides for appeals available to a Convention refugee or to a person in possession of a valid visa seeking admission and against whom a report has been made by an immigration officer who feels that he is not legally admissible\n. Finally, subsection (3) applies to persons falling in the same categories as those mentioned in subsection (2) but who are the object of a deportation order rather than an exclusion order and in respect of whom a certificate of the Minister and the Solicitor General has been filed based on security or criminal intelligence reports or who has been determined by an adjudicator to be in an inadmissible class as a spy, or subversive agent or a person likely to engage in acts of violence, etc.\n\"Specific and different grounds of appeal are provided for in relation to the three main categories of appellants mentioned in each of these subsections of section 72.\nIt must necessarily follow that the class or category under which a particular appellant falls must be determined by the Immigration Appeal Board before it can decide the extent and nature of its jurisdiction in any particular case\n. For an appeal to be considered under section 72(1), the Board must satisfy itself that the appellant falls within one of the two categories mentioned therein, otherwise his appeal could not be considered under that provision.\nThe question in such a case of determining whether a person is or is not a permanent resident is therefore fundamental to the exercise of the Board's jurisdiction\n.\" (My underlinings)",
    "[9]\nSections 63 to 67 of the\nIRPA\nwhich regulate appeals to the Appeal Division now use a different language and are not equivalent to sections 59 and 72 of the old\nAct\n. Moreover, it is clear that subsection 64(1) of the\nIRPA\n, which has to be read in conjunction with subsection 64(2) of the\nIRPA\nin cases of serious criminality (section 36 of the\nIRPA\n), does not invite the Appeal Division to make a determination on the status of the individual. The question of status is already addressed at section 63 of the\nIRPA\n. Subsection 64(1) of the\nIRPA\nis strictly concerned with the issue of determining whether the individual \"\nhas\nbeen found to be inadmissible\" on one of the enumerated grounds. Therefore, in order to exercise its jurisdiction, it is not necessary that the Appeal Division look into the facts which have led to the finding that the individual in question has been found inadmissible on one of the enumerated grounds.",
    "[10]\nIn the case at bar, the Appeal Division had no jurisdiction to reconsider the inadmissibility finding made by the visa officer. In my opinion, the clear wording of subsection 64(1), together with the object of the\nIRPA\nand its scheme, preclude the Appeal Division from reconsidering the finding of inadmissibility made by an authorized decision-maker, in this case, a visa officer. If Parliament had intended in the first place to grant a right of appeal de novo with respect to the existence of one of the enumerated grounds mentioned in subsection 64(1) of the\nIRPA\n, clearer language would have been used. This is not the case here.",
    "[11]\nI have also considered the other arguments made by the applicant's counsel, as well as his proposed question for certification. They do not constitute valid reasons for deviating from\nKang\n, supra, and they do not, in my opinion, raise a question of general importance. In both cases, I accept the respondent's submissions.\nORDER",
    "[12]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that the present application for judicial review be dismissed. No question of general importance shall be certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/vnh\n[End of document]"

        "The Appeal Division should have considered whether the husband was *in fact* inadmissible, rather than simply whether a finding of inadmissibility had been made.",

      "Respondents": [
        "Subsection 64(1) of the IRPA clearly establishes that no appeal may be made to the Appeal Division if the foreign national has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security.",
        "The Appeal Division’s jurisdiction is determined by whether a finding of inadmissibility has been made, not whether the individual is *in fact* inadmissible.",
        "The decision in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> does not govern the issue in the present case.",
        "Sections 63 to 67 of the IRPA are not equivalent to sections 59 and 72 of the old Act.",
        "Subsection 64(1) of the IRPA does not require the Appeal Division to make a determination on the individual’s status.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a visa officer’s decision finding the applicant’s husband inadmissible on security grounds (terrorism). The court affirmed the IAD’s dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",
      "The court interpreted section 64(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) as establishing a clear jurisdictional bar: if a foreign national or their sponsor has been *found* inadmissible on specified grounds (including security), no appeal lies to the IAD. The focus is on whether a finding of inadmissibility has been made, not on independently re-assessing the factual basis for that finding.",
      "The court relied heavily on its prior decision in *Kang*, which established that the IAD’s jurisdiction is triggered by the *existence* of a finding of inadmissibility, not by a determination of *whether* inadmissibility actually exists. Re-examining the factual basis for inadmissibility would render section 64 largely meaningless and effectively grant an appeal where Parliament intended to deny one.",
      "The court distinguished the current statutory scheme from the previous Immigration Act (1976), specifically noting that sections 63-67 of the IRPA differ from sections 59 and 72 of the old Act. The prior case law regarding appeals based on status (permanent resident) is therefore not directly applicable.",
      "The court found that section 64(1) of the IRPA, read in conjunction with section 64(2), does not require the IAD to make its own determination on the individual’s status. The question of status is addressed elsewhere in the IRPA (section 63). Section 64(1) is solely concerned with whether a finding of inadmissibility has already been made.",
      "The court reasoned that if Parliament had intended to allow a *de novo* appeal regarding the grounds of inadmissibility, it would have used clearer language in the IRPA. The absence of such language indicates an intention to limit the IAD’s role to cases where no prior finding of inadmissibility exists."
