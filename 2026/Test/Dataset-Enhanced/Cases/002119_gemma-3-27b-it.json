    "[1]\nShore, J.\n: As stated by this Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 118: [1] When applying the standard of reasonableness, a court must\nshow deference to the reasoning of a decision under review and must be cognizant of the fact that certain questions before administrative entities and tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific result\n. As the Supreme Court of Canada explained, reasonableness is concerned with \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\", as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47). [Emphasis added].\nII.\nJudicial Procedure",
    "[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review, pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [\nIRPA\n], of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [Board], rendered on October 17, 2011, wherein it was determined that the Applicants were not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the\nIRPA\n.\nIII.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe Applicants, J.R.G and C.I.V.C., aged respectively 33 and 29 years old, are citizens of Mexico and resided in Mexico D.F.",
    "[4]\nThey alleged to be homosexuals and common-law partners. The principal Applicant, C.I.V.C., worked as a reporter for a social events magazine in Mexico. In August 2009, he mistakenly took pictures of a large house, thinking it was that of a well-known star. On September 4, 2009, after his partner picked him up at work, they were stopped by two vans and taken by armed occupants, who were members of the Beltran Leyva cartel [B.L.C.]. The B.L.C members beat them and raped them, asking for the pictures taken of their (B.L.C.) boss's residence.",
    "[5]\nThe Applicants attempted to report the incident without success. They hid at a relative's residence in Cuernavaca, Morelos. After being traced by the B.L.C members, they returned to Mexico and fled to San Francisco, U.S., on October 7, 2009.",
    "[6]\nAlmost ten months later, without having had requested refugee protection in the U.S., the Applicants returned to Mexico on August 3, 2010, subsequently, after hearing on the news that the head of the B.L.C had been killed by the authorities.",
    "[7]\nThe Applicants alleged that, nevertheless, they still received death threats from the B.L.C members. On August 23, 2010, J.R.G. flew to Canada where he claimed refugee protection. The principal Applicant, C.I.V.C., still harassed by the B.L.C members, flew to the U.S., on December 7, 2010, and later crossed the Canadian border, where he claimed refugee protection on December 20, 2010.\nIV.\nDecision under Review",
    "[8]\nThe Board concluded that, as the claim was based on criminality and as the Applicants were not targeted because of their homosexuality, there was no nexus to any of the Convention grounds.",
    "[9]\nThe Board further found that the Applicants' story was not credible because of its lack of plausibility. The Board found that it was not reasonable that the Applicants did not give the pictures to the B.L.C. members when demanded by them.\nThe Board found that it was not credible that the B.L.C.\nmembers would have conducted a long harassment campaign instead of confronting the Applicants directly, personally and without delay. With respect to the oral testimony related specifically to the taking of the pictures, the Board found it not credible that the B.L.C. members did not confront the principal Applicant the same day.",
    "[10]\nThe Board found that the Applicants' decision to leave the U.S. and return to Mexico brought into question their subjective fear. The Board also drew a negative inference from the fact that the Applicants had not claimed refugee protection in the U.S. The Board underlined the fact that the Applicants had obtained Canadian visas in September 2009, before any alleged kidnapping had taken place\n. The Board also noted that the Applicants' relatives in Mexico had not been approached by the persecutors.",
    "[11]\nWith regard to state protection, the Board noted that the Applicants had not taken further action to access state protection once they were discouraged from doing so at the police station.",
    "[12]\nAfter reviewing the documentary evidence in light of the case law, the Board noted that the Mexican government takes a variety of measures against criminal organizations. The Board found, furthermore, that Mexico has taken action against sexual orientation discrimination.",
    "[13]\nFinally, the Board addressed the Applicants' argument that the Board is biased and is statistically more likely to reject Mexican claims. The Board analyzed the case law as to its record in respect of Mexican claimants to reach its conclusion in that regard.\nV.\nIssue",
    "[14]\nIs the Board's decision reasonable?\nVI.\nRelevant Legislative Provisions",
    "[15]\nThe following legislative provisions of the\nIRPA\nare relevant:\nRefugee Convention\n96.\nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(\nhas\n) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(\nb\n) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in need of protection\n97.\n(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(\nhas\n) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(\nb\n) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nDefinition of refugee \n96.\nA refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\nhas\n) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\nPerson to protect\n97.\n(1) As a person to be protected, a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he does not have a nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\nhas\n) or at risk, if there are serious grounds to believe so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\nPerson to protect\n(2) A person who is in Canada and is part of a category of persons to whom the need for protection is recognized by regulation is also a person to be protected.\nVII.\nPosition of the parties",
    "[16]\nThe Applicants submit that the Board erred when it found no nexus to a Convention ground. The Applicants argue that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation. They further submit that the credibility findings were erroneous and that the Board ignored relevant evidence such as a medical letter and medical prescription corroborating their allegation of rape, as well as photographs, a report from a clinical counsellor in Toronto and contemporaneous e-mails. With respect to state protection, the Applicants sustain that the Board's analysis did not focus on the treatment of journalists in Mexico, nor did it analyze the effective protection of the bodies cited.",
    "[17]\nThe Respondent submits that the claim was based, not on the Applicants' sexual orientation, but on the fact that they were targeted in Mexico;\nin addition, the negative credibility findings were based on the distinct discrepancies noted by the Board\n. The Respondent argues that the determinative issues before the Board were based on credibility and state protection. The Respondent maintains that the Board's failure to discuss the medical letter and the note from a psychologist does not constitute a reviewable error as that evidence does not demonstrate the Applicants' contact with the B.L.C members, nor the fact that they were ever targeted by the B.L.C.; in that regard, the Respondent also points to other elements of the Applicants' claim that the Board held in question as discussed above. The Respondent further specifies that the Board's state protection analysis was rendered as an alternative to its findings on credibility and that analysis is reasonable.\nVIII.\nAnalysis",
    "[18]\nIt is trite law that the Board's conclusions with respect to credibility and state protection should be given deference since they rest on assessments of fact. The appropriate standard of review is reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[19]\nThis Court notes that the present case was based on criminality and not on sexual orientation as it appears from the oral evidence: the Applicants clearly expressed their fear of the B.L.C members (Tribunal Record [TR] at p 517) as a result of taking the pictures. Even after it found no nexus to a Convention ground, the Board analyzed state protection in Mexico with respect to the treatment of homosexuals. Not only did the Board not ignore evidence but it scrutinized the situation as to protection of homosexuals in Mexico (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[20]\nThis Court most strongly disapproves of the use of the word \"opportunity\n\" (used by the Board at para 6 of its Decision) to describe a rape; however, that does not vitiate the Board's decision due to its state protection determination in addition to its lack of credibility finding; yet, the lack of sensitivity in the choice of the word used can neither be overlooked, nor left unsaid; it must be signalled as an inappropriate use of language.",
    "[21]\nIn the present case, the Board's credibility finding is clearly based on the implausibility of the Applicants' narrative. This Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (FCA), made the following statement that applies to the present case:\n4 There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a\nspecialized tribunal\n, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences?\nAs long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review\n... [Emphasis added]",
    "[22]\nThe Board gave numerous reasons in support of the negative inference it drew from the Applicants' voluntary return to Mexico from the U.S. without claiming refugee protection (Board's Decision at para 12). The Applicants have not demonstrated this to be unreasonable.",
    "[23]\nWith regard to the Board's failure to discuss evidence such as the medical letter, the prescription for treatment of the Applicants' injuries, the photographs and the report from the clinical counsellor in Toronto, this Court notes the Board's conclusion on credibility: [15] [...] The Panel, consequently, does not find a ring of truth in the crucial elements of\ntheir story that cover their contacts with Beltran Leyva people and their targeting by this group\n. The Panel, therefore, does not find, on a balance of probabilities, their fear to be well-founded. [Emphasis added].",
    "[24]\nThe Board did make an allusion to a blanket with a threatening message (Board's Decision at para 9) but did not mention the medical letter, the prescription or the counsellor's report. Although the Board could have been more clear in its citing of the evidence, that would not have changed the conclusion as to the lack of credibility therein. A reading of the Board's decision reveals that the evidence clearly does not contradict its conclusion in regard to plausibility.",
    "[25]\nFurthermore, the Board conducted an alternative analysis on state protection. This Court has stated that the availability of state protection is a determinative issue (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis).",
    "[26]\nIn the present case, the Board conducted an extensive review of the documentary evidence before coming to its conclusion on state protection. The Board did not err in law in assessing this issue. Furthermore, its analysis was conducted despite the negative credibility finding and in light of the particular context of the case. Indeed, the Board fully considered the sexual orientation of the Applicants as well as the fact that the principal Applicant worked for a magazine. It was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the principal Applicant, because of the nature of his work, did not have the profile of a reporter targeted by criminal organizations (Board's Decision at para 25).",
    "[27]\nThe Applicants essentially propose that this Court have a different point of view on the documentary evidence assessed by the Board. In the present case, as per the above reasoning, this is not a proper ground for judicial review and the intervention of this Court is unwarranted.\nIX.\nConclusion",
    "[28]\nFor all of the above reasons, the Applicants' application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[29]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that\nthe application for judicial review be dismissed. No question of general importance for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 118:"

Comme l'a expliqué la Cour suprême du Canada, le caractère raisonnable d'une décision tient  à la justification de la décision, à la transparence et à l'intelligibilité du processus décisionnel  ainsi qu'à  l'appartenance de la décision aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit  (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 47). [Non souligné dans l'original.]\nII.\nLa procédure judiciaire\n[2]\nIl s'agit d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire fondée sur le paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés,\nLC 2001, c 27 [la LIPR], visant une décision rendue le 17 octobre 2011 par la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié [la Commission], selon laquelle les demandeurs n'avaient ni qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne à protéger selon les articles 96 et 97 de la LIPR.\nIII.\nLes faits à l'origine du litige\n[3]\nLes demandeurs, J.R.G et C.I.V.C., qui sont âgés respectivement de 33 et de 29 ans, sont des citoyens du Mexique qui habitaient à Mexico.\n[4]\nIls ont allégué être des conjoints de fait homosexuels. Le demandeur principal, C.I.V.C., travaillait comme reporter au Mexique pour un magazine couvrant les événements mondains. En août 2009, il a pris par inadvertance des photographies d'une grande maison, croyant qu'il s'agissait de celle d'une vedette bien connue. Le 4 septembre 2009, son conjoint est allé le chercher au travail, puis ils ont été arrêtés par deux camionnettes et enlevés par les occupants armés de celle-ci, des membres du cartel Beltran Leyva [le C.B.L.]. Les membres du C.B.L. les ont battus et violés et ont demandé les photographies de la résidence de leur patron qui avaient été prises.\n[5]\nLes demandeurs ont tenté de signaler l'incident, sans succès. Ils se sont cachés chez un membre de leur famille à Cuernavaca, dans l'État de Morelos. Après avoir été retrouvés par les membres du C.B.L., ils sont retournés à Mexico et se sont enfuis à San Francisco (États-Unis) le 7 octobre 2009.\n[6]\nPrès de dix mois plus tard, le 3 août 2010, les demandeurs sont retournés au Mexique sans avoir demandé l'asile aux États-Unis, après avoir entendu aux nouvelles que la tête dirigeante du C.B.L. avait été tuée par les autorités.\n[7]\nLes demandeurs ont allégué qu'ils avaient néanmoins reçu des menaces de mort des membres du C.B.L. Le 23 août 2010, J.R.G. s'est enfui au Canada, où il a demandé l'asile. Le demandeur principal, C.I.V.C., qui était toujours harcelé par les membres du C.B.L., s'est enfui auxÉtats-Unis le 7 décembre 2010, puis a franchi la frontière du Canada, où il a demandé l'asile le 20 décembre 2010.\nIV.\nLa décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle\n[8]\nLa Commission a conclu que, étant donné que la demande d'asile était fondée sur la criminalité et que les demandeurs n'avaient pas été pris pour cible en raison de leur homosexualité, il n'y avait aucun lien avec l'un ou l'autre des motifs prévus par la Convention.\n[9]\nLa Commission a également conclu que le récit des demandeurs n'était pas crédible parce qu'il manquait de vraisemblance. De l'avis de la Commission, il n'était pas raisonnable que les demandeurs n'aient pas remis les photographies aux membres du C.B.L. lorsque ceux-ci en ont fait la demande.\nLa Commission a conclu qu'il n'était pas crédible que les membres du C.B.L.\naient mené une longue campagne de harcèlement plutôt que de confronter les demandeurs directement, personnellement et sans délai. En ce qui concerne le témoignage portant explicitement sur la prise des photographies, la Commission a jugé qu'il n'était pas crédible que les membres du C.B.L. n'aient pas confronté le demandeur principal le jour même.\n[10]\nSelon la Commission, la décision des demandeurs de quitter les États-Unis et de retourner au Mexique jetait des doutes sur leur crainte subjective. De plus, la Commission a tiré une conclusion défavorable du fait que les demandeurs n'avaient pas demandé l'asile aux États-Unis. Elle a souligné que les demandeurs avaient obtenu des visas canadiens en septembre 2009, avant le présumé enlèvement.\nElle a ajouté que les membres de la famille des demandeurs vivant au Mexique n'avaient pas été approchés par les persécuteurs.\n[11]\nEn ce qui concerne la protection de l'État, la Commission a souligné que les demandeurs n'avaient pas tenté à nouveau d'obtenir cette protection après avoir été dissuadés de le faire au poste de police.\n[12]\nAprès avoir examiné la preuve documentaire à la lumière de la jurisprudence, la Commission a fait remarquer que le gouvernement mexicain prenait une panoplie de mesures à l'encontre des organisations criminelles. Elle a ajouté que le Mexique avait aussi pris des mesures pour lutter contre la discrimination fondée sur l'orientation sexuelle.\n[13]\nEnfin, la Commission s'est attardée à la prétention des demandeurs selon laquelle elle était partiale et avait davantage tendance, d'après les statistiques, à rejeter les demandes d'asile des Mexicains. Elle a analysé les décisions qu'elle a rendues à l'endroit de demandeurs d'asile mexicains pour arriver à sa conclusion à cet égard.\nV.\nLa question à trancher\n[14]\nLa décision de la Commission est-elle raisonnable?\nVI.\nLes dispositions législatives pertinentes\n[15]\nLes dispositions législatives suivantes de la LIPR sont pertinentes:\nDéfinition de  réfugié \n96.\nA qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\na\n) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\nb) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.\nPersonne à protéger\n97.\n(1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:\na\n) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;\nb) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:\n(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,\n(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,\n(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,\n(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.\nPersonne à protéger\n(2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection.\nConvention refugee\n96.\nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(\na\n) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(\nb\n) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in need of protection\n97.\n(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(\na\n) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(\nb\n) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nVII.\nLes thèses des parties\n[16]\nLes demandeurs reprochent à la Commission d'avoir commis une erreur en concluant à l'absence de lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention. Ils font valoir qu'ils ont été pris pour cible en raison de leur orientation sexuelle. Ils ajoutent que les conclusions relatives à la crédibilité étaient erronées et que la Commission a omis de tenir compte d'éléments de preuve pertinents, notamment une lettre d'un médecin et une ordonnance médicale corroborant leur allégation de viol, des photographies, un rapport d'un conseiller clinique de Toronto et des courriels contemporains. En ce qui a trait à la protection de l'État, les demandeurs affirment que la Commission n'a pas tenu compte dans son analyse du traitement des journalistes au Mexique et n'a pas examiné la protection effectivement offerte par les organismes mentionnés.\n[17]\nPour sa part, le défendeur soutient que la demande d'asile était fondée, non pas sur l'orientation sexuelle des demandeurs, mais sur le fait qu'ils avaient été pris pour cible au Mexique;\nde plus, les conclusions défavorables au sujet de la crédibilité reposaient sur les incohérences relevées par la Commission\n. Selon le défendeur, les questions déterminantes dont la Commission était saisie concernaient la crédibilité et la protection de l'État. Le défendeur affirme que le défaut de la Commission d'analyser la lettre du médecin et la note d'un psychologue ne constitue pas une erreur susceptible de contrôle parce que cette preuve n'établit pas le contact que les demandeurs auraient eu avec les membres du C.B.L., ni le fait qu'ils auraient été la cible de celui-ci; à cet égard, le défendeur mentionne aussi d'autres éléments de la demande d'asile des demandeurs qui ont suscité des doutes dans l'esprit de la Commission et dont il est question plus haut. Il précise en outre que l'analyse de la protection de l'État faite par la Commission était subsidiaire à ses conclusions concernant la crédibilité et que cette analyse est raisonnable.\nVIII.\nAnalyse\n[18]\nIl est bien admis en droit qu'il y a lieu de faire preuve de déférence à l'égard des conclusions de la Commission concernant la crédibilité et la protection de l'État parce que ces conclusions reposent sur une appréciation des faits. La norme de contrôle applicable est celle de la raisonnabilité (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[19]\nLa Cour souligne que la présente affaire était fondée sur la criminalité et non sur l'orientation sexuelle comme le montrent les témoignages. Les demandeurs ont exprimé clairement la crainte que leur inspiraient les membres du C.B.L. (dossier du Tribunal [DT], à la page 517) par suite des photographies qui ont été prises. Même après avoir conclu à l'absence de lien avec un motif prévu par la Convention, la Commission a analysé la protection offerte par l'État au Mexique en ce qui a trait au traitement des homosexuels. Non seulement n'a-t-elle pas omis de tenir compte de certains éléments de preuve, mais elle a analysé à la loupe la situation concernant la protection des homosexuels au Mexique (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[20]\nLa Cour déplore vivement l'emploi des mots  acte opportuniste \n(au paragraphe 6 de la décision de la Commission) pour décrire un viol. Cependant, l'emploi de ces mots n'a pas pour effet de vicier la décision de la Commission vu ses conclusions sur la protection de l'État et sur le manque de crédibilité; malgré tout, le manque de sensibilité dont témoigne l'utilisation des mots en question ne peut être négligé, ni passé sous silence; il faut signaler qu'il s'agit d'un choix de mots inapproprié.\n[21]\nDans la présente affaire, la conclusion de la Commission au sujet de la crédibilité est clairement fondée sur l'invraisemblance de l'exposé circonstancié des demandeurs.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (CAF), la Cour fédérale a formulé les remarques suivantes qui s'appliquent en l'espèce:\n4 Il ne fait pas de doute que le\ntribunal spécialisé\nqu'est la section du statut de réfugié a pleine compétence pour apprécier la plausibilité d'un témoignage. Qui, en effet, mieux que lui, est en mesure de jauger la crédibilité d'un récit et de tirer les inférences qui s'imposent?\nDans la mesure où les inférences que le tribunal tire ne sont pas déraisonnables au point d'attirer notre intervention, ses conclusions sont à l'abri du contrôle judiciaire\n[...] [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[22]\nLa Commission a invoqué de nombreux motifs à l'appui de la conclusion défavorable qu'elle a tirée du fait que les demandeurs sont retournés volontairement au Mexique après être allés aux États-Unis sans y demander l'asile (décision de la Commission, au paragraphe 12). Les demandeurs n'ont pas démontré que cette conclusion n'était pas raisonnable.\n[23]\nEn ce qui concerne le fait que la Commission n'a pas analysé certains éléments de preuve comme la lettre d'un médecin, l'ordonnance relative au traitement des blessures des demandeurs, les photographies et le rapport du conseiller clinique de Toronto, la Cour cite la conclusion suivante que la Commission a tirée au sujet de la crédibilité:\n[15] [...] Ainsi, le tribunal juge que les éléments essentiels de\nleur récit concernant leurs contacts avec les membres de Beltran Leyva et le fait qu'ils ont été pris pour cible par ce groupe\nne sont aucunement vrais. Il conclut donc que, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, leur crainte n'est pas fondée. [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n[24]\nLa Commission a fait allusion à une couverture comportant un message menaçant (décision de la Commission, au paragraphe 9), mais n'a pas mentionné la lettre d'un médecin, l'ordonnance ou le rapport du conseiller. Même si la Commission aurait pu décrire plus clairement les éléments de preuve, cela n'aurait pas changé la conclusion quant au manque de crédibilité de cette preuve. Une lecture de la décision de la Commission montre que la preuve ne va clairement pas à l'encontre de sa conclusion au sujet de la vraisemblance.\n[25]\nPar ailleurs, la Commission a effectué une analyse subsidiaire de la protection de l'État. La Cour fédérale a déjà affirmé que la possibilité d'obtenir la protection de l'État est une question déterminante (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis).\n[26]\nEn l'espèce, la Commission a examiné en profondeur la preuve documentaire avant d'arriver à sa conclusion au sujet de la protection de l'État et n'a pas commis d'erreur de droit à cet égard. De plus, elle a procédé à son analyse malgré sa conclusion défavorable concernant la crédibilité et a tenu compte du contexte particulier de la présente affaire. En effet, elle a pleinement tenu compte de la question de l'orientation sexuelle des demandeurs ainsi que du fait que le demandeur principal travaillait pour un magazine. Il était raisonnable qu'elle conclue que, vu la nature de son travail, le demandeur principal n'avait pas le profil d'un journaliste ciblé par des organisations criminelles (décision de la Commission, au paragraphe 25).\n[27]\nLes demandeurs demandent essentiellement à la Cour d'avoir un point de vue différent au sujet de la preuve documentaire appréciée par la Commission. En l'espèce, d'après le raisonnement exposé ci-dessus, il ne s'agit pas d'un motif valable aux fins d'un contrôle judiciaire et l'intervention de la Cour n'est pas justifiée.\nIX.\nConclusion\n[28]\nPour tous les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande de contrôle judiciaire des demandeurs est rejetée.\nJUGEMENT\n[29]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire soit rejetée. Il n'y a aucune question de portée générale à certifier.\n[End of document]",

As the Supreme Court of Canada explained, reasonableness is concerned with \"the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\", as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 47). [Emphasis added].\nII.\nJudicial Procedure\n\n[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review, pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [\nIRPA\n], of a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [Board], rendered on October 17, 2011, wherein it was determined that the Applicants were not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the\nIRPA\n.\nIII.\nBackground\n\n[3]\nThe Applicants, J.R.G and C.I.V.C., aged respectively 33 and 29 years old, are citizens of Mexico and resided in Mexico D.F.\n\n[4]\nThey alleged to be homosexuals and common-law partners. The principal Applicant, C.I.V.C., worked as a reporter for a social events magazine in Mexico. In August 2009, he mistakenly took pictures of a large house, thinking it was that of a well-known star. On September 4, 2009, after his partner picked him up at work, they were stopped by two vans and taken by armed occupants, who were members of the Beltran Leyva cartel [B.L.C.]. The B.L.C members beat them and raped them, asking for the pictures taken of their (B.L.C.) boss's residence.\n\n[5]\nThe Applicants attempted to report the incident without success. They hid at a relative's residence in Cuernavaca, Morelos. After being traced by the B.L.C members, they returned to Mexico and fled to San Francisco, U.S., on October 7, 2009.\n\n[6]\nAlmost ten months later, without having had requested refugee protection in the U.S., the Applicants returned to Mexico on August 3, 2010, subsequently, after hearing on the news that the head of the B.L.C had been killed by the authorities.\n\n[7]\nThe Applicants alleged that, nevertheless, they still received death threats from the B.L.C members. On August 23, 2010, J.R.G. flew to Canada where he claimed refugee protection. The principal Applicant, C.I.V.C., still harassed by the B.L.C members, flew to the U.S., on December 7, 2010, and later crossed the Canadian border, where he claimed refugee protection on December 20, 2010.\nIV.\nDecision under Review\n\n[8]\nThe Board concluded that, as the claim was based on criminality and as the Applicants were not targeted because of their homosexuality, there was no nexus to any of the Convention grounds.\n\n[9]\nThe Board further found that the Applicants' story was not credible because of its lack of plausibility. The Board found that it was not reasonable that the Applicants did not give the pictures to the B.L.C. members when demanded by them.\nThe Board found that it was not credible that the B.L.C.\nmembers would have conducted a long harassment campaign instead of confronting the Applicants directly, personally and without delay. With respect to the oral testimony related specifically to the taking of the pictures, the Board found it not credible that the B.L.C. members did not confront the principal Applicant the same day.\n\n[10]\nThe Board found that the Applicants' decision to leave the U.S. and return to Mexico brought into question their subjective fear. The Board also drew a negative inference from the fact that the Applicants had not claimed refugee protection in the U.S. The Board underlined the fact that the Applicants had obtained Canadian visas in September 2009, before any alleged kidnapping had taken place\n. The Board also noted that the Applicants' relatives in Mexico had not been approached by the persecutors.\n\n[11]\nWith regard to state protection, the Board noted that the Applicants had not taken further action to access state protection once they were discouraged from doing so at the police station.\n\n[12]\nAfter reviewing the documentary evidence in light of the case law, the Board noted that the Mexican government takes a variety of measures against criminal organizations. The Board found, furthermore, that Mexico has taken action against sexual orientation discrimination.\n\n[13]\nFinally, the Board addressed the Applicants' argument that the Board is biased and is statistically more likely to reject Mexican claims. The Board analyzed the case law as to its record in respect of Mexican claimants to reach its conclusion in that regard.\nV.\nIssue\n\n[14]\nIs the Board's decision reasonable?\nVI.\nRelevant Legislative Provisions\n\n[15]\nThe following legislative provisions of the\nIRPA\nare relevant:\nRefugee Convention\n96.\nA Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(\nhas\n) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(\nb\n) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in need of protection\n97.\n(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(\nhas\n) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(\nb\n) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nPerson in need of protection\n(2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.\nDefinition of refugee \n96.\nA refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\nhas\n) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\nPerson to protect\n97.\n(1) As a person to be protected, a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he does not have a nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\nhas\n) or at risk, if there are serious grounds to believe so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\nPerson to protect\n(2) A person who is in Canada and is part of a category of persons to whom the need for protection is recognized by regulation is also a person to be protected.\nVII.\nPosition of the parties\n\n[16]\nThe Applicants submit that the Board erred when it found no nexus to a Convention ground. The Applicants argue that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation. They further submit that the credibility findings were erroneous and that the Board ignored relevant evidence such as a medical letter and medical prescription corroborating their allegation of rape, as well as photographs, a report from a clinical counsellor in Toronto and contemporaneous e-mails. With respect to state protection, the Applicants sustain that the Board's analysis did not focus on the treatment of journalists in Mexico, nor did it analyze the effective protection of the bodies cited.\n\n[17]\nThe Respondent submits that the claim was based, not on the Applicants' sexual orientation, but on the fact that they were targeted in Mexico;\nin addition, the negative credibility findings were based on the distinct discrepancies noted by the Board\n. The Respondent argues that the determinative issues before the Board were based on credibility and state protection. The Respondent maintains that the Board's failure to discuss the medical letter and the note from a psychologist does not constitute a reviewable error as that evidence does not demonstrate the Applicants' contact with the B.L.C members, nor the fact that they were ever targeted by the B.L.C.; in that regard, the Respondent also points to other elements of the Applicants' claim that the Board held in question as discussed above. The Respondent further specifies that the Board's state protection analysis was rendered as an alternative to its findings on credibility and that analysis is reasonable.\nVIII.\nAnalysis\n\n[18]\nIt is trite law that the Board's conclusions with respect to credibility and state protection should be given deference since they rest on assessments of fact. The appropriate standard of review is reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[19]\nThis Court notes that the present case was based on criminality and not on sexual orientation as it appears from the oral evidence: the Applicants clearly expressed their fear of the B.L.C members (Tribunal Record [TR] at p 517) as a result of taking the pictures. Even after it found no nexus to a Convention ground, the Board analyzed state protection in Mexico with respect to the treatment of homosexuals. Not only did the Board not ignore evidence but it scrutinized the situation as to protection of homosexuals in Mexico (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[20]\nThis Court most strongly disapproves of the use of the word \"opportunity\n\" (used by the Board at para 6 of its Decision) to describe a rape; however, that does not vitiate the Board's decision due to its state protection determination in addition to its lack of credibility finding; yet, the lack of sensitivity in the choice of the word used can neither be overlooked, nor left unsaid; it must be signalled as an inappropriate use of language.\n\n[21]\nIn the present case, the Board's credibility finding is clearly based on the implausibility of the Applicants' narrative. This Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis) (FCA), made the following statement that applies to the present case:\n4 There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a\nspecialized tribunal\n, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences?\nAs long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review\n... [Emphasis added]\n\n[22]\nThe Board gave numerous reasons in support of the negative inference it drew from the Applicants' voluntary return to Mexico from the U.S. without claiming refugee protection (Board's Decision at para 12). The Applicants have not demonstrated this to be unreasonable.\n\n[23]\nWith regard to the Board's failure to discuss evidence such as the medical letter, the prescription for treatment of the Applicants' injuries, the photographs and the report from the clinical counsellor in Toronto, this Court notes the Board's conclusion on credibility: [15] [...] The Panel, consequently, does not find a ring of truth in the crucial elements of\ntheir story that cover their contacts with Beltran Leyva people and their targeting by this group\n. The Panel, therefore, does not find, on a balance of probabilities, their fear to be well-founded. [Emphasis added].\n\n[24]\nThe Board did make an allusion to a blanket with a threatening message (Board's Decision at para 9) but did not mention the medical letter, the prescription or the counsellor's report. Although the Board could have been more clear in its citing of the evidence, that would not have changed the conclusion as to the lack of credibility therein. A reading of the Board's decision reveals that the evidence clearly does not contradict its conclusion in regard to plausibility.\n\n[25]\nFurthermore, the Board conducted an alternative analysis on state protection. This Court has stated that the availability of state protection is a determinative issue (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL/Lexis).\n\n[26]\nIn the present case, the Board conducted an extensive review of the documentary evidence before coming to its conclusion on state protection. The Board did not err in law in assessing this issue. Furthermore, its analysis was conducted despite the negative credibility finding and in light of the particular context of the case. Indeed, the Board fully considered the sexual orientation of the Applicants as well as the fact that the principal Applicant worked for a magazine. It was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the principal Applicant, because of the nature of his work, did not have the profile of a reporter targeted by criminal organizations (Board's Decision at para 25).\n\n[27]\nThe Applicants essentially propose that this Court have a different point of view on the documentary evidence assessed by the Board. In the present case, as per the above reasoning, this is not a proper ground for judicial review and the intervention of this Court is unwarranted.\nIX.\nConclusion\n\n[28]\nFor all of the above reasons, the Applicants' application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[29]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that\nthe application for judicial review be dismissed. No question of general importance for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 118:",

        "The Board's state protection analysis was reasonable, conducted as an alternative to its credibility findings.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed the Refugee Protection Division’s (Board) decision denying the applicants’ claim for refugee status, finding the decision reasonable under the standard of review for reasonableness.",
      "The court emphasized that the Board’s credibility assessments and state protection analysis are entitled to deference as they involve factual assessments.",
      "The court found the Board’s negative credibility assessment was based on the implausibility of the applicants’ narrative, specifically their account of the events surrounding the taking of photographs and the subsequent interactions with the Beltran Leyva cartel (B.L.C.). The Board found it unreasonable that the applicants wouldn't have surrendered the photos when demanded and questioned the lack of immediate confrontation by the B.L.C.",
      "The Board’s finding that the applicants’ voluntary return to Mexico from the U.S. without seeking refugee protection there was a reasonable basis for a negative inference, and the applicants did not demonstrate this to be unreasonable.",
      "The court acknowledged the Board’s alternative analysis of state protection in Mexico, noting that the Board considered the treatment of homosexuals and journalists, and reasonably concluded the principal applicant’s profession did not make him a typical target for criminal organizations.",
      "The court determined that the Board’s failure to explicitly address certain pieces of evidence (medical letter, prescription, counsellor’s report) did not invalidate its decision, as the evidence did not fundamentally contradict the overall finding of a lack of credibility and plausibility.",
      "The court clarified that while disapproving of the Board’s insensitive language (“opportunity” to describe a rape), this did not affect the overall reasonableness of the decision, given the independent basis for the denial based on credibility and state protection.",
      "The court applied established legal principles regarding the standard of review for administrative tribunals, deferring to the Board’s expertise in assessing credibility and factual matters, intervening only if the Board’s inferences were unreasonable."
