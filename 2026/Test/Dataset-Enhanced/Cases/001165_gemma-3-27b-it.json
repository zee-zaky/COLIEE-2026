    "[1]\nRouleau, J.\n: The following are the written reasons referred to in my order of May 10, 1991, wherein I denied the applicant's motion for an interlocutory injunction.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant, a member of the Refugee Backlog Program, is a native of Trinidad where her two children, age eight, still reside; she arrived in Canada on a three month visitor's visa on September 18, 1988. At the \"humanitarian and compassionate\" interview September 25, 1990, it was determined that there was no basis to recommend an exemption under s. 114(2) of the\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended; an application for leave to have this reviewed under s. 18 was refused by Mr. Justice Teitelbaum December 31, 1990. The applicant has yet to proceed to the next stage, the credible basis hearing. It has been adjourned from time to time since December 20, 1990. On January 8, 1991, the tribunal made a preliminary determination that it had jurisdiction under s. 52 of the\nConstitution Act\nto make a finding with respect to the constitutional questions raised, but that these matters would only be dealt with at the conclusion of the credible basis inquiry.",
    "[3]\nThe applicant now brings this application for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the respondent from proceeding with her credible basis hearing pending the outcome of the trial of this action, in which she argues that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in the tribunal, and claims that her rights under ss. 7 and 12 of the\nCharter\nhave been infringed due to unreasonable delay in processing her claim.",
    "[4]\nBefore dealing with the issues pertaining to the granting of an interlocutory injunction, I feel compelled to point out that the applicant has raised a number of matters with respect to the general procedure being followed by adjudicators. They are, to my mind, complaints rather than issues that should be dealt with in a court of law. It is not appropriate to bring before this court generic complaints regarding the entire refugee backlog system in the absence of factual background outlining specific procedural complaints and seeking specific relief. May I add, adjudicators are \"masters of their own house\", and may choose to conduct their proceedings as they see fit. If they choose to deal with the constitutional questions at the conclusion of the inquiry, refuse to join claims, and so on, such matters are not relevant to this application. If, subsequent to the hearing, concerns as to the fairness of the process arise, they may properly be the subject of an application for judicial review.",
    "[5]\nIn order to grant an interlocutory injunction, the applicant must show that there is a\nserious issue\nto be tried, that\nirreparable harm\nwill result if the order is not granted and that the\nbalance of convenience\nlies in her favour (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 123 (F.C.A.)).",
    "[6]\nIt is trite law that the merits of an action are not to be determined on an interlocutory motion (\nAmerican Cyanamid\n, [1975] 1 All E.R. 504;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  outset of the hearing of this application I indicated to counsel that I was willing, based on my review of the written submissions, to accept that there was a serious issue to be tried; argument therefore was directed primarily to the question of irreparable harm and the balance of convenience.",
    "[7]\nBriefly, counsel argued that the delay in processing an application for Convention Refugee status has violated her right to security of the person under s. 7 of the\nCharter\nand subjected her to cruel and unusual treatment contrary to s. 12; the delay subjects her to mental anguish regarding her status, as well as impairing her ability to establish a credible basis for her claim. The majority of the evidence submitted in this application was to the effect that refugee claimants in general whose claims have been delayed suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder; as well, their memories are impaired. Given that I am not to determine the merits of the action at this stage, I decline to comment on this evidence; it will be assessed at trial.",
    "[8]\nAlthough the respondents submitted that there was no serious delay in the particular case at hand, nevertheless as I indicated, I am prepared to accept for purposes of this motion that a\nCharter\nchallenge based on unreasonable delay, argued by analogy to the right of a criminal accused to trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b), is not a frivolous argument. Jurisprudence was submitted by counsel on both sides of the issue, sufficient to persuade me that it is not a question to be summarily discounted at this preliminary stage.",
    "[9]\nThe second issue raised by the applicant is with respect to the independence and impartiality of the adjudicators. It was submitted that there are several factors giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias: adjudicators are appointed on short-term contracts; procedure on constitutional questions has been predetermined at meetings of adjudicators and yet no policy statements are available in this regard; the adjudicators have been influenced by their superior as to the merits of the constitutional questions; finally, the adjudicators are advised by the same Legal Services Branch as are the Case Presenting Officers.",
    "[10]\nAbsolutely no evidence has been tendered to convince me that because adjudicators are appointed on short-term contracts their independence is somehow adversely affected; it is a theory completely unsupported by facts. As I see it, they are required to take the same oath of office as every other public servant and the\nPublic Service Employment Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-32, is equally applicable to backlog adjudicators. I do not accept that the issue raised in the present case differs significantly from that in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 321, where this same approach was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal. The court in that case had no difficulty with the fact that adjudicators were appointed to other positions on an acting basis, or vice versa. Furthermore, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed an argument of reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of adjudicators whose positions were said to be less than secure. Although that case was primarily decided on the uncertainty of legislative action, the court commented that the Minister had no special interest in any individual case, and no reasonable person would conclude that the Board would attempt to please the government by denying applicants rights afforded them by law.",
    "[11]\nThe fact that adjudicators are advised by the same Legal Services Branch as are the Case Presenting Officers has already been held, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  together only at the apex; and may I also point out that adjudicators have their own legal advisors with whom to consult.",
    "[12]\nI see no difficulty in the adjudicators meeting to determine how they are to proceed on constitutional issues; the evidence, to the contrary, indicates that individual cases are not discussed at such meetings, but only general procedural principles, and adjudicators are encouraged to decide cases independently on the merits. This does not exceed the proper limits of collegial decision-making as set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321; 68 D.L.R.(4th) 524.",
    "[13]\nI am, however, persuaded that the allegations of possible influence of the adjudicators by their superior raises at least an arguable case; the evidence indicates that a memo was circulated to, or at least available to adjudicators, in which the Director of Adjudication indicated that the constitutional arguments on unreasonable delay should not be referred to the Federal Court of Appeal under s. 28(4) of the\nFederal Court Act\n; in her opinion, the issues were without merit and \"a waste of the court's time\". This may influence individual adjudicators in their determination when these same issues are raised by applicants at their credible basis hearings. With all due respect to the opinion expressed by the Director of Adjudication on the constitutional arguments it would seem to me that the most efficient approach, and one which would assist the adjudicators, would be to submit an application before the Federal Court of Appeal with respect to the\nCharter\nchallenges.",
    "[14]\nAlthough the questions raised by the applicant are not entirely frivolous, in the sense that there is at least an arguable case to proceed to trial, I am satisfied that no injunction should issue when one considers the other aspects of the test: irreparable harm and the balance of convenience.",
    "[15]\nThis entire application is premature. No action has yet been taken that can be complained of; no credible basis hearing has been held, no ruling has been made on the constitutional questions by the adjudicator, and no deportation order has issued. It is conceivable that the applicant may succeed at her hearing, and the entire question will then become moot; if she is unsuccessful, recourse may be had through the provisions of the\nAct\nallowing for review. I am satisfied that administrative process should not be disrupted and delayed pending the applicant's challenge. The public interest in having these hearings continue must outweigh any interest of the applicants in having an injunction issue at this stage, particularly when its effect would be to delay the process even further. The statutory scheme, which has not been challenged per se, ought to be enforced until and unless it is held to be invalid. The procedure as set out in the\nImmigration Act\nhas not yet been exhausted; once the hearing has been held, then any complaints which arise can be the subject of an application for judicial review.",
    "[16]\nCounsel submitted that the applicant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction does not issue: if the inquiry proceeds, and it is subsequently determined that\nCharter\nrights had been infringed and it is found that the tribunal is biased, the protection sought will be rendered nugatory (\nRe Kodellas et al. and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission et al.\n(1986), 52 Sask.R. 139; 34 D.L.R.(4th) 30 (Sask. Q.B.)). It was further argued that to be subjected to the process of a hearing could cause the sort of psychological and emotional stress and anxiety which the Supreme Court of Canada has determined to come under the umbrella of protections provided by s. 7 (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 1; 44 D.L.R.(4th) 385). As I see it, prolonging the hearing is more apt to bring about stress and uncertainty than a more expeditious procedure. It was further argued that testimony at such a hearing could affect the Minister's assessment of their claim. This proposition is pure speculation.",
    "[17]\nThe applicant went on that, because the credible basis hearing could result in a deportation order, irreparable harm would result if the credible basis hearing is not stayed pending the outcome of this action. In support of this proposition, the applicant relies upon\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 69 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  bar: the challenge in these proceedings is concerned with a decision not yet reached; the adjudicator will eventually be ruling on the very questions raised in the matter. Subsequent thereto, nothing prevents the applicant from seeking other relief in the event that a deportation order issues and the jurisprudence referred to would support an applicant's position in relevant circumstances.",
    "[18]\nIt was also argued that if an injunction issued, the resolution of the constitutional questions would become preeminent; that a trial could be expedited in order to advance the interests of justice. The nature of the challenge raised would provide the ultimate solution to all concerned. I fail to see in law why this should be considered as grounds for granting an injunction.",
    "[19]\nIn considering the balance of convenience between the parties, the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , wrote that, in order to issue an injunction or stay against a public authority, public interest is of primary concern. The court had the following to say regarding the granting of a stay, at pp. 134-135:\n\"... the granting of a stay requested by the private litigants or by one of them ... generally works in one of two ways. Either the law enforcement agency is enjoined from enforcing the impugned provisions in all respects until the question of their validity has been finally determined, or the law enforcement agency is enjoined from enforcing the impugned provisions with respect to the specific litigant or litigants who request the granting of a stay. In the first branch of the alternative, the operation of the impugned provisions is temporarily suspended for all practical purposes. Instances of this type can perhaps be referred to as suspension cases. In the second branch of the alternative, the litigant who is granted a stay is in fact exempted from the impugned legislation which, in the meanwhile, continues to operate with respect to others. Instances of this other type, I will call exemption cases.\n\"Whether or not they are ultimately held to be constitutional, the law which litigants seek to suspend or from which they seek to be exempted by way of interlocutory injunctive relief have been enacted by democratically-elected legislatures and are generally passed for the common good, ... It seems axiomatic that the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief in most suspension cases, and, up to a point, as will be seen later, in quite a few exemption cases, is susceptible temporarily to frustrate the pursuit of the common good.\"\nAnd at page 146, the court concluded:\n\"It has been seen from what precedes that suspension cases and exemption cases are governed by the same basic rule according to which, in constitutional litigation, an interlocutory stay of proceedings ought not to be granted unless the public interest is taken into consideration in the balance of convenience and weighted together with the interest of private litigants.\n\"The reason why exemption cases are assimilated to suspension cases is the precedential value and exemplary effect of exemption cases. Depending on the nature of the case, to grant an exemption in the form of a stay to one litigant is often to make it difficult to refuse the same remedy to other litigants who find themselves in essentially the same situation, and to risk provoking a cascade of stays and exemptions, the sum of which make them tantamount to a suspension case.\"",
    "[20]\nI find myself in total agreement with the respondents' submission that the granting of an injunction in individual cases would weigh heavily on the entire backlog system. Identical issues could be raised in thousands of outstanding claims and would undoubtedly lead to a complete disruption of the backlog refugee claim proceedings. The scheme was legislated and it is in the public interest that the enforcement of the statutory scheme should prevail. As Mr. Justice MacKay wrote in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)).",
    "[21]\nThe applicant finally submitted that the public interest in the protection of\nCharter\nrights is paramount (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). Although I generally agree with this in principle, I am still persuaded that in these circumstances the applicant's risk of irreparable harm is minimal vis-à-vis the greater harm to the public interest in interfering with the statutory scheme.",
    "[22]\nIt is evident from what I have written that I am convinced beyond any doubt that this application is premature. The adjudicators should be afforded the opportunity to consider the constitutional challenges. Having the appropriate factual background during a credible basis hearing, they are probably in the best position to entertain the constitutional issues raised. The applicant will then be afforded an opportunity to seek further relief should she have been deprived of any principles of fundamental justice.",
    "[23]\nThe defendant raised the question of leave under s. 82.1 of the\nImmigration Act\n, having determined this application as I have, I see no need to deal with this issue.",
    "[24]\nAlthough it is evident that the facts in the\nJames\ncase may not be entirely \"on all fours\" with all applications which I entertained on May 8, 1991, I am nevertheless satisfied that the general principles enunciated here are applicable to all of the cases concerned: T-843-91, T-853-91, T-856-91, T-877-91, T-878-91, T-879-91, T-881-91, T-912-91, T-913-91, T-914-91, T-918-91, T-1094-91, T-1175-91 and T-1176-91.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/nmg\n[End of document]"

The applicant has yet to proceed to the next stage, the credible basis hearing. It has been adjourned from time to time since December 20, 1990. On January 8, 1991, the tribunal made a preliminary determination that it had jurisdiction under s. 52 of the\nConstitution Act\nto make a finding with respect to the constitutional questions raised, but that these matters would only be dealt with at the conclusion of the credible basis inquiry.\n\n[3]\nThe applicant now brings this application for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the respondent from proceeding with her credible basis hearing pending the outcome of the trial of this action, in which she argues that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in the tribunal, and claims that her rights under ss. 7 and 12 of the\nCharter\nhave been infringed due to unreasonable delay in processing her claim.\n\n[4]\nBefore dealing with the issues pertaining to the granting of an interlocutory injunction, I feel compelled to point out that the applicant has raised a number of matters with respect to the general procedure being followed by adjudicators. They are, to my mind, complaints rather than issues that should be dealt with in a court of law. It is not appropriate to bring before this court generic complaints regarding the entire refugee backlog system in the absence of factual background outlining specific procedural complaints and seeking specific relief. May I add, adjudicators are \"masters of their own house\", and may choose to conduct their proceedings as they see fit. If they choose to deal with the constitutional questions at the conclusion of the inquiry, refuse to join claims, and so on, such matters are not relevant to this application. If, subsequent to the hearing, concerns as to the fairness of the process arise, they may properly be the subject of an application for judicial review.\n\n[5]\nIn order to grant an interlocutory injunction, the applicant must show that there is a\nserious issue\nto be tried, that\nirreparable harm\nwill result if the order is not granted and that the\nbalance of convenience\nlies in her favour (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 123 (F.C.A.)).\n\n[6]\nIt is trite law that the merits of an action are not to be determined on an interlocutory motion (\nAmerican Cyanamid\n, [1975] 1 All E.R. 504;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  outset of the hearing of this application I indicated to counsel that I was willing, based on my review of the written submissions, to accept that there was a serious issue to be tried; argument therefore was directed primarily to the question of irreparable harm and the balance of convenience.\n\n[7]\nBriefly, counsel argued that the delay in processing an application for Convention Refugee status has violated her right to security of the person under s. 7 of the\nCharter\nand subjected her to cruel and unusual treatment contrary to s. 12; the delay subjects her to mental anguish regarding her status, as well as impairing her ability to establish a credible basis for her claim. The majority of the evidence submitted in this application was to the effect that refugee claimants in general whose claims have been delayed suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder; as well, their memories are impaired. Given that I am not to determine the merits of the action at this stage, I decline to comment on this evidence; it will be assessed at trial.\n\n[8]\nAlthough the respondents submitted that there was no serious delay in the particular case at hand, nevertheless as I indicated, I am prepared to accept for purposes of this motion that a\nCharter\nchallenge based on unreasonable delay, argued by analogy to the right of a criminal accused to trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b), is not a frivolous argument. Jurisprudence was submitted by counsel on both sides of the issue, sufficient to persuade me that it is not a question to be summarily discounted at this preliminary stage.\n\n[9]\nThe second issue raised by the applicant is with respect to the independence and impartiality of the adjudicators. It was submitted that there are several factors giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias: adjudicators are appointed on short-term contracts; procedure on constitutional questions has been predetermined at meetings of adjudicators and yet no policy statements are available in this regard; the adjudicators have been influenced by their superior as to the merits of the constitutional questions; finally, the adjudicators are advised by the same Legal Services Branch as are the Case Presenting Officers.\n\n[10]\nAbsolutely no evidence has been tendered to convince me that because adjudicators are appointed on short-term contracts their independence is somehow adversely affected; it is a theory completely unsupported by facts. As I see it, they are required to take the same oath of office as every other public servant and the\nPublic Service Employment Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-32, is equally applicable to backlog adjudicators. I do not accept that the issue raised in the present case differs significantly from that in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 321, where this same approach was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal. The court in that case had no difficulty with the fact that adjudicators were appointed to other positions on an acting basis, or vice versa. Furthermore, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed an argument of reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of adjudicators whose positions were said to be less than secure. Although that case was primarily decided on the uncertainty of legislative action, the court commented that the Minister had no special interest in any individual case, and no reasonable person would conclude that the Board would attempt to please the government by denying applicants rights afforded them by law.\n\n[11]\nThe fact that adjudicators are advised by the same Legal Services Branch as are the Case Presenting Officers has already been held, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  together only at the apex; and may I also point out that adjudicators have their own legal advisors with whom to consult.\n\n[12]\nI see no difficulty in the adjudicators meeting to determine how they are to proceed on constitutional issues; the evidence, to the contrary, indicates that individual cases are not discussed at such meetings, but only general procedural principles, and adjudicators are encouraged to decide cases independently on the merits. This does not exceed the proper limits of collegial decision-making as set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 321; 68 D.L.R.(4th) 524.\n\n[13]\nI am, however, persuaded that the allegations of possible influence of the adjudicators by their superior raises at least an arguable case; the evidence indicates that a memo was circulated to, or at least available to adjudicators, in which the Director of Adjudication indicated that the constitutional arguments on unreasonable delay should not be referred to the Federal Court of Appeal under s. 28(4) of the\nFederal Court Act\n; in her opinion, the issues were without merit and \"a waste of the court's time\". This may influence individual adjudicators in their determination when these same issues are raised by applicants at their credible basis hearings. With all due respect to the opinion expressed by the Director of Adjudication on the constitutional arguments it would seem to me that the most efficient approach, and one which would assist the adjudicators, would be to submit an application before the Federal Court of Appeal with respect to the\nCharter\nchallenges.\n\n[14]\nAlthough the questions raised by the applicant are not entirely frivolous, in the sense that there is at least an arguable case to proceed to trial, I am satisfied that no injunction should issue when one considers the other aspects of the test: irreparable harm and the balance of convenience.\n\n[15]\nThis entire application is premature. No action has yet been taken that can be complained of; no credible basis hearing has been held, no ruling has been made on the constitutional questions by the adjudicator, and no deportation order has issued. It is conceivable that the applicant may succeed at her hearing, and the entire question will then become moot; if she is unsuccessful, recourse may be had through the provisions of the\nAct\nallowing for review. I am satisfied that administrative process should not be disrupted and delayed pending the applicant's challenge. The public interest in having these hearings continue must outweigh any interest of the applicants in having an injunction issue at this stage, particularly when its effect would be to delay the process even further. The statutory scheme, which has not been challenged per se, ought to be enforced until and unless it is held to be invalid. The procedure as set out in the\nImmigration Act\nhas not yet been exhausted; once the hearing has been held, then any complaints which arise can be the subject of an application for judicial review.\n\n[16]\nCounsel submitted that the applicant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction does not issue: if the inquiry proceeds, and it is subsequently determined that\nCharter\nrights had been infringed and it is found that the tribunal is biased, the protection sought will be rendered nugatory (\nRe Kodellas et al. and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission et al.\n(1986), 52 Sask.R. 139; 34 D.L.R.(4th) 30 (Sask. Q.B.)). It was further argued that to be subjected to the process of a hearing could cause the sort of psychological and emotional stress and anxiety which the Supreme Court of Canada has determined to come under the umbrella of protections provided by s. 7 (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 1; 44 D.L.R.(4th) 385). As I see it, prolonging the hearing is more apt to bring about stress and uncertainty than a more expeditious procedure. It was further argued that testimony at such a hearing could affect the Minister's assessment of their claim. This proposition is pure speculation.\n\n[17]\nThe applicant went on that, because the credible basis hearing could result in a deportation order, irreparable harm would result if the credible basis hearing is not stayed pending the outcome of this action. In support of this proposition, the applicant relies upon\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 69 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  bar: the challenge in these proceedings is concerned with a decision not yet reached; the adjudicator will eventually be ruling on the very questions raised in the matter. Subsequent thereto, nothing prevents the applicant from seeking other relief in the event that a deportation order issues and the jurisprudence referred to would support an applicant's position in relevant circumstances.\n\n[18]\nIt was also argued that if an injunction issued, the resolution of the constitutional questions would become preeminent; that a trial could be expedited in order to advance the interests of justice. The nature of the challenge raised would provide the ultimate solution to all concerned. I fail to see in law why this should be considered as grounds for granting an injunction.\n\n[19]\nIn considering the balance of convenience between the parties, the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , wrote that, in order to issue an injunction or stay against a public authority, public interest is of primary concern. The court had the following to say regarding the granting of a stay, at pp. 134-135:\n\"... the granting of a stay requested by the private litigants or by one of them ... generally works in one of two ways. Either the law enforcement agency is enjoined from enforcing the impugned provisions in all respects until the question of their validity has been finally determined, or the law enforcement agency is enjoined from enforcing the impugned provisions with respect to the specific litigant or litigants who request the granting of a stay. In the first branch of the alternative, the operation of the impugned provisions is temporarily suspended for all practical purposes. Instances of this type can perhaps be referred to as suspension cases. In the second branch of the alternative, the litigant who is granted a stay is in fact exempted from the impugned legislation which, in the meanwhile, continues to operate with respect to others. Instances of this other type, I will call exemption cases.\n\"Whether or not they are ultimately held to be constitutional, the law which litigants seek to suspend or from which they seek to be exempted by way of interlocutory injunctive relief have been enacted by democratically-elected legislatures and are generally passed for the common good, ... It seems axiomatic that the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief in most suspension cases, and, up to a point, as will be seen later, in quite a few exemption cases, is susceptible temporarily to frustrate the pursuit of the common good.\"\nAnd at page 146, the court concluded:\n\"It has been seen from what precedes that suspension cases and exemption cases are governed by the same basic rule according to which, in constitutional litigation, an interlocutory stay of proceedings ought not to be granted unless the public interest is taken into consideration in the balance of convenience and weighted together with the interest of private litigants.\n\"The reason why exemption cases are assimilated to suspension cases is the precedential value and exemplary effect of exemption cases. Depending on the nature of the case, to grant an exemption in the form of a stay to one litigant is often to make it difficult to refuse the same remedy to other litigants who find themselves in essentially the same situation, and to risk provoking a cascade of stays and exemptions, the sum of which make them tantamount to a suspension case.\"\n\n[20]\nI find myself in total agreement with the respondents' submission that the granting of an injunction in individual cases would weigh heavily on the entire backlog system. Identical issues could be raised in thousands of outstanding claims and would undoubtedly lead to a complete disruption of the backlog refugee claim proceedings. The scheme was legislated and it is in the public interest that the enforcement of the statutory scheme should prevail. As Mr. Justice MacKay wrote in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)).\n\n[21]\nThe applicant finally submitted that the public interest in the protection of\nCharter\nrights is paramount (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)). Although I generally agree with this in principle, I am still persuaded that in these circumstances the applicant's risk of irreparable harm is minimal vis-à-vis the greater harm to the public interest in interfering with the statutory scheme.\n\n[22]\nIt is evident from what I have written that I am convinced beyond any doubt that this application is premature. The adjudicators should be afforded the opportunity to consider the constitutional challenges. Having the appropriate factual background during a credible basis hearing, they are probably in the best position to entertain the constitutional issues raised. The applicant will then be afforded an opportunity to seek further relief should she have been deprived of any principles of fundamental justice.\n\n[23]\nThe defendant raised the question of leave under s. 82.1 of the\nImmigration Act\n, having determined this application as I have, I see no need to deal with this issue.\n\n[24]\nAlthough it is evident that the facts in the\nJames\ncase may not be entirely \"on all fours\" with all applications which I entertained on May 8, 1991, I am nevertheless satisfied that the general principles enunciated here are applicable to all of the cases concerned: T-843-91, T-853-91, T-856-91, T-877-91, T-878-91, T-879-91, T-881-91, T-912-91, T-913-91, T-914-91, T-918-91, T-1094-91, T-1175-91 and T-1176-91.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/nmg\n[End of document]",
