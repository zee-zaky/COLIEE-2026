    "[1]\nMosley, J.\n: The applicants are a family of four, all citizens of Mexico. They fled to Canada and applied for refugee status in 2006, which was denied in October 2007. This application for judicial review is of the finding of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) that they are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.",
    "[2]\nThe claims of the two minor children and the adult male applicant are based on that of the adult female applicant, Ms Flores, who alleges fear of her former common law partner, Enrique. In 1994, aged 14, Ms. Flores began a relationship with Enrique, who became abusive towards her after she announced the following year that she was pregnant. The two minor claimants are her children from that relationship, born in 1996 and 1997.",
    "[3]\nEnrique spent nine months in prison in 1996 and almost five years from 2001 to 2005. In the gap between the two, he threatened the principal applicant and allegedly killed two men with whom she had started relationships. Ms. Flores married the adult male applicant, Mr. Davila, during Enrique's second incarceration. On Enrique's release, he threatened Ms. Flores at her mother's house. She and Mr. Davila went to the police, who refused to take a denunciation.",
    "[4]\nIn December 2005, Mr. Davila was allegedly attacked by two unknown men. He did not require medical attention and the attack was not reported to police. The family relocated within Mexico in February 2006, but was followed by Enrique, with whom Mr. Davila got into a fight in March 2006. They moved again several times within Mexico, apparently always being followed by Enrique. On September 13, 2006, they fled to Canada.",
    "[5]\nThe panel member found that Ms Flores failed to make diligent efforts to seek state protection prior to seeking asylum and thus her family was not in need of Canada's protection. The finding that such protection would be reasonably forthcoming was based largely on legislative and judicial measures to combat domestic violence and measures to assist women who are its victims taken by the Mexican authorities.",
    "[6]\nThe applicants allege that the RPD panel member erred in the assessment of state protection and in ignoring highly relevant evidence without explanation.",
    "[7]\nThe claim that the member ignored evidence which contradicted the decision would mean that the decision was unreasonable according to the statutory guidance of paragraph 18.1(4)(\nd\n) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, R.S., 1985, c. F-7.\nState protection",

      "The court acknowledged the applicants’ argument that adequate protection should be at least minimally effective, but rejected it, citing *Carillo* and the Supreme Court’s emphasis in *Ward* that refugee protection serves as a surrogate for a claimant’s own state’s protection.  In a democratic society like Mexico, a higher standard of evidence is required to rebut the presumption of state protection.",
      "The court found no error in the RPD’s assessment of evidence, specifically rejecting the claim that the panel ignored relevant documents, including an RPD Issue Paper on State Protection in Mexico. The court applied the principle that decision-makers are presumed to have considered all evidence unless there are strong indications to the contrary, and found no such indications here.",
      "The court distinguished this case from a previous case cited by the applicants (*F.T.R. 35*), where Justice Martineau found an error due to a failure to assess the applicant’s personal circumstances.
