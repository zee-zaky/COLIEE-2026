    "[1]\nStrayer, J.\n: This is an action for infringement in respect of Canadian patent 1,081,733 for a \"Pliable Edge Protector\", of which the plaintiff is assignee. The defendant denies infringement in respect of two claims of the patent, and by its defence and counter-claim alleges as well that the patent is invalid. Invalidity is alleged on the basis of: lack of invention, both on the grounds that the subject of the patent was obvious and that it did not represent a new \"combination\" but rather an \"aggregation\" of known devices giving known results; anticipation, by prior use and sale by others in a manner making such product available to the public, by prior publication, and by sale in Canada by the plaintiff of the same product more than two years prior to its application for a patent; and \"covetousness\", i.e., that the claims are broader than the alleged invention described in the disclosures of the patent.\nBackground Facts",
    "[2]\nThe \"Pliable Edge Protector\" in question is largely used for the purpose of protecting car door edges although it may be used on other thin edges on cars, boats, furniture, etc. The principal demand for the type of product in question here, whether made by the plaintiff or the defendant, appears to be in the \"after-market\" in respect of cars: that is, it is sold to private owners of cars for adding to their vehicles, rather than to manufacturers for installation as original equipment.",
    "[3]\nThe claims of patent '733 are as follows:\n\"1. A pliable edge protector comprising:\na) an elongated extruded channelar member formed of pliable material, said extruded channelar member having a bight portion and a pair of spaced-apart flange portions projecting therefrom to form an interior throat therebetween;\nb) a decorative elongated strip of thin material, said decorative elongated strip having two major surfaces and two minor edge surfaces extending along the length of the decorative strip, one of said major surfaces covering the exterior surface of said extruded channelar member and extending over the projecting ends of said flange portions to thereby dispose said minor edge surfaces within said interior throat; and\n\"2. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1, said pliable material being a soft polyvinyl chloride.\n\"3. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1 wherein said decorative elongated strip comprises a film of polyvinyl chloride having: (i) a decorative coating on the other of said major surfaces thereof, and (ii) a film of transparent weather-resistant material covering said decorative coating and said other of said major surfaces.\n\"4. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 3, said pliable material being a soft polyvinyl chloride.\n\"5. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 4, said decorative coating comprising aluminum.\n\"6. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1, 2, or 5, said adhesive means comprising a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive extending along the length of the interior surface of said bight portion.\n\"7. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 5, said adhesive means comprising a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive extending along the length of said bight portion, said edge protector being sufficiently pliable to be bent without kinking into a circle having a diameter less than three inches at an ambient temperature of 70\no\nF.\n\"8. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 7, said diameter being no greater than two inches.\"",
    "[4]\nReproduced below is figure 4 from the patent which purports to depict in enlarged form a section of the patented door edge protector with the edge of a door 5 inserted into it. (While I do not resort to the drawings to interpret the claims, this figure provides a useful means of describing a common application of the patent.)\n[Figure omitted. See original source.]\nThe core material 8 consists of a pliable polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The thick part at the bend in the \"U\" shape, numbered 8b, is referred to as the \"bight\". The arms or flanges on each side of that bend are numbered 8f. When manufactured there is a bead of glue placed on the bight at the bottom of the channel. When the door edge is installed on a car door, as depicted in figure 4, the glue which is supposed to remain tacky spreads around the car door edge in the manner depicted as 13 in figure 4. The moulding is wrapped in a decorative strip compendiously labelled 9 in the drawing. This decorative strip consists of a film of polyvinyl chloride 10, a thin metallic foil 11, and a covering of a transparent weather-resistant material 12, usually polyester. Decorative material such as 9 can be readily purchased in quantity by makers of door edge and other trims; a common form of 9 is \"Tedlar\". Another commonly available form of decorative material is \"Mylar\" although as I understand it this is not used normally for exterior surfaces.",
    "[5]\nThere are many historical interconnections among the parties and principal witnesses in this case. Several of them appear to have had their beginnings in the car trim business in Canada working for Creators Canada Limited which, until it ceased operation in June, 1981 was a major producer of automotive and furniture trim. Cesare Cosentino, one of the inventors of patent '733, formerly a shareholder of the plaintiff company but now completely out of it and a subpoenaed witness for the defendant, started at Creators Canada in 1968. During some or all of the same period Christopher Hatzikelis (another inventor of patent '733 and a witness for the plaintiff) worked there as well, as did Bogden Ivic, a witness for the defendant in this case. Hatzikelis was general foreman and developer of products at Creators Canada and Cosentino started there as an apprentice. Bogden Ivic worked there during this period in the tool room, engaged in the making of dies, tools and machinery for manufacturing plastic products. Cosentino and Hatzikelis left Creators Canada in 1972 to join others in establishing the plaintiff company Crila. Bogden Ivic left Creators in 1973 and subsequently worked for both the plaintiff and the defendant. Meanwhile Nicola Lattanzio, who appeared as an expert witness for the defendant in this case, commenced working at Creators in 1972 and continued there until 1981.",
    "[6]\nCrila was established for the manufacture of plastic mouldings and trims. The founders were joined in 1973 by Ciro Madonia (another of the inventors of patent '733). Eventually Cosentino was general manager, Hatzikelis was production manager, and Madonia was sales manager of Crila. In the mid-70's Crila was making, among many other mouldings, a \"J\" shaped PVC moulding, with a two-sided adhesive tape attached to it, for use as a door edge for cars. This was the kind of door edge common in the market at that time but was not particularly satisfactory: it was not sufficiently flexible for going around curves in the configuration of a door edge, and was generally difficult to install. Eventually - and the approximate dates are in dispute - Crila developed a \"U\" shaped PVC core door edge, with double-sided adhesive tape inside the \"U\" for attachment to doors. This was ultimately developed further by using as adhesive, instead of tape, a bead of \"hot-melt\" glue inside the channel on the bight, the latter form of the moulding being the subject of the patent in question. During this period of development, some time after the first \"U\" shaped mouldings were made with tape adhesive, Crila also commenced to wrap the decorative layer or \"bright work\" around the flanges of the \"U\" and folded its edges into the inside of the channel as depicted in figure 4 above. This was done for the purpose of better protecting the decorative covering, which otherwise was susceptible to peeling where its minor edges were exposed to damage from weather, carwash equipment, bumps, etc. The evidence disclosed that one of the advantages of the patented product (put in as Exhibit P-7B) over earlier door edges, such as the \"J\" shaped moulding, was its pliability. It could be bent readily around corners of a fairly small radius without kinking. This was achieved by the particular hardness of PVC chosen by Crila for the core of this moulding. This pliability gave the moulding less resilience or gripping power which was compensated for by the use of effective adhesives.",
    "[7]\nOne of the matters in dispute is as to when the final version of the product was first produced (i.e. \"invented\") and sold by Crila. Certain witnesses for the defendant stated that this must have been in the autumn of 1976, whereas certain witnesses for the plaintiff indicated it was in the fall of 1977. This is an important question as the patent was not applied for until March 26, 1979. If the first sales to the public were more than two years prior to this application (i.e., before March 26, 1977) then by virtue of s. 28(1)(c) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, the patent should not have been issued.",
    "[8]\nJohn Mandino, now president of the defendant company which is alleged to have infringed the plaintiff's patent, first gained experience in the plastic manufacturing business by working for the plaintiff. He worked there for a short time in 1973, and then again during the summer of 1976 full time, part-time during the academic year of 1976-77 while he was attending York University, and again during the summer of 1977 full time until August 11th of that year. During 1976 and 1977 he worked both in shipping and in fabrication. He left in August, 1977 in order to establish the defendant company along with members of his family. The defendant company commenced by making other kinds of car trim but, according to Mandino, they first produced and sold in Canada in the fall of 1978 the allegedly infringing door edge which was put in evidence as P-7C. In appearance thos door edge seems virtually identical to the door edge depicted in the plaintiff's patent. In fact the defendant does not deny that its product P-7C infringes claims 1 to 6 of the patent. It does deny that this door edge infringed claims 7 and 8, which claims are with respect to a door edge that is sufficiently pliable to be bent without kinking into a circle with a diameter less than three inches (claim 7) or with a diameter of two inches (claim 8). Since the commencement of this action, the defendant company in 1982 changed its door edge by spreading the hot-melt glue around the whole of the inside of the channel rather than confining it to a bead on the bight. A sample of this modified door edge was put in evidence as Exhibit D-28. This change was not pleaded and it appears to me that it can have no relevance except, perhaps, on the question of remedies.",
    "[9]\nIt is also interesting to note that Bogden Ivic, who worked for Crila periodically between 1975 and May, 1977, subsequently made dies and other equipment for the defendant company including, apparently, the die for the manufacture of the defendant's allegedly infringing product. He says that he made a die for the plaintiff's U-shaped moulding before leaving Crila in May, 1977.",
    "[10]\nThe patent was registered on July 15, 1980. By an assignment dated the same day, the inventors, Hatzikelis, Madonia, and Cosentino assigned to the plaintiff Crila Plastic Industries Limited their rights in the patent. In the meantime Cosentino had left Crila to work for a subsidiary or associated company which he subsequently left in 1981 and eventually severed all ties with Crila. His departure was obviously not amicable. Hatzikelis left Crila in 1985.\nConclusions\n1. Infringement",
    "[11]\nAs noted above, the defendant by its statement of defence only denies infringement with respect to two claims, 7 and 8. This denial as pleaded relates solely to the question of the ability of the defendant's product to be bent into a circle with a diameter of less than three inches without kinking.",
    "[12]\nI am satisfied that the defendant's product comes within claims 7 and 8. First, there is a dispute over the meaning of the word \"kinking\". This is not a word with a well-defined meaning at least in this context. I believe I am therefore at liberty to look at the disclosures to see how the word is used in the patent. At page 3, lines 4 and 5 thereof, the verb \"to kink\" is defined for the purposes of the patent as \"to experience an abrupt and often irreversible change in its (i.e., an edge protector's) curvature\". The other issue in dispute is as to the meaning of the requirement in claim 7, also incorporated by reference in claim 8, that the edge protector be sufficiently pliable \"to be bent ... into a circle\" having a certain diameter. Evidence was given to demonstrate that while the edge protectors of both the plaintiff and the defendant could be bent into such a circle \"in the air\", i.e., without regard to the plane or angle of the \"throat\" of the trim, and that while both could be bent so that the \"throat\" would fit smoothly over an edge with a convex curve of small diameters, there was arguably \"kinking\" when the defendant's edge protector was forced to follow a concave curve of some 2 5/16 inches in diameter. It appears to me, however, that the language of claim 7 (also adopted by reference in claim 8) is clear and understandable in not requiring that the edge protector be fitted on a door edge or other edge in order to pass the test set out in that claim. All that is required is that it be capable of being \"bent without kinking into a circle\". There is no qualification in the test as to the need to follow an edge in bending the material into a circle and, the meaning otherwise being clear, I see no basis for reading such a requirement into the claim. Such a test, while perhaps not the most useful for the purpose, is a measure of the pliability of the moulding which is one of its essential features. I therefore find that the defendant's product as exemplified in Exhibit P-7C infringes all eight claims of patent 1,081,733.",
    "[13]\nThe evidence disclosed that commencing in 1982 the defendant had modified its edge protector so as to spread the pressure-sensitive adhesive up the inside of the flanges as well as having it in the bight. This change was apparently made some time after March, 1982 when the examination for discovery of the defendant took place. This change was never pleaded in the statement of defence nor did counsel for the defendant seek an amendment at the trial in this respect. The new product was put in as Exhibit D-28 and counsel for the defendant argued that this product, at least, did not infringe because claims 6 and 7 (8 being dependent on 7) refer to a \"bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive\" extending along the length of the bight. Counsel argued that the hot-melt glue used in D-28 is not a \"bead\" but is rather a \"layer\" of glue, and is not located just in the bight as these claims contemplate but is spread over the interior surface of the flanges as well as of the bight. I do not accept the defendant's contention in this regard. In the first place, claim 1(c) of the patent refers to \"adhesive means disposed on the interior surface of said channelar member ...\". That description is broad enough to cover literally the defendant's product D-28. Apart from that in my view D-28 infringes the substance of claims 6, 7 and 8 with respect to pressure-sensitive adhesive. I am satisfied that the essential feature of such adhesive is that it be located in the bight and environs. It was not disputed that, when a door which is inserted into such an edge protector, the bead spreads around that door edge and no doubt extends part way up the interior surfaces of the flanges. If one looks at a section of D-28, it is obvious that the bulk of the pressure-sensitive adhesive there is also still in the bight with a thinner amount spread up the flanges. That the defendant's product may achieve a greater utilization of adhesive on the flanges does not detract from the fact that it is utilizing a substantial amount of the adhesive in the bight just as contemplated by claims 6, 7 and 8 of the patent. To the extent, then, that this issue might be relevant in any future proceedings, it is my finding that the defendant's product D-28 has infringed and is infringing all of the claims of the patent.\n2. Validity",
    "[14]\n(a) Lack of invention - This issue has two aspects in the present case: the defendant says that the claims of the patent involve substances or devices that were obvious at the date of application of the patent, and that their association by the patent does not amount to an inventive \"combination\" of known substances but rather an \"aggregation\".",
    "[15]\nI am satisfied that the various elements brought together by the claims of the patent were obvious. As I understand it, the essential features of the \"invention\" as claimed by the plaintiff include: the use of a relatively flexible or pliable U-shaped moulding material (I accept that the reference to \"a pair of spaced-apart flange portions ...\" in claim 1 means a U-shaped moulding); the use of a decorative strip on the outside (with or without a protective coating over it) which is wrapped around the flanges and into the throat of the moulding; and some kind of adhesive inside the moulding (seemingly including double-edged tape, a layer of pressure-sensitive glue or a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive glue in the bight).",
    "[16]\nThese various elements can be found in some of the prior art pleaded by the defendant, all of which precede this \"invention\" by many years. The U-shaped configuration for an edge cover can be found in the following patents: Shanok (U.S. 2,928,201) (D-3.2); Kimbark (D-3.1); Bono (D-3.3); Shanok (U.S. 3,547,516) (D-3.6); Shanok (U.S. 3,517,515) (D-3.7); Kellos (D-3.8); and Weimar (D-3.11). The use of material such as PVC is described in the Hearn patent (D-3.10), as is the use of a decorative cover such as Mylar and the advantages of protecting the minor edge of such decorative covering, in this case by burying it. The use of a pressure-sensitive adhesive to hold on such edge protectors is described in the Kunevicius (D-3.4) and Kellos (D-3.8) patents and the use of beads of tacky adhesive inside the channel is specifically described in the first Shanok patent (U.S. 2,928,201) (D-3.2).",
    "[17]\nEvidence as to general knowledge of those skilled in the art further confirms that the essential elements of the plaintiff's claims were previously known. There was evidence that pliable PVC had been used as a basic material for decorative and protective mouldings, for example by Creators Canada, for many years before this patent was applied for. Decorative strips to cover such mouldings had been available since at least 1972 and the bonding of them to PVC mouldings had been a known technique since at least that time. U-shaped trims such as Silvatrim (P-7A) had been on the market for many years and is in fact referred to as prior art in the patent in issue in this suit. The idea of wrapping the protective covering around a moulding so that the minor edges of that covering would not be exposed once the moulding or trim was installed had been known at least as early as 1972 at Creators Canada. (See, e.g., D-17). The use of adhesives to hold on trim had been known for many years and in particular the use of a hot-melt adhesive such as that contemplated in claims 6, 7 and 8 had been known from at least 1974 onward. As noted above, even the Shanok (U.S. 2,928,201) patent of 1960 (D-3.2) contemplated the use of \"beads\" of a \"tacky, deformable adhesive substance\". Most significantly, D-10, a trim which according to Mr. Lattanzio was in use at Creators Canada prior to his arrival there in 1972, had virtually all of the features covered by the claims of the patent. It was a pliable moulding covered by a decorative strip which was wrapped around the outside of the moulding and extended into the interior so as to be covered when the moulding was installed. An adhesive was used inside the moulding, a tape which would not come within claims 6-8 but could come within claim 1. This moulding arguably differed only with respect to its configuration. It was capable of being bent into a U-shape - and according to Mr. Lattanzio it was used at least sometimes in that shape, including use by some employees to decorate their car doors. This moulding must have been well-known to all or most of the principals of the plaintiff company, having regard to the fact that several people involved at Crila had worked earlier at Creators Canada. More importantly these and other PVC mouldings having been on the market for some years must have been also well-known to those interested in this kind of product and therefore can be regarded as within common general knowledge.",
    "[18]\nThe question remains, however, as to whether by putting together all of these well-known elements the applicants for the patent had produced a \"combination\" which was inventive. The defendant argues that this was merely an \"aggregation\" of known elements, each of which continued to perform its well-known function without any new result flowing from the interaction of two or more known elements. I respectfully adopt the legal tests applied by my colleague Collier, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . After reviewing the established authorities on the subject he stated at pages 189-90:\n\"Mere juxtaposition of parts is insufficient for patentability. The elements must combine for a unitary result. If any element in the arrangement gives its own result, without any result flowing from the combination, then there is no invention.\"\nAfter reviewing the elements said to form the invention, he concluded at page 191:\n\"... In my opinion the elements I have above outlined perform essentially independent functions. They do not collate to produce a new but common result. If any one of them were removed, the others, in my mind, would continue to perform their own individual function. There is here an aggregation, not a combination.\"\nI believe that is the situation in the present case. The U-shaped moulding continues to be a means of covering an edge. The more pliable it is the more easily it follows the contours of the edge. The decorative layer continues to decorate, and the \"wrap-around\" feature of it continues to protect it. The adhesive inside continues to attach one object to another. While there was some suggestion in evidence and argument of the advantage of the closed throat in keeping glue from drying before installation, and of the combined effect of the shape of the moulding, the wrap-around feature and the glue in keeping out water after installation, these advantages are not claimed by the patent.",
    "[19]\nI considered carefully the possibility that the use of a moulding that is pliable (thus enabling it to follow the contours, but reducing its gripping power) is made more feasible by the use of glue (providing the gripping effect which is lost through greater pliability), and that these two features together could amount to a combination. This advantage is neither specifically disclosed nor claimed in the patent. Moreover, I have concluded that all this \"combination\" really amounts to is a decision to use glue to stick on something which otherwise would not grip. It involves the workman deciding that \"if it won't stay in place, we should put some glue on it\". This hardly seems to me to be the \"scintilla of inventiveness\" which is the minimum requirement for an invention. Nor do I think a decision as to the location of the glue, moving the \"bead\" from the flanges to the bight, for example, is even a small flash of inventive genius. The glue itself was a commonly known product.",
    "[20]\nI therefore conclude that the claims of the patent do not disclose an invention.",
    "[21]\n(b) Anticipation - The defendant alleges anticipation of the patent on three different grounds: that the invention was known or used by others first, that it was described in other patents more than two years before the patent in question was applied for, and that the plaintiff had itself used and sold the invention in Canada for more than two years prior to its application for the patent in question.",
    "[22]\nThe first contention is based in s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act. This must be read with s. 63(1)(a) of the Act which requires that for anticipation by prior use or knowledge by others, the invention must have been disclosed so that it had become available to the public prior to the date of the patent application. The evidence here was very sketchy and mostly consisted of testimony by Bogden Ivic that he had made such a product in Yugoslavia which was sold there. His evidence was far from specific and I was not satisfied from his description that the product was the same as the \"invention\". The defendant also pleaded such prior knowledge or use by the inventors of the patents pleaded as prior art. For reasons to be discussed below I do not think any of the said prior art pecisely anticipated this invention. Further, the defendant pleaded sales by the plaintiff to third parties as a basis for a claim that such third parties had known, used, and made available to the public the invention before the application for the patent. I do not accept this as a proper basis for invoking s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act. That paragraph surely must be interpreted as applying only to knowledge or use of the invention by a person other than the inventor by means other than obtaining the knowledge or the product from the inventor himself. Section 28(1)(a) applies only where the invention was \"known or used by any other person before he (the inventor) invented it\". This is the first requirement for declaring invalid a patent on this ground. The second requirement is that set out in s. 63(1)(a) of the Patent Act which says that the invention known or used by the other person must have been made available to the public prior to the date of application for the patent. The first requirement can obviously not be met through knowledge gained from the inventor, because it assumes that that knowledge has been obtained before the invention takes place. Further, to construe the section as implied by the defendant's pleadings would render meaningless s. 28(1)(c) which allows an inventor, or another person, up to two years of sales in Canada after the invention is made and prior to the filing of an application for a patent, without loss of the right of the inventor to obtain a patent. See also  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 66-67.",
    "[23]\nThe defendant further alleges anticipation by prior publication in eleven patents which are pleaded as prior art and all of which were issued more than two years before the application for the plaintiff's patent. Such a plea is based on s. 28(1)(b) of the Patent Act. It is well settled that for anticipation by prior publication there must be a single document which would give a skilled workman what he would have needed to produce without difficulty the invention allegedly anticipated by it. It must correspond so closely that, had the patent issued prior to that document, the document would have described an \"invention\" infringing the patent. See generally the authorities quoted in the Corning Glass case supra at 63-64. I have examined the patents pleaded here as anticipation and can find none of them which meets these tests. Each has substantial differences from the patent in suit. I therefore find no anticipation of patent 1,081,733 by prior publication.",
    "[24]\nThe more difficult issue is raised by the defendant's allegation that the plaintiff had put its invention to public use and on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to the date of its application for the patent, thereby precluding valid registration due to the provisions of s. 28(1)(c) of the Patent Act. The patent was applied for on March 26, 1979, so this raises the question as to whether the plaintiff sold its product in Canada prior to March 26, 1977. A large part of the trial was devoted to this question and there was much conflicting evidence. The principal witnesses for the defendant in this respect were John Mandino, Vice-President of the defendant company, and Cesare Cosentino, one of the inventors who applied for patent 1,081,733 and upon its issue assigned his rights to the plaintiff. He had also been an officer of the plaintiff company and had left it, all as described earlier. These and other witnesses generally supported the view that the development of the U-shaped door edge at Crila had commenced as soon as perhaps the end of 1975 or at the latest in early 1976, that it had gone through a stage where a door edge was produced using double-sided tape in the interior as an adhesive, with experiments during the summer using hot-melt glue instead which culminated in the fall of 1976 in production and sale of the door edge with hot-melt glue as the adhesive. Numerous documents were introduced by the defendant to support this version of events but unfortunately most of the documents proved to be quite ambiguous. For its part the plaintiff's main witnesses as to the timing were Christopher Hatzikelis, also one of the inventors and assignors of the patent and a former officer of the plaintiff, together with Casey August, the patent agent who advised the inventors and submitted their application for the patent. Their evidence was to the effect that the U-shaped moulding with a Tedlar covering that did not wrap around was first developed in April, 1977, at Crila; that it was probably marketed in this form with a double-sided tape inside as the adhesive, that experiments were undertaken during the summer using hot-melt glue; and that by the fall of 1977 a satisfactory product using hot-melt glue and wrap-around Tedlar had been developed which was subsequently put into production and offered for sale.",
    "[25]\nAfter reviewing the oral evidence and the documents I am not satisfied that the defendant has discharged the burden of proof on it to establish, on a balance of probabilities, sale by the plaintiff of its patented product prior to March 26, 1977. With respect to the documents, all of which are open to more than one interpretation, I find no persuasive reason for preferring the defendant's interpretation. In respect to Exhibit D-19 it appears to me, in combination with Mr. Hatzikelis' testimony, to be strongly supportive of the plaintiff's version, namely that the first hot-melt machine was rented in July, 1977 and then purchased in September, 1977. This is consistent with production and sales having commenced in the fall of 1977 well after the critical date of March 26, 1977. As for the witnesses, I found Mr. Hatzikelis to be clear and forthright at the trial. As one who no longer has any interest in the plaintiff company but who apparently left it on amicable terms, he had no apparent interest in the success or failure of the plaintiff's suit. His evidence and the plaintiff's version of the facts was strongly corroborated in certain respects by the evidence of Mr. August, the patent agent. His evidence, and his \"Time Sheet\" with respect to work done for Crila, put in as Exhibit P-24, clearly indicate that he met with Crila officials in June of 1978 to discuss the possibility of applying for a patent for the new door edge. I am satisfied from his evidence that he would have raised the question of when sales first commenced, and if he had been told that this had occurred as early as the summer of 1976, as the defendant contends, there would presumably either have been a rush to file an application or a decision not to file any at all. Instead, it was some nine months later before the application was filed. Mr. August's view of events is supported by Exhibit P-20, a letter from Mr. Cosentino on behalf of Crila advising Mr. August, obviously in response to an inquiry from the latter, that \"there was a product in the field by November 21, 1977\". Mr. Cosentino's explanation of this I did not find convincing.",
    "[26]\nInsofar as the defendant's witnesses are concerned, I am not prepared to put as much weight on Mr. Cosentino's testimony as he obviously left Crila as a result of contention which may well have affected his testimony. Further, it was clear that he was not directly involved in production at Crila, at least at the critical times. He was not very knowledgeable as to what machines, including hot-melt machines, were on the premises. As for Mr. Mandino, the other principal witness for the defendant on the question of date of first production and sale, he is vitally interested in the outcome of this litigation as Vice-President of the defendant company. He was employed by the plaintiff during the periods of 1976 and 1977 and testified from knowledge gained in that way. He clearly had no overall responsibilities in the plaintiff's establishment. He freely admits to having copied the plaintiff's product and now seeks to avoid liability for infringement by proving that the plaintiff had sold its product publicly for more than two years before it applied for the patent. I must weigh his evidence having these facts in mind. Mr. Bogden Ivic was quite forthcoming and straight forward. The principal evidence he gave relevant to this question was to the effect that he had developed a die for Crila suitable for making U-shaped moulding and that he had done this by early 1976. I have not attached very much weight to this evidence as it is clear that Mr. Ivic had made many dies for many manufacturers of plastic over many years. It was far from clear, if he did make such a die for Crila at that time, that it was the one used to produce the patented product. Certainly Mr. Hatzikelis, who was more directly responsible for the development of this moulding, gave evidence inconsistent with that of Mr. Ivic. Other witnesses called by the defendant included Mr. Chappell Boulton and Mr. Hiram Smith, both of whom had been retail users of the patented door edge. While initially certain that they had purchased only one kind of door edge from the plaintiff, namely the product now described in the plaintiff's patent, and that they had made such purchases prior to the time the plaintiff says its product was invented, on cross-examination they were considerably less certain as to the precise product they had first bought. These witnesses were sincere and have no apparent interest in the outcome of this case, but I cannot attach a great deal of weight to evidence of events of over nine years ago concerning questions which could not, by their nature, have been of great importance to them at the time.",
    "[27]\nIt must be recognized that there are weaknesses in the plaintiff's contentions as to the date of invention and sale of its patented product. As noted, the available documents are capable of more than one interpretation. Further, it is strange, and worthy of comment, that in response to requests from the defendant during discovery the plaintiff was unable to locate any of its production documents, quality control documents, or purchase orders relating to the production or sale of its door edge for the period January 1, 1976, to March 26, 1977. The only explanation which it gave, on discovery, was that it believes such documents were lost or destroyed at the time of its move to new premises on May 11, 1978. No evidence was called at the trial to confirm, explain, or elaborate on this response. One cannot help but be struck by the complete lack of such documents in the plaintiff's files and the coincidence that these would be documents highly relevant to this litigation.",
    "[28]\nBe that as it may, the burden is on the defendant to prove on a balance of probabilities the allegations in its counter-claim of invalidity through prior sale by the plaintiff, and I am not satisfied that it has met that burden.",
    "[29]\n(c) Covetousness - The defendant alleges that the claims of the patent go beyond what was invented. Having regard to my finding above that there was no invention, it is unnecessary for me to consider this question further.",
    "[30]\nIn support of its allegation of covetousness, the defendant sought to put in evidence the U.S. patent obtained later by the plaintiff for the same subject-matter, with a view to showing that in the U.S. patent the plaintiff had used more restrictive language in the claims. It was said that this at least put an onus on the plaintiff to explain why different language was used in the U.S. claims. As it is unnecessary for me to consider further the question of covetousness it is also unnecessary to consider further the admissibility or effect of such evidence.\nCosts",
    "[31]\nI have concluded that no costs should be awarded to either party. While the plaintiff has failed to make out its claim due to the invalidity of its patent and the defendant has to that extent succeeded, a very substantial part of the trial was devoted to the defendant's allegation that the patent was invalid because the plaintiff had sold its \"invention\" for more than two years prior to filing its patent application. This allegation was not proved. A substantial part of the costs of the action are attributable to this allegation in the counter-claim. Under the circumstances, I do not think either party is entitled to costs.\nAction dismissed.\nEditor: Steven C. McMinniman/sms\n[End of document]"

  "full_text": "[1]\nStrayer, J.\n: This is an action for infringement in respect of Canadian patent 1,081,733 for a \"Pliable Edge Protector\", of which the plaintiff is assignee. The defendant denies infringement in respect of two claims of the patent, and by its defence and counter-claim alleges as well that the patent is invalid. Invalidity is alleged on the basis of: lack of invention, both on the grounds that the subject of the patent was obvious and that it did not represent a new \"combination\" but rather an \"aggregation\" of known devices giving known results; anticipation, by prior use and sale by others in a manner making such product available to the public, by prior publication, and by sale in Canada by the plaintiff of the same product more than two years prior to its application for a patent; and \"covetousness\", i.e., that the claims are broader than the alleged invention described in the disclosures of the patent.\nBackground Facts\n[2]\nThe \"Pliable Edge Protector\" in question is largely used for the purpose of protecting car door edges although it may be used on other thin edges on cars, boats, furniture, etc. The principal demand for the type of product in question here, whether made by the plaintiff or the defendant, appears to be in the \"after-market\" in respect of cars: that is, it is sold to private owners of cars for adding to their vehicles, rather than to manufacturers for installation as original equipment.\n[3]\nThe claims of patent '733 are as follows:\n\"1. A pliable edge protector comprising:\na) an elongated extruded channelar member formed of pliable material, said extruded channelar member having a bight portion and a pair of spaced-apart flange portions projecting therefrom to form an interior throat therebetween;\nb) a decorative elongated strip of thin material, said decorative elongated strip having two major surfaces and two minor edge surfaces extending along the length of the decorative strip, one of said major surfaces covering the exterior surface of said extruded channelar member and extending over the projecting ends of said flange portions to thereby dispose said minor edge surfaces within said interior throat; and\n\"2. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1, said pliable material being a soft polyvinyl chloride.\n\"3. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1 wherein said decorative elongated strip comprises a film of polyvinyl chloride having: (i) a decorative coating on the other of said major surfaces thereof, and (ii) a film of transparent weather-resistant material covering said decorative coating and said other of said major surfaces.\n\"4. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 3, said pliable material being a soft polyvinyl chloride.\n\"5. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 4, said decorative coating comprising aluminum.\n\"6. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1, 2, or 5, said adhesive means comprising a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive extending along the length of the interior surface of said bight portion.\n\"7. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 5, said adhesive means comprising a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive extending along the length of said bight portion, said edge protector being sufficiently pliable to be bent without kinking into a circle having a diameter less than three inches at an ambient temperature of 70\no\nF.\n\"8. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 7, said diameter being no greater than two inches.\"\n[4]\nReproduced below is figure 4 from the patent which purports to depict in enlarged form a section of the patented door edge protector with the edge of a door 5 inserted into it. (While I do not resort to the drawings to interpret the claims, this figure provides a useful means of describing a common application of the patent.)\n[Figure omitted. See original source.]\nThe core material 8 consists of a pliable polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The thick part at the bend in the \"U\" shape, numbered 8b, is referred to as the \"bight\". The arms or flanges on each side of that bend are numbered 8f. When manufactured there is a bead of glue placed on the bight at the bottom of the channel. When the door edge is installed on a car door, as depicted in figure 4, the glue which is supposed to remain tacky spreads around the car door edge in the manner depicted as 13 in figure 4. The moulding is wrapped in a decorative strip compendiously labelled 9 in the drawing. This decorative strip consists of a film of polyvinyl chloride 10, a thin metallic foil 11, and a covering of a transparent weather-resistant material 12, usually polyester. Decorative material such as 9 can be readily purchased in quantity by makers of door edge and other trims; a common form of 9 is \"Tedlar\". Another commonly available form of decorative material is \"Mylar\" although as I understand it this is not used normally for exterior surfaces.\n[5]\nThere are many historical interconnections among the parties and principal witnesses in this case. Several of them appear to have had their beginnings in the car trim business in Canada working for Creators Canada Limited which, until it ceased operation in June, 1981 was a major producer of automotive and furniture trim. Cesare Cosentino, one of the inventors of patent '733, formerly a shareholder of the plaintiff company but now completely out of it and a subpoenaed witness for the defendant, started at Creators Canada in 1968. During some or all of the same period Christopher Hatzikelis (another inventor of patent '733 and a witness for the plaintiff) worked there as well, as did Bogden Ivic, a witness for the defendant in this case. Hatzikelis was general foreman and developer of products at Creators Canada and Cosentino started there as an apprentice. Bogden Ivic worked there during this period in the tool room, engaged in the making of dies, tools and machinery for manufacturing plastic products. Cosentino and Hatzikelis left Creators Canada in 1972 to join others in establishing the plaintiff company Crila. Bogden Ivic left Creators in 1973 and subsequently worked for both the plaintiff and the defendant. Meanwhile Nicola Lattanzio, who appeared as an expert witness for the defendant in this case, commenced working at Creators in 1972 and continued there until 1981.\n[6]\nCrila was established for the manufacture of plastic mouldings and trims. The founders were joined in 1973 by Ciro Madonia (another of the inventors of patent '733). Eventually Cosentino was general manager, Hatzikelis was production manager, and Madonia was sales manager of Crila. In the mid-70's Crila was making, among many other mouldings, a \"J\" shaped PVC moulding, with a two-sided adhesive tape attached to it, for use as a door edge for cars. This was the kind of door edge common in the market at that time but was not particularly satisfactory: it was not sufficiently flexible for going around curves in the configuration of a door edge, and was generally difficult to install. Eventually - and the approximate dates are in dispute - Crila developed a \"U\" shaped PVC core door edge, with double-sided adhesive tape inside the \"U\" for attachment to doors. This was ultimately developed further by using as adhesive, instead of tape, a bead of \"hot-melt\" glue inside the channel on the bight, the latter form of the moulding being the subject of the patent in question. During this period of development, some time after the first \"U\" shaped mouldings were made with tape adhesive, Crila also commenced to wrap the decorative layer or \"bright work\" around the flanges of the \"U\" and folded its edges into the inside of the channel as depicted in figure 4 above. This was done for the purpose of better protecting the decorative covering, which otherwise was susceptible to peeling where its minor edges were exposed to damage from weather, carwash equipment, bumps, etc. The evidence disclosed that one of the advantages of the patented product (put in as Exhibit P-7B) over earlier door edges, such as the \"J\" shaped moulding, was its pliability. It could be bent readily around corners of a fairly small radius without kinking. This was achieved by the particular hardness of PVC chosen by Crila for the core of this moulding. This pliability gave the moulding less resilience or gripping power which was compensated for by the use of effective adhesives.\n[7]\nOne of the matters in dispute is as to when the final version of the product was first produced (i.e. \"invented\") and sold by Crila. Certain witnesses for the defendant stated that this must have been in the autumn of 1976, whereas certain witnesses for the plaintiff indicated it was in the fall of 1977. This is an important question as the patent was not applied for until March 26, 1979. If the first sales to the public were more than two years prior to this application (i.e., before March 26, 1977) then by virtue of s. 28(1)(c) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, the patent should not have been issued.\n[8]\nJohn Mandino, now president of the defendant company which is alleged to have infringed the plaintiff's patent, first gained experience in the plastic manufacturing business by working for the plaintiff. He worked there for a short time in 1973, and then again during the summer of 1976 full time, part-time during the academic year of 1976-77 while he was attending York University, and again during the summer of 1977 full time until August 11th of that year. During 1976 and 1977 he worked both in shipping and in fabrication. He left in August, 1977 in order to establish the defendant company along with members of his family. The defendant company commenced by making other kinds of car trim but, according to Mandino, they first produced and sold in Canada in the fall of 1978 the allegedly infringing door edge which was put in evidence as P-7C. In appearance thos door edge seems virtually identical to the door edge depicted in the plaintiff's patent. In fact the defendant does not deny that its product P-7C infringes claims 1 to 6 of the patent. It does deny that this door edge infringed claims 7 and 8, which claims are with respect to a door edge that is sufficiently pliable to be bent without kinking into a circle with a diameter less than three inches (claim 7) or with a diameter of two inches (claim 8). Since the commencement of this action, the defendant company in 1982 changed its door edge by spreading the hot-melt glue around the whole of the inside of the channel rather than confining it to a bead on the bight. A sample of this modified door edge was put in evidence as Exhibit D-28. This change was not pleaded and it appears to me that it can have no relevance except, perhaps, on the question of remedies.\n[9]\nIt is also interesting to note that Bogden Ivic, who worked for Crila periodically between 1975 and May, 1977, subsequently made dies and other equipment for the defendant company including, apparently, the die for the manufacture of the defendant's allegedly infringing product. He says that he made a die for the plaintiff's U-shaped moulding before leaving Crila in May, 1977.\n[10]\nThe patent was registered on July 15, 1980. By an assignment dated the same day, the inventors, Hatzikelis, Madonia, and Cosentino assigned to the plaintiff Crila Plastic Industries Limited their rights in the patent. In the meantime Cosentino had left Crila to work for a subsidiary or associated company which he subsequently left in 1981 and eventually severed all ties with Crila. His departure was obviously not amicable. Hatzikelis left Crila in 1985.\nConclusions\n1. Infringement\n[11]\nAs noted above, the defendant by its statement of defence only denies infringement with respect to two claims, 7 and 8. This denial as pleaded relates solely to the question of the ability of the defendant's product to be bent into a circle with a diameter of less than three inches without kinking.\n[12]\nI am satisfied that the defendant's product comes within claims 7 and 8. First, there is a dispute over the meaning of the word \"kinking\". This is not a word with a well-defined meaning at least in this context. I believe I am therefore at liberty to look at the disclosures to see how the word is used in the patent. At page 3, lines 4 and 5 thereof, the verb \"to kink\" is defined for the purposes of the patent as \"to experience an abrupt and often irreversible change in its (i.e., an edge protector's) curvature\". The other issue in dispute is as to the meaning of the requirement in claim 7, also incorporated by reference in claim 8, that the edge protector be sufficiently pliable \"to be bent ... into a circle\" having a certain diameter. Evidence was given to demonstrate that while the edge protectors of both the plaintiff and the defendant could be bent into such a circle \"in the air\", i.e., without regard to the plane or angle of the \"throat\" of the trim, and that while both could be bent so that the \"throat\" would fit smoothly over an edge with a convex curve of small diameters, there was arguably \"kinking\" when the defendant's edge protector was forced to follow a concave curve of some 2 5/16 inches in diameter. It appears to me, however, that the language of claim 7 (also adopted by reference in claim 8) is clear and understandable in not requiring that the edge protector be fitted on a door edge or other edge in order to pass the test set out in that claim. All that is required is that it be capable of being \"bent without kinking into a circle\". There is no qualification in the test as to the need to follow an edge in bending the material into a circle and, the meaning otherwise being clear, I see no basis for reading such a requirement into the claim. Such a test, while perhaps not the most useful for the purpose, is a measure of the pliability of the moulding which is one of its essential features. I therefore find that the defendant's product as exemplified in Exhibit P-7C infringes all eight claims of patent 1,081,733.\n[13]\nThe evidence disclosed that commencing in 1982 the defendant had modified its edge protector so as to spread the pressure-sensitive adhesive up the inside of the flanges as well as having it in the bight. This change was apparently made some time after March, 1982 when the examination for discovery of the defendant took place. This change was never pleaded in the statement of defence nor did counsel for the defendant seek an amendment at the trial in this respect. The new product was put in as Exhibit D-28 and counsel for the defendant argued that this product, at least, did not infringe because claims 6 and 7 (8 being dependent on 7) refer to a \"bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive\" extending along the length of the bight. Counsel argued that the hot-melt glue used in D-28 is not a \"bead\" but is rather a \"layer\" of glue, and is not located just in the bight as these claims contemplate but is spread over the interior surface of the flanges as well as of the bight. I do not accept the defendant's contention in this regard. In the first place, claim 1(c) of the patent refers to \"adhesive means disposed on the interior surface of said channelar member ...\". That description is broad enough to cover literally the defendant's product D-28. Apart from that in my view D-28 infringes the substance of claims 6, 7 and 8 with respect to pressure-sensitive adhesive. I am satisfied that the essential feature of such adhesive is that it be located in the bight and environs. It was not disputed that, when a door which is inserted into such an edge protector, the bead spreads around that door edge and no doubt extends part way up the interior surfaces of the flanges. If one looks at a section of D-28, it is obvious that the bulk of the pressure-sensitive adhesive there is also still in the bight with a thinner amount spread up the flanges. That the defendant's product may achieve a greater utilization of adhesive on the flanges does not detract from the fact that it is utilizing a substantial amount of the adhesive in the bight just as contemplated by claims 6, 7 and 8 of the patent. To the extent, then, that this issue might be relevant in any future proceedings, it is my finding that the defendant's product D-28 has infringed and is infringing all of the claims of the patent.\n2. Validity\n[14]\n(a) Lack of invention - This issue has two aspects in the present case: the defendant says that the claims of the patent involve substances or devices that were obvious at the date of application of the patent, and that their association by the patent does not amount to an inventive \"combination\" of known substances but rather an \"aggregation\".\n[15]\nI am satisfied that the various elements brought together by the claims of the patent were obvious. As I understand it, the essential features of the \"invention\" as claimed by the plaintiff include: the use of a relatively flexible or pliable U-shaped moulding material (I accept that the reference to \"a pair of spaced-apart flange portions ...\" in claim 1 means a U-shaped moulding); the use of a decorative strip on the outside (with or without a protective coating over it) which is wrapped around the flanges and into the throat of the moulding; and some kind of adhesive inside the moulding (seemingly including double-edged tape, a layer of pressure-sensitive glue or a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive glue in the bight).\n[16]\nThese various elements can be found in some of the prior art pleaded by the defendant, all of which precede this \"invention\" by many years. The U-shaped configuration for an edge cover can be found in the following patents: Shanok (U.S. 2,928,201) (D-3.2); Kimbark (D-3.1); Bono (D-3.3); Shanok (U.S. 3,547,516) (D-3.6); Shanok (U.S. 3,517,515) (D-3.7); Kellos (D-3.8); and Weimar (D-3.11). The use of material such as PVC is described in the Hearn patent (D-3.10), as is the use of a decorative cover such as Mylar and the advantages of protecting the minor edge of such decorative covering, in this case by burying it. The use of a pressure-sensitive adhesive to hold on such edge protectors is described in the Kunevicius (D-3.4) and Kellos (D-3.8) patents and the use of beads of tacky adhesive inside the channel is specifically described in the first Shanok patent (U.S. 2,928,201) (D-3.2).\n[17]\nEvidence as to general knowledge of those skilled in the art further confirms that the essential elements of the plaintiff's claims were previously known. There was evidence that pliable PVC had been used as a basic material for decorative and protective mouldings, for example by Creators Canada, for many years before this patent was applied for. Decorative strips to cover such mouldings had been available since at least 1972 and the bonding of them to PVC mouldings had been a known technique since at least that time. U-shaped trims such as Silvatrim (P-7A) had been on the market for many years and is in fact referred to as prior art in the patent in issue in this suit. The idea of wrapping the protective covering around a moulding so that the minor edges of that covering would not be exposed once the moulding or trim was installed had been known at least as early as 1972 at Creators Canada. (See, e.g., D-17). The use of adhesives to hold on trim had been known for many years and in particular the use of a hot-melt adhesive such as that contemplated in claims 6, 7 and 8 had been known from at least 1974 onward. As noted above, even the Shanok (U.S. 2,928,201) patent of 1960 (D-3.2) contemplated the use of \"beads\" of a \"tacky, deformable adhesive substance\". Most significantly, D-10, a trim which according to Mr. Lattanzio was in use at Creators Canada prior to his arrival there in 1972, had virtually all of the features covered by the claims of the patent. It was a pliable moulding covered by a decorative strip which was wrapped around the outside of the moulding and extended into the interior so as to be covered when the moulding was installed. An adhesive was used inside the moulding, a tape which would not come within claims 6-8 but could come within claim 1. This moulding arguably differed only with respect to its configuration. It was capable of being bent into a U-shape - and according to Mr. Lattanzio it was used at least sometimes in that shape, including use by some employees to decorate their car doors. This moulding must have been well-known to all or most of the principals of the plaintiff company, having regard to the fact that several people involved at Crila had worked earlier at Creators Canada. More importantly these and other PVC mouldings having been on the market for some years must have been also well-known to those interested in this kind of product and therefore can be regarded as within common general knowledge.\n[18]\nThe question remains, however, as to whether by putting together all of these well-known elements the applicants for the patent had produced a \"combination\" which was inventive. The defendant argues that this was merely an \"aggregation\" of known elements, each of which continued to perform its well-known function without any new result flowing from the interaction of two or more known elements. I respectfully adopt the legal tests applied by my colleague Collier, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . After reviewing the established authorities on the subject he stated at pages 189-90:\n\"Mere juxtaposition of parts is insufficient for patentability. The elements must combine for a unitary result. If any element in the arrangement gives its own result, without any result flowing from the combination, then there is no invention.\"\nAfter reviewing the elements said to form the invention, he concluded at page 191:\n\"... In my opinion the elements I have above outlined perform essentially independent functions. They do not collate to produce a new but common result. If any one of them were removed, the others, in my mind, would continue to perform their own individual function. There is here an aggregation, not a combination.\"\nI believe that is the situation in the present case. The U-shaped moulding continues to be a means of covering an edge. The more pliable it is the more easily it follows the contours of the edge. The decorative layer continues to decorate, and the \"wrap-around\" feature of it continues to protect it. The adhesive inside continues to attach one object to another. While there was some suggestion in evidence and argument of the advantage of the closed throat in keeping glue from drying before installation, and of the combined effect of the shape of the moulding, the wrap-around feature and the glue in keeping out water after installation, these advantages are not claimed by the patent.\n[19]\nI considered carefully the possibility that the use of a moulding that is pliable (thus enabling it to follow the contours, but reducing its gripping power) is made more feasible by the use of glue (providing the gripping effect which is lost through greater pliability), and that these two features together could amount to a combination. This advantage is neither specifically disclosed nor claimed in the patent. Moreover, I have concluded that all this \"combination\" really amounts to is a decision to use glue to stick on something which otherwise would not grip. It involves the workman deciding that \"if it won't stay in place, we should put some glue on it\". This hardly seems to me to be the \"scintilla of inventiveness\" which is the minimum requirement for an invention. Nor do I think a decision as to the location of the glue, moving the \"bead\" from the flanges to the bight, for example, is even a small flash of inventive genius. The glue itself was a commonly known product.\n[20]\nI therefore conclude that the claims of the patent do not disclose an invention.\n[21]\n(b) Anticipation - The defendant alleges anticipation of the patent on three different grounds: that the invention was known or used by others first, that it was described in other patents more than two years before the patent in question was applied for, and that the plaintiff had itself used and sold the invention in Canada for more than two years prior to its application for the patent in question.\n[22]\nThe first contention is based in s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act. This must be read with s. 63(1)(a) of the Act which requires that for anticipation by prior use or knowledge by others, the invention must have been disclosed so that it had become available to the public prior to the date of the patent application. The evidence here was very sketchy and mostly consisted of testimony by Bogden Ivic that he had made such a product in Yugoslavia which was sold there. His evidence was far from specific and I was not satisfied from his description that the product was the same as the \"invention\". The defendant also pleaded such prior knowledge or use by the inventors of the patents pleaded as prior art. For reasons to be discussed below I do not think any of the said prior art pecisely anticipated this invention. Further, the defendant pleaded sales by the plaintiff to third parties as a basis for a claim that such third parties had known, used, and made available to the public the invention before the application for the patent. I do not accept this as a proper basis for invoking s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act. That paragraph surely must be interpreted as applying only to knowledge or use of the invention by a person other than the inventor by means other than obtaining the knowledge or the product from the inventor himself. Section 28(1)(a) applies only where the invention was \"known or used by any other person before he (the inventor) invented it\". This is the first requirement for declaring invalid a patent on this ground. The second requirement is that set out in s. 63(1)(a) of the Patent Act which says that the invention known or used by the other person must have been made available to the public prior to the date of application for the patent. The first requirement can obviously not be met through knowledge gained from the inventor, because it assumes that that knowledge has been obtained before the invention takes place. Further, to construe the section as implied by the defendant's pleadings would render meaningless s. 28(1)(c) which allows an inventor, or another person, up to two years of sales in Canada after the invention is made and prior to the filing of an application for a patent, without loss of the right of the inventor to obtain a patent. See also  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 66-67.\n[23]\nThe defendant further alleges anticipation by prior publication in eleven patents which are pleaded as prior art and all of which were issued more than two years before the application for the plaintiff's patent. Such a plea is based on s. 28(1)(b) of the Patent Act. It is well settled that for anticipation by prior publication there must be a single document which would give a skilled workman what he would have needed to produce without difficulty the invention allegedly anticipated by it. It must correspond so closely that, had the patent issued prior to that document, the document would have described an \"invention\" infringing the patent. See generally the authorities quoted in the Corning Glass case supra at 63-64. I have examined the patents pleaded here as anticipation and can find none of them which meets these tests. Each has substantial differences from the patent in suit. I therefore find no anticipation of patent 1,081,733 by prior publication.\n[24]\nThe more difficult issue is raised by the defendant's allegation that the plaintiff had put its invention to public use and on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to the date of its application for the patent, thereby precluding valid registration due to the provisions of s. 28(1)(c) of the Patent Act. The patent was applied for on March 26, 1979, so this raises the question as to whether the plaintiff sold its product in Canada prior to March 26, 1977. A large part of the trial was devoted to this question and there was much conflicting evidence. The principal witnesses for the defendant in this respect were John Mandino, Vice-President of the defendant company, and Cesare Cosentino, one of the inventors who applied for patent 1,081,733 and upon its issue assigned his rights to the plaintiff. He had also been an officer of the plaintiff company and had left it, all as described earlier. These and other witnesses generally supported the view that the development of the U-shaped door edge at Crila had commenced as soon as perhaps the end of 1975 or at the latest in early 1976, that it had gone through a stage where a door edge was produced using double-sided tape in the interior as an adhesive, with experiments during the summer using hot-melt glue instead which culminated in the fall of 1976 in production and sale of the door edge with hot-melt glue as the adhesive. Numerous documents were introduced by the defendant to support this version of events but unfortunately most of the documents proved to be quite ambiguous. For its part the plaintiff's main witnesses as to the timing were Christopher Hatzikelis, also one of the inventors and assignors of the patent and a former officer of the plaintiff, together with Casey August, the patent agent who advised the inventors and submitted their application for the patent. Their evidence was to the effect that the U-shaped moulding with a Tedlar covering that did not wrap around was first developed in April, 1977, at Crila; that it was probably marketed in this form with a double-sided tape inside as the adhesive, that experiments were undertaken during the summer using hot-melt glue; and that by the fall of 1977 a satisfactory product using hot-melt glue and wrap-around Tedlar had been developed which was subsequently put into production and offered for sale.\n[25]\nAfter reviewing the oral evidence and the documents I am not satisfied that the defendant has discharged the burden of proof on it to establish, on a balance of probabilities, sale by the plaintiff of its patented product prior to March 26, 1977. With respect to the documents, all of which are open to more than one interpretation, I find no persuasive reason for preferring the defendant's interpretation. In respect to Exhibit D-19 it appears to me, in combination with Mr. Hatzikelis' testimony, to be strongly supportive of the plaintiff's version, namely that the first hot-melt machine was rented in July, 1977 and then purchased in September, 1977. This is consistent with production and sales having commenced in the fall of 1977 well after the critical date of March 26, 1977. As for the witnesses, I found Mr. Hatzikelis to be clear and forthright at the trial. As one who no longer has any interest in the plaintiff company but who apparently left it on amicable terms, he had no apparent interest in the success or failure of the plaintiff's suit. His evidence and the plaintiff's version of the facts was strongly corroborated in certain respects by the evidence of Mr. August, the patent agent. His evidence, and his \"Time Sheet\" with respect to work done for Crila, put in as Exhibit P-24, clearly indicate that he met with Crila officials in June of 1978 to discuss the possibility of applying for a patent for the new door edge. I am satisfied from his evidence that he would have raised the question of when sales first commenced, and if he had been told that this had occurred as early as the summer of 1976, as the defendant contends, there would presumably either have been a rush to file an application or a decision not to file any at all. Instead, it was some nine months later before the application was filed. Mr. August's view of events is supported by Exhibit P-20, a letter from Mr. Cosentino on behalf of Crila advising Mr. August, obviously in response to an inquiry from the latter, that \"there was a product in the field by November 21, 1977\". Mr. Cosentino's explanation of this I did not find convincing.\n[26]\nInsofar as the defendant's witnesses are concerned, I am not prepared to put as much weight on Mr. Cosentino's testimony as he obviously left Crila as a result of contention which may well have affected his testimony. Further, it was clear that he was not directly involved in production at Crila, at least at the critical times. He was not very knowledgeable as to what machines, including hot-melt machines, were on the premises. As for Mr. Mandino, the other principal witness for the defendant on the question of date of first production and sale, he is vitally interested in the outcome of this litigation as Vice-President of the defendant company. He was employed by the plaintiff during the periods of 1976 and 1977 and testified from knowledge gained in that way. He clearly had no overall responsibilities in the plaintiff's establishment. He freely admits to having copied the plaintiff's product and now seeks to avoid liability for infringement by proving that the plaintiff had sold its product publicly for more than two years before it applied for the patent. I must weigh his evidence having these facts in mind. Mr. Bogden Ivic was quite forthcoming and straight forward. The principal evidence he gave relevant to this question was to the effect that he had developed a die for Crila suitable for making U-shaped moulding and that he had done this by early 1976. I have not attached very much weight to this evidence as it is clear that Mr. Ivic had made many dies for many manufacturers of plastic over many years. It was far from clear, if he did make such a die for Crila at that time, that it was the one used to produce the patented product. Certainly Mr. Hatzikelis, who was more directly responsible for the development of this moulding, gave evidence inconsistent with that of Mr. Ivic. Other witnesses called by the defendant included Mr. Chappell Boulton and Mr. Hiram Smith, both of whom had been retail users of the patented door edge. While initially certain that they had purchased only one kind of door edge from the plaintiff, namely the product now described in the plaintiff's patent, and that they had made such purchases prior to the time the plaintiff says its product was invented, on cross-examination they were considerably less certain as to the precise product they had first bought. These witnesses were sincere and have no apparent interest in the outcome of this case, but I cannot attach a great deal of weight to evidence of events of over nine years ago concerning questions which could not, by their nature, have been of great importance to them at the time.\n[27]\nIt must be recognized that there are weaknesses in the plaintiff's contentions as to the date of invention and sale of its patented product. As noted, the available documents are capable of more than one interpretation. Further, it is strange, and worthy of comment, that in response to requests from the defendant during discovery the plaintiff was unable to locate any of its production documents, quality control documents, or purchase orders relating to the production or sale of its door edge for the period January 1, 1976, to March 26, 1977. The only explanation which it gave, on discovery, was that it believes such documents were lost or destroyed at the time of its move to new premises on May 11, 1978. No evidence was called at the trial to confirm, explain, or elaborate on this response. One cannot help but be struck by the complete lack of such documents in the plaintiff's files and the coincidence that these would be documents highly relevant to this litigation.\n[28]\nBe that as it may, the burden is on the defendant to prove on a balance of probabilities the allegations in its counter-claim of invalidity through prior sale by the plaintiff, and I am not satisfied that it has met that burden.\n[29]\n(c) Covetousness - The defendant alleges that the claims of the patent go beyond what was invented. Having regard to my finding above that there was no invention, it is unnecessary for me to consider this question further.\n[30]\nIn support of its allegation of covetousness, the defendant sought to put in evidence the U.S. patent obtained later by the plaintiff for the same subject-matter, with a view to showing that in the U.S. patent the plaintiff had used more restrictive language in the claims. It was said that this at least put an onus on the plaintiff to explain why different language was used in the U.S. claims. As it is unnecessary for me to consider further the question of covetousness it is also unnecessary to consider further the admissibility or effect of such evidence.\nCosts\n[31]\nI have concluded that no costs should be awarded to either party. While the plaintiff has failed to make out its claim due to the invalidity of its patent and the defendant has to that extent succeeded, a very substantial part of the trial was devoted to the defendant's allegation that the patent was invalid because the plaintiff had sold its \"invention\" for more than two years prior to filing its patent application. This allegation was not proved. A substantial part of the costs of the action are attributable to this allegation in the counter-claim. Under the circumstances, I do not think either party is entitled to costs.\nAction dismissed.\nEditor: Steven C. McMinniman/sms\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nStrayer, J.\n: This is an action for infringement in respect of Canadian patent 1,081,733 for a \"Pliable Edge Protector\", of which the plaintiff is assignee. The defendant denies infringement in respect of two claims of the patent, and by its defence and counter-claim alleges as well that the patent is invalid. Invalidity is alleged on the basis of: lack of invention, both on the grounds that the subject of the patent was obvious and that it did not represent a new \"combination\" but rather an \"aggregation\" of known devices giving known results; anticipation, by prior use and sale by others in a manner making such product available to the public, by prior publication, and by sale in Canada by the plaintiff of the same product more than two years prior to its application for a patent; and \"covetousness\", i.e., that the claims are broader than the alleged invention described in the disclosures of the patent.\nBackground Facts\n\n[2]\nThe \"Pliable Edge Protector\" in question is largely used for the purpose of protecting car door edges although it may be used on other thin edges on cars, boats, furniture, etc. The principal demand for the type of product in question here, whether made by the plaintiff or the defendant, appears to be in the \"after-market\" in respect of cars: that is, it is sold to private owners of cars for adding to their vehicles, rather than to manufacturers for installation as original equipment.\n\n[3]\nThe claims of patent '733 are as follows:\n\"1. A pliable edge protector comprising:\na) an elongated extruded channelar member formed of pliable material, said extruded channelar member having a bight portion and a pair of spaced-apart flange portions projecting therefrom to form an interior throat therebetween;\nb) a decorative elongated strip of thin material, said decorative elongated strip having two major surfaces and two minor edge surfaces extending along the length of the decorative strip, one of said major surfaces covering the exterior surface of said extruded channelar member and extending over the projecting ends of said flange portions to thereby dispose said minor edge surfaces within said interior throat; and\n\"2. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1, said pliable material being a soft polyvinyl chloride.\n\"3. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1 wherein said decorative elongated strip comprises a film of polyvinyl chloride having: (i) a decorative coating on the other of said major surfaces thereof, and (ii) a film of transparent weather-resistant material covering said decorative coating and said other of said major surfaces.\n\"4. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 3, said pliable material being a soft polyvinyl chloride.\n\"5. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 4, said decorative coating comprising aluminum.\n\"6. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 1, 2, or 5, said adhesive means comprising a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive extending along the length of the interior surface of said bight portion.\n\"7. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 5, said adhesive means comprising a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive extending along the length of said bight portion, said edge protector being sufficiently pliable to be bent without kinking into a circle having a diameter less than three inches at an ambient temperature of 70\no\nF.\n\"8. A pliable edge protector as set forth in claim 7, said diameter being no greater than two inches.\"\n\n[4]\nReproduced below is figure 4 from the patent which purports to depict in enlarged form a section of the patented door edge protector with the edge of a door 5 inserted into it. (While I do not resort to the drawings to interpret the claims, this figure provides a useful means of describing a common application of the patent.)\n[Figure omitted. See original source.]\nThe core material 8 consists of a pliable polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The thick part at the bend in the \"U\" shape, numbered 8b, is referred to as the \"bight\". The arms or flanges on each side of that bend are numbered 8f. When manufactured there is a bead of glue placed on the bight at the bottom of the channel. When the door edge is installed on a car door, as depicted in figure 4, the glue which is supposed to remain tacky spreads around the car door edge in the manner depicted as 13 in figure 4. The moulding is wrapped in a decorative strip compendiously labelled 9 in the drawing. This decorative strip consists of a film of polyvinyl chloride 10, a thin metallic foil 11, and a covering of a transparent weather-resistant material 12, usually polyester. Decorative material such as 9 can be readily purchased in quantity by makers of door edge and other trims; a common form of 9 is \"Tedlar\". Another commonly available form of decorative material is \"Mylar\" although as I understand it this is not used normally for exterior surfaces.\n\n[5]\nThere are many historical interconnections among the parties and principal witnesses in this case. Several of them appear to have had their beginnings in the car trim business in Canada working for Creators Canada Limited which, until it ceased operation in June, 1981 was a major producer of automotive and furniture trim. Cesare Cosentino, one of the inventors of patent '733, formerly a shareholder of the plaintiff company but now completely out of it and a subpoenaed witness for the defendant, started at Creators Canada in 1968. During some or all of the same period Christopher Hatzikelis (another inventor of patent '733 and a witness for the plaintiff) worked there as well, as did Bogden Ivic, a witness for the defendant in this case. Hatzikelis was general foreman and developer of products at Creators Canada and Cosentino started there as an apprentice. Bogden Ivic worked there during this period in the tool room, engaged in the making of dies, tools and machinery for manufacturing plastic products. Cosentino and Hatzikelis left Creators Canada in 1972 to join others in establishing the plaintiff company Crila. Bogden Ivic left Creators in 1973 and subsequently worked for both the plaintiff and the defendant. Meanwhile Nicola Lattanzio, who appeared as an expert witness for the defendant in this case, commenced working at Creators in 1972 and continued there until 1981.\n\n[6]\nCrila was established for the manufacture of plastic mouldings and trims. The founders were joined in 1973 by Ciro Madonia (another of the inventors of patent '733). Eventually Cosentino was general manager, Hatzikelis was production manager, and Madonia was sales manager of Crila. In the mid-70's Crila was making, among many other mouldings, a \"J\" shaped PVC moulding, with a two-sided adhesive tape attached to it, for use as a door edge for cars. This was the kind of door edge common in the market at that time but was not particularly satisfactory: it was not sufficiently flexible for going around curves in the configuration of a door edge, and was generally difficult to install. Eventually - and the approximate dates are in dispute - Crila developed a \"U\" shaped PVC core door edge, with double-sided adhesive tape inside the \"U\" for attachment to doors. This was ultimately developed further by using as adhesive, instead of tape, a bead of \"hot-melt\" glue inside the channel on the bight, the latter form of the moulding being the subject of the patent in question. During this period of development, some time after the first \"U\" shaped mouldings were made with tape adhesive, Crila also commenced to wrap the decorative layer or \"bright work\" around the flanges of the \"U\" and folded its edges into the inside of the channel as depicted in figure 4 above. This was done for the purpose of better protecting the decorative covering, which otherwise was susceptible to peeling where its minor edges were exposed to damage from weather, carwash equipment, bumps, etc. The evidence disclosed that one of the advantages of the patented product (put in as Exhibit P-7B) over earlier door edges, such as the \"J\" shaped moulding, was its pliability. It could be bent readily around corners of a fairly small radius without kinking. This was achieved by the particular hardness of PVC chosen by Crila for the core of this moulding. This pliability gave the moulding less resilience or gripping power which was compensated for by the use of effective adhesives.\n\n[7]\nOne of the matters in dispute is as to when the final version of the product was first produced (i.e. \"invented\") and sold by Crila. Certain witnesses for the defendant stated that this must have been in the autumn of 1976, whereas certain witnesses for the plaintiff indicated it was in the fall of 1977. This is an important question as the patent was not applied for until March 26, 1979. If the first sales to the public were more than two years prior to this application (i.e., before March 26, 1977) then by virtue of s. 28(1)(c) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, the patent should not have been issued.\n\n[8]\nJohn Mandino, now president of the defendant company which is alleged to have infringed the plaintiff's patent, first gained experience in the plastic manufacturing business by working for the plaintiff. He worked there for a short time in 1973, and then again during the summer of 1976 full time, part-time during the academic year of 1976-77 while he was attending York University, and again during the summer of 1977 full time until August 11th of that year. During 1976 and 1977 he worked both in shipping and in fabrication. He left in August, 1977 in order to establish the defendant company along with members of his family. The defendant company commenced by making other kinds of car trim but, according to Mandino, they first produced and sold in Canada in the fall of 1978 the allegedly infringing door edge which was put in evidence as P-7C. In appearance thos door edge seems virtually identical to the door edge depicted in the plaintiff's patent. In fact the defendant does not deny that its product P-7C infringes claims 1 to 6 of the patent. It does deny that this door edge infringed claims 7 and 8, which claims are with respect to a door edge that is sufficiently pliable to be bent without kinking into a circle with a diameter less than three inches (claim 7) or with a diameter of two inches (claim 8). Since the commencement of this action, the defendant company in 1982 changed its door edge by spreading the hot-melt glue around the whole of the inside of the channel rather than confining it to a bead on the bight. A sample of this modified door edge was put in evidence as Exhibit D-28. This change was not pleaded and it appears to me that it can have no relevance except, perhaps, on the question of remedies.\n\n[9]\nIt is also interesting to note that Bogden Ivic, who worked for Crila periodically between 1975 and May, 1977, subsequently made dies and other equipment for the defendant company including, apparently, the die for the manufacture of the defendant's allegedly infringing product. He says that he made a die for the plaintiff's U-shaped moulding before leaving Crila in May, 1977.\n\n[10]\nThe patent was registered on July 15, 1980. By an assignment dated the same day, the inventors, Hatzikelis, Madonia, and Cosentino assigned to the plaintiff Crila Plastic Industries Limited their rights in the patent. In the meantime Cosentino had left Crila to work for a subsidiary or associated company which he subsequently left in 1981 and eventually severed all ties with Crila. His departure was obviously not amicable. Hatzikelis left Crila in 1985.\nConclusions\n1. Infringement\n\n[11]\nAs noted above, the defendant by its statement of defence only denies infringement with respect to two claims, 7 and 8. This denial as pleaded relates solely to the question of the ability of the defendant's product to be bent into a circle with a diameter of less than three inches without kinking.\n\n[12]\nI am satisfied that the defendant's product comes within claims 7 and 8. First, there is a dispute over the meaning of the word \"kinking\". This is not a word with a well-defined meaning at least in this context. I believe I am therefore at liberty to look at the disclosures to see how the word is used in the patent. At page 3, lines 4 and 5 thereof, the verb \"to kink\" is defined for the purposes of the patent as \"to experience an abrupt and often irreversible change in its (i.e., an edge protector's) curvature\". The other issue in dispute is as to the meaning of the requirement in claim 7, also incorporated by reference in claim 8, that the edge protector be sufficiently pliable \"to be bent ... into a circle\" having a certain diameter. Evidence was given to demonstrate that while the edge protectors of both the plaintiff and the defendant could be bent into such a circle \"in the air\", i.e., without regard to the plane or angle of the \"throat\" of the trim, and that while both could be bent so that the \"throat\" would fit smoothly over an edge with a convex curve of small diameters, there was arguably \"kinking\" when the defendant's edge protector was forced to follow a concave curve of some 2 5/16 inches in diameter. It appears to me, however, that the language of claim 7 (also adopted by reference in claim 8) is clear and understandable in not requiring that the edge protector be fitted on a door edge or other edge in order to pass the test set out in that claim. All that is required is that it be capable of being \"bent without kinking into a circle\". There is no qualification in the test as to the need to follow an edge in bending the material into a circle and, the meaning otherwise being clear, I see no basis for reading such a requirement into the claim. Such a test, while perhaps not the most useful for the purpose, is a measure of the pliability of the moulding which is one of its essential features. I therefore find that the defendant's product as exemplified in Exhibit P-7C infringes all eight claims of patent 1,081,733.\n\n[13]\nThe evidence disclosed that commencing in 1982 the defendant had modified its edge protector so as to spread the pressure-sensitive adhesive up the inside of the flanges as well as having it in the bight. This change was apparently made some time after March, 1982 when the examination for discovery of the defendant took place. This change was never pleaded in the statement of defence nor did counsel for the defendant seek an amendment at the trial in this respect. The new product was put in as Exhibit D-28 and counsel for the defendant argued that this product, at least, did not infringe because claims 6 and 7 (8 being dependent on 7) refer to a \"bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive\" extending along the length of the bight. Counsel argued that the hot-melt glue used in D-28 is not a \"bead\" but is rather a \"layer\" of glue, and is not located just in the bight as these claims contemplate but is spread over the interior surface of the flanges as well as of the bight. I do not accept the defendant's contention in this regard. In the first place, claim 1(c) of the patent refers to \"adhesive means disposed on the interior surface of said channelar member ...\". That description is broad enough to cover literally the defendant's product D-28. Apart from that in my view D-28 infringes the substance of claims 6, 7 and 8 with respect to pressure-sensitive adhesive. I am satisfied that the essential feature of such adhesive is that it be located in the bight and environs. It was not disputed that, when a door which is inserted into such an edge protector, the bead spreads around that door edge and no doubt extends part way up the interior surfaces of the flanges. If one looks at a section of D-28, it is obvious that the bulk of the pressure-sensitive adhesive there is also still in the bight with a thinner amount spread up the flanges. That the defendant's product may achieve a greater utilization of adhesive on the flanges does not detract from the fact that it is utilizing a substantial amount of the adhesive in the bight just as contemplated by claims 6, 7 and 8 of the patent. To the extent, then, that this issue might be relevant in any future proceedings, it is my finding that the defendant's product D-28 has infringed and is infringing all of the claims of the patent.\n2. Validity\n\n[14]\n(a) Lack of invention - This issue has two aspects in the present case: the defendant says that the claims of the patent involve substances or devices that were obvious at the date of application of the patent, and that their association by the patent does not amount to an inventive \"combination\" of known substances but rather an \"aggregation\".\n\n[15]\nI am satisfied that the various elements brought together by the claims of the patent were obvious. As I understand it, the essential features of the \"invention\" as claimed by the plaintiff include: the use of a relatively flexible or pliable U-shaped moulding material (I accept that the reference to \"a pair of spaced-apart flange portions ...\" in claim 1 means a U-shaped moulding); the use of a decorative strip on the outside (with or without a protective coating over it) which is wrapped around the flanges and into the throat of the moulding; and some kind of adhesive inside the moulding (seemingly including double-edged tape, a layer of pressure-sensitive glue or a bead of hot-melt pressure-sensitive glue in the bight).\n\n[16]\nThese various elements can be found in some of the prior art pleaded by the defendant, all of which precede this \"invention\" by many years. The U-shaped configuration for an edge cover can be found in the following patents: Shanok (U.S. 2,928,201) (D-3.2); Kimbark (D-3.1); Bono (D-3.3); Shanok (U.S. 3,547,516) (D-3.6); Shanok (U.S. 3,517,515) (D-3.7); Kellos (D-3.8); and Weimar (D-3.11). The use of material such as PVC is described in the Hearn patent (D-3.10), as is the use of a decorative cover such as Mylar and the advantages of protecting the minor edge of such decorative covering, in this case by burying it. The use of a pressure-sensitive adhesive to hold on such edge protectors is described in the Kunevicius (D-3.4) and Kellos (D-3.8) patents and the use of beads of tacky adhesive inside the channel is specifically described in the first Shanok patent (U.S. 2,928,201) (D-3.2).\n\n[17]\nEvidence as to general knowledge of those skilled in the art further confirms that the essential elements of the plaintiff's claims were previously known. There was evidence that pliable PVC had been used as a basic material for decorative and protective mouldings, for example by Creators Canada, for many years before this patent was applied for. Decorative strips to cover such mouldings had been available since at least 1972 and the bonding of them to PVC mouldings had been a known technique since at least that time. U-shaped trims such as Silvatrim (P-7A) had been on the market for many years and is in fact referred to as prior art in the patent in issue in this suit. The idea of wrapping the protective covering around a moulding so that the minor edges of that covering would not be exposed once the moulding or trim was installed had been known at least as early as 1972 at Creators Canada. (See, e.g., D-17). The use of adhesives to hold on trim had been known for many years and in particular the use of a hot-melt adhesive such as that contemplated in claims 6, 7 and 8 had been known from at least 1974 onward. As noted above, even the Shanok (U.S. 2,928,201) patent of 1960 (D-3.2) contemplated the use of \"beads\" of a \"tacky, deformable adhesive substance\". Most significantly, D-10, a trim which according to Mr. Lattanzio was in use at Creators Canada prior to his arrival there in 1972, had virtually all of the features covered by the claims of the patent. It was a pliable moulding covered by a decorative strip which was wrapped around the outside of the moulding and extended into the interior so as to be covered when the moulding was installed. An adhesive was used inside the moulding, a tape which would not come within claims 6-8 but could come within claim 1. This moulding arguably differed only with respect to its configuration. It was capable of being bent into a U-shape - and according to Mr. Lattanzio it was used at least sometimes in that shape, including use by some employees to decorate their car doors. This moulding must have been well-known to all or most of the principals of the plaintiff company, having regard to the fact that several people involved at Crila had worked earlier at Creators Canada. More importantly these and other PVC mouldings having been on the market for some years must have been also well-known to those interested in this kind of product and therefore can be regarded as within common general knowledge.\n\n[18]\nThe question remains, however, as to whether by putting together all of these well-known elements the applicants for the patent had produced a \"combination\" which was inventive. The defendant argues that this was merely an \"aggregation\" of known elements, each of which continued to perform its well-known function without any new result flowing from the interaction of two or more known elements. I respectfully adopt the legal tests applied by my colleague Collier, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . After reviewing the established authorities on the subject he stated at pages 189-90:\n\"Mere juxtaposition of parts is insufficient for patentability. The elements must combine for a unitary result. If any element in the arrangement gives its own result, without any result flowing from the combination, then there is no invention.\"\nAfter reviewing the elements said to form the invention, he concluded at page 191:\n\"... In my opinion the elements I have above outlined perform essentially independent functions. They do not collate to produce a new but common result. If any one of them were removed, the others, in my mind, would continue to perform their own individual function. There is here an aggregation, not a combination.\"\nI believe that is the situation in the present case. The U-shaped moulding continues to be a means of covering an edge. The more pliable it is the more easily it follows the contours of the edge. The decorative layer continues to decorate, and the \"wrap-around\" feature of it continues to protect it. The adhesive inside continues to attach one object to another. While there was some suggestion in evidence and argument of the advantage of the closed throat in keeping glue from drying before installation, and of the combined effect of the shape of the moulding, the wrap-around feature and the glue in keeping out water after installation, these advantages are not claimed by the patent.\n\n[19]\nI considered carefully the possibility that the use of a moulding that is pliable (thus enabling it to follow the contours, but reducing its gripping power) is made more feasible by the use of glue (providing the gripping effect which is lost through greater pliability), and that these two features together could amount to a combination. This advantage is neither specifically disclosed nor claimed in the patent. Moreover, I have concluded that all this \"combination\" really amounts to is a decision to use glue to stick on something which otherwise would not grip. It involves the workman deciding that \"if it won't stay in place, we should put some glue on it\". This hardly seems to me to be the \"scintilla of inventiveness\" which is the minimum requirement for an invention. Nor do I think a decision as to the location of the glue, moving the \"bead\" from the flanges to the bight, for example, is even a small flash of inventive genius. The glue itself was a commonly known product.\n\n[20]\nI therefore conclude that the claims of the patent do not disclose an invention.\n\n[21]\n(b) Anticipation - The defendant alleges anticipation of the patent on three different grounds: that the invention was known or used by others first, that it was described in other patents more than two years before the patent in question was applied for, and that the plaintiff had itself used and sold the invention in Canada for more than two years prior to its application for the patent in question.\n\n[22]\nThe first contention is based in s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act. This must be read with s. 63(1)(a) of the Act which requires that for anticipation by prior use or knowledge by others, the invention must have been disclosed so that it had become available to the public prior to the date of the patent application. The evidence here was very sketchy and mostly consisted of testimony by Bogden Ivic that he had made such a product in Yugoslavia which was sold there. His evidence was far from specific and I was not satisfied from his description that the product was the same as the \"invention\". The defendant also pleaded such prior knowledge or use by the inventors of the patents pleaded as prior art. For reasons to be discussed below I do not think any of the said prior art pecisely anticipated this invention. Further, the defendant pleaded sales by the plaintiff to third parties as a basis for a claim that such third parties had known, used, and made available to the public the invention before the application for the patent. I do not accept this as a proper basis for invoking s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act. That paragraph surely must be interpreted as applying only to knowledge or use of the invention by a person other than the inventor by means other than obtaining the knowledge or the product from the inventor himself. Section 28(1)(a) applies only where the invention was \"known or used by any other person before he (the inventor) invented it\". This is the first requirement for declaring invalid a patent on this ground. The second requirement is that set out in s. 63(1)(a) of the Patent Act which says that the invention known or used by the other person must have been made available to the public prior to the date of application for the patent. The first requirement can obviously not be met through knowledge gained from the inventor, because it assumes that that knowledge has been obtained before the invention takes place. Further, to construe the section as implied by the defendant's pleadings would render meaningless s. 28(1)(c) which allows an inventor, or another person, up to two years of sales in Canada after the invention is made and prior to the filing of an application for a patent, without loss of the right of the inventor to obtain a patent. See also  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 66-67.\n\n[23]\nThe defendant further alleges anticipation by prior publication in eleven patents which are pleaded as prior art and all of which were issued more than two years before the application for the plaintiff's patent. Such a plea is based on s. 28(1)(b) of the Patent Act. It is well settled that for anticipation by prior publication there must be a single document which would give a skilled workman what he would have needed to produce without difficulty the invention allegedly anticipated by it. It must correspond so closely that, had the patent issued prior to that document, the document would have described an \"invention\" infringing the patent. See generally the authorities quoted in the Corning Glass case supra at 63-64. I have examined the patents pleaded here as anticipation and can find none of them which meets these tests. Each has substantial differences from the patent in suit. I therefore find no anticipation of patent 1,081,733 by prior publication.\n\n[24]\nThe more difficult issue is raised by the defendant's allegation that the plaintiff had put its invention to public use and on sale in Canada for more than two years prior to the date of its application for the patent, thereby precluding valid registration due to the provisions of s. 28(1)(c) of the Patent Act. The patent was applied for on March 26, 1979, so this raises the question as to whether the plaintiff sold its product in Canada prior to March 26, 1977. A large part of the trial was devoted to this question and there was much conflicting evidence. The principal witnesses for the defendant in this respect were John Mandino, Vice-President of the defendant company, and Cesare Cosentino, one of the inventors who applied for patent 1,081,733 and upon its issue assigned his rights to the plaintiff. He had also been an officer of the plaintiff company and had left it, all as described earlier. These and other witnesses generally supported the view that the development of the U-shaped door edge at Crila had commenced as soon as perhaps the end of 1975 or at the latest in early 1976, that it had gone through a stage where a door edge was produced using double-sided tape in the interior as an adhesive, with experiments during the summer using hot-melt glue instead which culminated in the fall of 1976 in production and sale of the door edge with hot-melt glue as the adhesive. Numerous documents were introduced by the defendant to support this version of events but unfortunately most of the documents proved to be quite ambiguous. For its part the plaintiff's main witnesses as to the timing were Christopher Hatzikelis, also one of the inventors and assignors of the patent and a former officer of the plaintiff, together with Casey August, the patent agent who advised the inventors and submitted their application for the patent. Their evidence was to the effect that the U-shaped moulding with a Tedlar covering that did not wrap around was first developed in April, 1977, at Crila; that it was probably marketed in this form with a double-sided tape inside as the adhesive, that experiments were undertaken during the summer using hot-melt glue; and that by the fall of 1977 a satisfactory product using hot-melt glue and wrap-around Tedlar had been developed which was subsequently put into production and offered for sale.\n\n[25]\nAfter reviewing the oral evidence and the documents I am not satisfied that the defendant has discharged the burden of proof on it to establish, on a balance of probabilities, sale by the plaintiff of its patented product prior to March 26, 1977. With respect to the documents, all of which are open to more than one interpretation, I find no persuasive reason for preferring the defendant's interpretation. In respect to Exhibit D-19 it appears to me, in combination with Mr. Hatzikelis' testimony, to be strongly supportive of the plaintiff's version, namely that the first hot-melt machine was rented in July, 1977 and then purchased in September, 1977. This is consistent with production and sales having commenced in the fall of 1977 well after the critical date of March 26, 1977. As for the witnesses, I found Mr. Hatzikelis to be clear and forthright at the trial. As one who no longer has any interest in the plaintiff company but who apparently left it on amicable terms, he had no apparent interest in the success or failure of the plaintiff's suit. His evidence and the plaintiff's version of the facts was strongly corroborated in certain respects by the evidence of Mr. August, the patent agent. His evidence, and his \"Time Sheet\" with respect to work done for Crila, put in as Exhibit P-24, clearly indicate that he met with Crila officials in June of 1978 to discuss the possibility of applying for a patent for the new door edge. I am satisfied from his evidence that he would have raised the question of when sales first commenced, and if he had been told that this had occurred as early as the summer of 1976, as the defendant contends, there would presumably either have been a rush to file an application or a decision not to file any at all. Instead, it was some nine months later before the application was filed. Mr. August's view of events is supported by Exhibit P-20, a letter from Mr. Cosentino on behalf of Crila advising Mr. August, obviously in response to an inquiry from the latter, that \"there was a product in the field by November 21, 1977\". Mr. Cosentino's explanation of this I did not find convincing.\n\n[26]\nInsofar as the defendant's witnesses are concerned, I am not prepared to put as much weight on Mr. Cosentino's testimony as he obviously left Crila as a result of contention which may well have affected his testimony. Further, it was clear that he was not directly involved in production at Crila, at least at the critical times. He was not very knowledgeable as to what machines, including hot-melt machines, were on the premises. As for Mr. Mandino, the other principal witness for the defendant on the question of date of first production and sale, he is vitally interested in the outcome of this litigation as Vice-President of the defendant company. He was employed by the plaintiff during the periods of 1976 and 1977 and testified from knowledge gained in that way. He clearly had no overall responsibilities in the plaintiff's establishment. He freely admits to having copied the plaintiff's product and now seeks to avoid liability for infringement by proving that the plaintiff had sold its product publicly for more than two years before it applied for the patent. I must weigh his evidence having these facts in mind. Mr. Bogden Ivic was quite forthcoming and straight forward. The principal evidence he gave relevant to this question was to the effect that he had developed a die for Crila suitable for making U-shaped moulding and that he had done this by early 1976. I have not attached very much weight to this evidence as it is clear that Mr. Ivic had made many dies for many manufacturers of plastic over many years. It was far from clear, if he did make such a die for Crila at that time, that it was the one used to produce the patented product. Certainly Mr. Hatzikelis, who was more directly responsible for the development of this moulding, gave evidence inconsistent with that of Mr. Ivic. Other witnesses called by the defendant included Mr. Chappell Boulton and Mr. Hiram Smith, both of whom had been retail users of the patented door edge. While initially certain that they had purchased only one kind of door edge from the plaintiff, namely the product now described in the plaintiff's patent, and that they had made such purchases prior to the time the plaintiff says its product was invented, on cross-examination they were considerably less certain as to the precise product they had first bought. These witnesses were sincere and have no apparent interest in the outcome of this case, but I cannot attach a great deal of weight to evidence of events of over nine years ago concerning questions which could not, by their nature, have been of great importance to them at the time.\n\n[27]\nIt must be recognized that there are weaknesses in the plaintiff's contentions as to the date of invention and sale of its patented product. As noted, the available documents are capable of more than one interpretation. Further, it is strange, and worthy of comment, that in response to requests from the defendant during discovery the plaintiff was unable to locate any of its production documents, quality control documents, or purchase orders relating to the production or sale of its door edge for the period January 1, 1976, to March 26, 1977. The only explanation which it gave, on discovery, was that it believes such documents were lost or destroyed at the time of its move to new premises on May 11, 1978. No evidence was called at the trial to confirm, explain, or elaborate on this response. One cannot help but be struck by the complete lack of such documents in the plaintiff's files and the coincidence that these would be documents highly relevant to this litigation.\n\n[28]\nBe that as it may, the burden is on the defendant to prove on a balance of probabilities the allegations in its counter-claim of invalidity through prior sale by the plaintiff, and I am not satisfied that it has met that burden.\n\n[29]\n(c) Covetousness - The defendant alleges that the claims of the patent go beyond what was invented. Having regard to my finding above that there was no invention, it is unnecessary for me to consider this question further.\n\n[30]\nIn support of its allegation of covetousness, the defendant sought to put in evidence the U.S. patent obtained later by the plaintiff for the same subject-matter, with a view to showing that in the U.S. patent the plaintiff had used more restrictive language in the claims. It was said that this at least put an onus on the plaintiff to explain why different language was used in the U.S. claims. As it is unnecessary for me to consider further the question of covetousness it is also unnecessary to consider further the admissibility or effect of such evidence.\nCosts\n\n[31]\nI have concluded that no costs should be awarded to either party. While the plaintiff has failed to make out its claim due to the invalidity of its patent and the defendant has to that extent succeeded, a very substantial part of the trial was devoted to the defendant's allegation that the patent was invalid because the plaintiff had sold its \"invention\" for more than two years prior to filing its patent application. This allegation was not proved. A substantial part of the costs of the action are attributable to this allegation in the counter-claim. Under the circumstances, I do not think either party is entitled to costs.\nAction dismissed.\nEditor: Steven C. McMinniman/sms\n[End of document]",

      "The court invalidated the patent due to a lack of invention, finding the combination of elements in the claimed invention was obvious and represented an 'aggregation' rather than an inventive 'combination' of known components.

The court specifically noted prior art demonstrating U-shaped mouldings, pliable PVC, decorative strips, and adhesive applications.",
      "The court rejected the defendant's arguments regarding anticipation by prior use, prior publication, and the plaintiff's own prior sales, finding insufficient evidence to establish prior public availability of the identical invention. It narrowly interpreted s. 28(1)(a) of the Patent Act to exclude knowledge gained directly from the inventor.",
      "Regarding the allegation of prior sales by the plaintiff exceeding the two-year limit before the patent application, the court found the defendant failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that sales occurred before March 26, 1977. It weighed the credibility of witnesses and considered the lack of supporting documentation from the plaintiff, but ultimately determined the burden of proof was not met.",
