    "[1]\nMandamin, J.\n: The Applicant, Mr. Jean Claude Nzayisenga, applies for judicial review of the June 24, 201l decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD).",
    "[2]\nThe RPD refused the Applicant's claim for refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the\nAct\n. The RPD determined that the Applicant is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.",
    "[3]\nI conclude for reasons that follow that the application should be dismissed.\nBackground",
    "[4]\nThe Applicant, Jean Claude Nzayisenga, was born in Rwanda to a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother. He lived with his grandparents while he attended primary school. When the genocide in Rwanda started in 1994, a neighbour of his grandparents, Alphonse Buregeya, came and took the Applicant's grandparents away. The Applicant's grandparents were Tutsis and Seventh Day Adventists and were killed by the men who took them away.",
    "[5]\nThe Applicant rejoined his parents in Karambi, about five kilometres away. Later in 1994, Hutu neighbours came to the home and beat him and his mother.",
    "[6]\nAfter the genocide, the Applicant's parents denounced Mr. Buregeya who was imprisoned awaiting trial. In April, 2008, Mr. Buregeya appeared in the Gacaca court of Rwanda. The Applicant was summoned to testify which he did on May 12 and May 19, 2008. Mr. Buregeya was sentenced to 15 years in jail for his part in the genocide.",
    "[7]\nOn May 20, 2008, the Applicant was attacked by three men wearing masks. The Applicant was left unconscious on the side of the road. He was in hospital for about four days.",
    "[8]\nThe Applicant returned to the university he had been attending where he began receiving threatening calls on his cell phone. His parents also received calls on their home phone from unidentified men looking for the Applicant.",
    "[9]\nLater that year the Applicant received an internship to work with RiskMetric Group in the United States; the Applicant left Rwanda on October 8, 2008 for the United States.",
    "[10]\nOn December 27, 2008, the Applicant came to Quebec and made a refugee claim. The Applicant claims to fear Mr. Buregeya and his family.\nDecision Under Review",
    "[11]\nThe RPD found the Applicant was not a Convention refugee because he did not have a well founded fear of persecution in Rwanda and was not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Rwanda would not subject him personally to risk of harm. The RPD determinative issues were the nature of the harm the Applicant feared and the existence of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA).",
    "[12]\nThe RPD accepted the Applicant testified against Mr. Buregeya in the Gacaca Court and was beaten by unknown men following the trial. The RPD also accepted that the Applicant received threatening phone calls on his cell number from unidentified persons. The RPD also found that the last time his parents heard from anyone looking for the Applicant was approximately eight months before the RPD hearing.",
    "[13]\nThe RPD considered the current country conditions in Rwanda. The RPD noted the Rwandan government follow-up to the Gacaca Courts took measures to protect and improve the situation of the genocide survivors and witnesses.",
    "[14]\nThe RPD also found the documentary evidence did not corroborate the subjective fear the Applicant claimed. There were no reports of organized groups targeting genocide witnesses. The RPD found that 156 genocide survivors and witnesses were killed between 1995 and 2008 but this percentage was very low considering more than 1.2 million cases were heard in the Gacaca Courts. The RPD also noted that the documentary evidence showed that there had been major improvements in the previous year alone and that the fact that some people had been killed does not show an absence of state protection.",
    "[15]\nThe RPD found that that the Applicant's fear of persecution under s. 96 was not objectively well-founded on a forward-looking assessment.",
    "[16]\nIn regards to the s. 97 claim the RPD noted that the Applicant's parents still lived in the same place and that, although they were initially told that they would be harmed if they did not tell the caller about their son, this had not occurred. The RPD found the Rwandan government had taken significant steps to assist citizens of Rwanda after the genocide, and the Claimant's family had not been further contacted.",
    "[17]\nIn the alternative, the RPD also considered an internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Applicant. It set out the test for determining the existence of an IFA set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and then considered Kigali as a viable IFA.",
    "[18]\nThe RPD accepted that Rwanda is a small country, but stated that Kigali has a population of approximately one million people. The RPD decided there would be work opportunities for the Applicant in Kigali. The RPD also noted the Applicant is independent, well educated and does not require the assistance of his parents or family at this point in his life.",
    "[19]\nThe RPD found that the IFA of Kigali is objectively reasonable in all the circumstances.\nRelevant Legislation",
    "[20]\nThe\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 provides:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n...\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them Personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n...\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Refugee Convention or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n...\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\n96. A refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\na) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\n...\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n...\n108. (1) The application for asylum is rejected and the applicant does not have the status of refugee or person in need of protection in any of the following cases:\n...\ne) the reasons which made him request asylum no longer exist.\n...\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply if the applicant proves that there are compelling reasons, relating to persecution, torture or previous treatment or punishment, for refusing to claim the protection of the country he left or outside which he remained.\nIssues",
    "[21]\nThe Applicant raised the following issues:\n1. Did the RPD fail to consider whether the Applicant suffered from cumulative harassment amounting to persecution?\n2. Did the RPD err by not conducting a \"compelling reasons\" analysis under paragraphs 108(1)(e) and 108(4) of\nIRPA\n?\n3. Does consideration of an IFA require a prior finding of a well-founded localized fear of persecution?\nStandard of Review",
    "[22]\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has held in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] that there are only two standards of review: correctness for questions of law and reasonableness involving questions of mixed fact and law and fact. The Supreme Court has also held that where the standard of review has been previously determined, a standard of review analysis need not be repeated.",
    "[23]\nThe RPD's determination of whether incidents of discrimination or harassment amount to persecution is a question of mixed fact and law to be determined on a standard of reasonableness.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLiang\n]",
    "[24]\nQuestions related to the application of section 108(1)(e) and 108(4) are determinations of mixed fact and law and are to be determined on a reasonableness standard.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . [\nLewis\n]",
    "[25]\nAn examination of the RPD's determination regarding the viability of an IFA is also a question of mixed law and fact to be determined on a standard of reasonableness.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]\nAnalysis",
    "[26]\nThe Applicant submits he had been persecuted since his grandparents had been murdered, he and his mother beaten, and he was beaten and hospitalized after he testified in the Gacaca court. The Applicant submits the RPD accepted this testimony but did not specifically address whether the various incidents of mistreatment cumulatively created a well-founded fear of persecution. The Applicant also submits the RPD was required to consider section 108 of\nIRPA\nbecause the preconditions for consideration of compelling reasons were present. Finally, the Applicant submits an IFA analysis requires the RPD to find or assume the existence of a localized well-founded fear of persecution before conducting a proper IFA analysis.\nCumulative Mistreatment",
    "[27]\nThe question of whether the cumulative incidents of mistreatment create a well founded fear of persecution has been addressed by this Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n... The doctrine of cumulative grounds of persecution was summarized by Mr. Justice Nadon, speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal, in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 259. Where evidence establishes a series of actions characterized to be discriminatory, and not persecutory, the cumulative effect of that conduct must be considered. It would be an error of law for the RPD not to consider the cumulative nature of that conduct, as directed against the claimant. The RPD is duty bound to consider all the events which may have an impact on a claimant's submission that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 30",
    "[28]\nIn the case at hand, the RPD considered all of the incidents of mistreatment alleged by the Applicant. While the RPD did not specifically say it had considered the cumulative effect of those incidents, it is clear that the RPD was aware of the totality of the Applicant's allegations.",
    "[29]\nMoreover, the RPD was mindful of the change in circumstances in Rwanda. In my view, the RPD could proceed as it did since the Applicant's claim of fear rests, not on the totality of his experiences, but on the beating and threatening phone calls following his testimony in the Gracaca Court. The RPD decided the Applicant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the event of his return to Rwanda today given government measures to safeguard genocide victims and witnesses.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].",
    "[30]\nThe RPD made no error in its review of these incidents and consideration of the Rwanda government measures to support victims and witnesses. It cannot be said to have failed to consider all the events cumulatively as reviewed all incidents and reasonably assessed the objective basis for the Applicant's fear in light of the relevant circumstances.\nCompelling Reasons",
    "[31]\nGiven the RPD reasonably decided that the Applicant did not have a well founded fear of persecution, the precursors for a compelling reasons analysis under s. 108(4) were not present. Section 108(1) will only apply when the decision maker finds a claimant has a valid claim for refugee protection and then must find the cause of the persecution no longer exists. Only then does the decision maker consider s. 108(4).",
    "[32]\nThis Court has recently had the opportunity to address the application of subsection 108(4). In\nLewis\nat para 43, Justice Scott stated:\n43\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is the leading case. It states that section 108(1)(e) will only apply when the decision maker has made a determination that the person has had a valid claim for refugee protection due to persecution. The decision maker must then find that the cause of that persecution no longer exists. At this point, the decision maker can consider 108(4) and \"...whether the nature of the claimant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he or she should not be expected to return and put himself or herself under the protection of that state\".",
    "[33]\nThis was not a case where the Applicant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he should not be expected to return and put himself under the protection of the state. The RPD did not err for not conducting such an analysis.\nInternal Flight Alternative",
    "[34]\nIn order to qualify for protection under either section 96 or 97, a claimant must face risk in all parts of the country he is fleeing. If there is a part of the country, an IFA, in which the claimant does not face risk, then that claimant does not meet the requirements for protection, irrespective of whether the claimant faces risk in the area that he fled.",
    "[35]\nThis Court has stated that the RPD need not proceed in the manner urged by the Applicant that the RPD must first find or assume the existence of a well-founded fear before conducting an IFA analysis.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 1196 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].",
    "[36]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 7, Justice Snider stated that the RPD, in performing an IFA analysis, is not required to first make a finding that the Applicant faced a localized risk as argued by the Applicant:\nWhen looking at the existence of an IFA,\nthe Board could find that the Applicant faced a risk of persecution in [the area from which he originates\n], the Board could assume (without finally determining the question) that he faced persecution\nor it could ignore the whole question\n. As long as:\n(a) The Board applied the correct test to its IFA analysis; and\n(b) Its conclusions on the existence of an IFA was not patently unreasonable, in the sense that it is unsupported by the evidence;\nIts decision should stand. [Emphasis added, citations omitted]",
    "[37]\nHere, the RPD stated and applied the correct test to its IFA analysis.",
    "[38]\nThe RPD's conclusions were supported by the evidence and fall within the range of reasonable outcomes based on the applicable law and facts. It does not matter that the RPD did not find or assume the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution in the area from which the Applicant originates.",
    "[39]\nThe RPD's IFA determination is reasonable. The Applicant has failed to establish that the RPD has made a reviewable error.\nConclusion",
    "[40]\nThe application for judicial review does not succeed.",
    "[41]\nThe Applicant proposes questions for certification which reflect the issues identified. These questions have already been addressed by ample jurisprudence and I decline to certify the questions.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[42]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question of general importance is certified.\n.........................\nJean Claude Nzayisenga (plaintiff) and The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (respondent)"

It cannot be said to have failed to consider all the events cumulatively as reviewed all incidents and reasonably assessed the objective basis for the Applicant's fear in light of the relevant circumstances.\nCompelling Reasons\n[31]\nGiven the RPD reasonably decided that the Applicant did not have a well founded fear of persecution, the precursors for a compelling reasons analysis under s. 108(4) were not present. Section 108(1) will only apply when the decision maker finds a claimant has a valid claim for refugee protection and then must find the cause of the persecution no longer exists. Only then does the decision maker consider s. 108(4).\n[32]\nThis Court has recently had the opportunity to address the application of subsection 108(4). In\nLewis\nat para 43, Justice Scott stated:\n43\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is the leading case. It states that section 108(1)(e) will only apply when the decision maker has made a determination that the person has had a valid claim for refugee protection due to persecution. The decision maker must then find that the cause of that persecution no longer exists. At this point, the decision maker can consider 108(4) and \"...whether the nature of the claimant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he or she should not be expected to return and put himself or herself under the protection of that state\".\n[33]\nThis was not a case where the Applicant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he should not be expected to return and put himself under the protection of the state. The RPD did not err for not conducting such an analysis.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[34]\nIn order to qualify for protection under either section 96 or 97, a claimant must face risk in all parts of the country he is fleeing. If there is a part of the country, an IFA, in which the claimant does not face risk, then that claimant does not meet the requirements for protection, irrespective of whether the claimant faces risk in the area that he fled.\n[35]\nThis Court has stated that the RPD need not proceed in the manner urged by the Applicant that the RPD must first find or assume the existence of a well-founded fear before conducting an IFA analysis.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 1196 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n[36]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 7, Justice Snider stated that the RPD, in performing an IFA analysis, is not required to first make a finding that the Applicant faced a localized risk as argued by the Applicant:\nWhen looking at the existence of an IFA,\nthe Board could find that the Applicant faced a risk of persecution in [the area from which he originates\n], the Board could assume (without finally determining the question) that he faced persecution\nor it could ignore the whole question\n. As long as:\n(a) The Board applied the correct test to its IFA analysis; and\n(b) Its conclusions on the existence of an IFA was not patently unreasonable, in the sense that it is unsupported by the evidence;\nIts decision should stand. [Emphasis added, citations omitted]\n[37]\nHere, the RPD stated and applied the correct test to its IFA analysis.\n[38]\nThe RPD's conclusions were supported by the evidence and fall within the range of reasonable outcomes based on the applicable law and facts. It does not matter that the RPD did not find or assume the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution in the area from which the Applicant originates.\n[39]\nThe RPD's IFA determination is reasonable. The Applicant has failed to establish that the RPD has made a reviewable error.\nConclusion\n[40]\nThe application for judicial review does not succeed.\n[41]\nThe Applicant proposes questions for certification which reflect the issues identified. These questions have already been addressed by ample jurisprudence and I decline to certify the questions.\nJUDGMENT\n[42]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question of general importance is certified.\n.........................\nJean Claude Nzayisenga (demandeur) et Le Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration (défendeur)\n[1]\nLe juge Mandamin\n[Traduction]: La Cour est saisie de la demande de contrôle judiciaire de M. Jean Claude Nzayisenga visant la décision en date du 24 juin 2011 rendue par la Section de la protection des réfugiés de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la SPR).\n[2]\nLa SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile du demandeur fondée sur l'article 96 et le paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi, concluant que celui-ci n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention ni qualité de personne à protéger.\n[3]\nPour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, j'estime qu'il y a lieu de rejeter la demande.\nContexte\n[4]\nLe demandeur, Jean Claude Nzayisenga, est né au Rwanda d'un père hutu et d'une mère tutsie. Il a vécu avec ses grands-parents pendant qu'il fréquentait l'école primaire. Lorsque le génocide a commencé, en 1994, un voisin de ses grands-parents, Alphonse Buregeya, a emmené ceux-ci. Les grands-parents étaient tutsis et membres de l'Église adventiste du septième jour, et ils ont été tués par les hommes qui les avaient emmenés.\n[5]\nLe demandeur est retourné auprès de ses parents à Karambi, environ 5 kilomètres plus loin. Plus tard en 1994, sa mère et lui ont été battus chez eux par des voisins hutus.\n[6]\nAprès le génocide, les parents du demandeur ont dénoncé M. Buregeya, qui a été emprisonné en attendant l'instruction de son procès, lequel s'est ouvert devant un tribunal gacaca, au Rwanda au mois d'avril 2008. Le demandeur a été cité comme témoin, et il a témoigné les 12 et 19 mai 2008. M. Buregeya a été condamné à 15 ans de prison pour son rôle dans le génocide.\n[7]\nLe 20 mai 2008, le demandeur a été attaqué par trois hommes masqués qui l'ont laissé inconscient au bord de la route. Il a été hospitalisé environ quatre jours.\n[8]\nIl est retourné à l'université qu'il fréquentait, où il a commencé à recevoir des appels de menace à son numéro de téléphone cellulaire. Ses parents ont également reçu chez eux des appels d'hommes non identifiés qui cherchaient le demandeur.\n[9]\nPlus tard dans l'année, le demandeur a été accepté comme stagiaire pour l'entreprise RiskMetric Group aux États-Unis; il est parti du Rwanda le 8 octobre 2008 pour les États-Unis.\n[10]\nLe 27 décembre 2008, il s'est rendu au Québec, et il a présenté une demande d'asile. Il dit craindre M. Buregeya et sa famille.\nDécision soumise au contrôle\n[11]\nLa SPR a estimé que le demandeur n'avait pas qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention car il ne craignait pas avec raison d'être persécuté au Rwanda et qu'il n'avait pas non plus qualité de personne à protéger car son renvoi au Rwanda ne l'exposerait pas personnellement à un risque de préjudice. La SPR a considéré comme questions déterminantes la nature du préjudice redouté et l'existence d'une possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI).\n[12]\nLa SPR a tenu pour avéré que le demandeur avait témoigné contre M. Buregeya au cours d'un procès devant un tribunal gacaca et qu'il avait été battu par des agresseurs inconnus après le procès. Elle a aussi reconnu qu'il avait reçu des appels de menace anonymes à son numéro de téléphone cellulaire. Elle a relevé que la dernière fois que quelqu'un avait demandé aux parents du demandeur où celui-ci se trouvait remontait à huit mois environ avant l'audience devant la SPR.\n[13]\nLa SPR a examiné la situation existant actuellement au Rwanda, et relevé que le gouvernement rwandais avait pris des mesures de suivi de l'activité judiciaire des gacacas visant à protéger les survivants et témoins du génocide et à améliorer leur situation.\n[14]\nLa SPR a estimé que la crainte subjective invoquée par le demandeur n'était pas corroborée par la preuve documentaire. Aucun rapport ne faisait état de groupes organisés prenant des témoins du génocide pour cible. Reconnaissant que 156 survivants ou témoins du génocide avaient été tués entre 1995 et 2008, elle a cependant jugé que, les tribunaux gacacas ayant instruit plus de 1,2 million de procès, il s'agissait là d'un pourcentage très faible. La preuve documentaire démontrait aussi, selon elle, qu'au cours de la seule année qui venait de s'écouler des améliorations importantes avaient été réalisées. Elle a souligné que le fait que des personnes aient été tuées ne démontrait pas que l'État n'offrait pas de protection.\n[15]\nLa SPR a jugé que, considérée dans une perspective prospective, la crainte de persécution requise par l'article 96 n'était pas objectivement fondée.\n[16]\nPour ce qui est de la demande d'asile fondée sur l'article 97, la SPR a fait remarquer que les parents du demandeur vivaient toujours au même endroit et que, bien qu'on les ait menacés de sévices s'ils ne révélaient pas où était leur fils, rien ne s'était produit. La SPR a conclu que le gouvernement rwandais avait pris des mesures importantes pour aider les citoyens après le génocide, et que personne n'avait plus communiqué avec la famille du demandeur.\n[17]\nLa SPR a examiné également, de façon subsidiaire, la question de la possibilité de refuge intérieur (PRI). Après avoir exposé le critère applicable pour statuer sur l'existence d'une PRI, tel qu'il a été formulé dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (CAF) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], elle a examiné la viabilité de la PRI offerte par Kigali.\n[18]\nElle a reconnu que le Rwanda était un petit pays, mais que Kigali comptait cependant un million d'habitants. Elle a estimé que le demandeur jouirait de nombreuses possibilités d'emploi à Kigali, et signalé que le demandeur avait une nature indépendante, était instruit et n'avait plus besoin, à ce stade de sa vie, de l'aide de ses parents et de sa famille.\n[19]\nLa SPR a donc conclu que Kigali offrait une PRI objectivement raisonnable dans les circonstances.\nDispositions législatives applicables\n[20]\nLes dispositions pertinentes de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et le statut de réfugié\n, LC 2001, c 27, sont ainsi conçues.\n96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\na\n) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\nb) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.\n...\n97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:\na\n) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;\nb) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:\n(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,\n(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,\n(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,\n(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.\n...\n108. (1) Est rejetée la demande d'asile et le demandeur n'a pas qualité de réfugié ou de personne à protéger dans tel des cas suivants:\n...\ne) les raisons qui lui ont fait demander l'asile n'existent plus.\n...\n(4) L'alinéa (1)e) ne s'applique pas si le demandeur prouve qu'il y a des raisons impérieuses, tenant à des persécutions, à la torture ou à des traitements ou peines antérieurs, de refuser de se réclamer de la protection du pays qu'il a quitté ou hors duquel il est demeuré.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n...\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them Personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n...\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n...\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\nQuestions en litige\n[21]\nLe demandeur soulève les questions suivantes:\n1. La SPR a-t-elle omis d'évaluer si le demandeur avait été victime d'actes cumulatifs de harcèlement constituant de la persécution?\n2. La SPR a-t-elle commis une erreur en n'effectuant pas d'analyse relative à l'existence de  raisons impérieuses  sous le régime de l'alinéa 108(1)\ne\n) et du par. 108(4) de la LIPR?\n3. Pour examiner s'il y a une PRI, faut-il au préalable avoir conclu que le demandeur craint avec raison d'être persécuté à un endroit donné?\nLa norme de contrôle\n[22]\nSelon l'arrêt\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), de la Cour suprême du Canada, il n'existe que deux normes de contrôle: la norme de la décision correcte pour les questions de droit, et celle de la raisonnabilité pour les questions de fait et les questions mixtes de fait et de droit. La Cour suprême a également jugé que lorsque la norme a déjà été établie pour une question donnée, il n'y a pas lieu de reprendre l'analyse relative à la norme applicable.\n[23]\nLa question de savoir si des actes discriminatoires ou de harcèlement constituent de la persécution est une question mixte de fait et de droit qui appelle l'application de la norme de la raisonnabilité.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLiang\n].\n[24]\nLes conclusions de la SPR en matière d'application de l'alinéa 108(1)\ne\n) et du paragraphe 108(4) sont aussi des questions mixtes de fait et de droit auxquelles s'applique la norme de la raisonnabilité.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLewis\n].\n[25]\nIl en va de même des décisions de la SPR concernant la viabilité d'une PRI, auxquelles s'applique également la norme de la raisonnabilité.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\nAnalyse\n[26]\nLe demandeur se dit victime de persécution parce que ses grands-parents ont été tués, que sa mère et lui ont été battus et qu'il a été battu et hospitalisé après avoir témoigné devant un tribunal gacaca. Il fait valoir que la SPR a accepté son témoignage mais qu'elle n'a pas examiné la question précise de savoir si les divers incidents de mauvais traitements, pris cumulativement, ont créé une crainte fondée de persécution. Il soutient également que la SPR était tenue d'effectuer une analyse relative à l'article 108 de la LIPR parce que les conditions requises pour un examen des raisons impérieuses étaient remplies. Enfin, affirme qu'avant d'examiner la question de la PRI, la SPR doit conclure ou présumer que le demandeur craint avec raison d'être persécuté à un endroit donné.\nAccumulation de mauvais traitements\n[27]\nNotre Cour s'est penchée sur la question de savoir si l'accumulation de mauvais traitements entraîne une crainte fondée de persécution dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n... La doctrine des motifs cumulés de persécution a été résumée par le juge Nadon, s'exprimant au nom de la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'arrêt\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 259. Dans les cas où la preuve établit l'existence d'une série d'actions qui sont considérées comme étant de la discrimination plutôt que de la persécution, il faut tenir compte de la nature cumulative de ces actions. La SPR commettrait une erreur de droit en ne tenant pas compte de la nature cumulative des actions commises contre le demandeur. Elle a l'obligation de tenir compte de tous les faits qui peuvent avoir une incidence sur l'affirmation du demandeur d'asile suivant laquelle il craint avec raison d'être persécuté. [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au para 30]\n[28]\nEn l'espèce, la SPR a pris en compte tous les incidents de mauvais traitements allégués par le demandeur. Bien qu'elle n'ait pas mentionné expressément avoir examiné l'effet cumulatif de ces incidents, il est clair qu'elle était au courant de toutes les allégations formulées par le demandeur.\n[29]\nDe plus, la SPR a tenu compte du changement de situation au Rwanda. Elle pouvait selon moi procéder comme elle l'a fait puisque la crainte invoquée par le demandeur ne repose pas sur la totalité des incidents mais sur l'agression et les appels de menace qui ont suivi son témoignage devant le tribunal gacaca. La SPR a conclu que le demandeur ne serait pas exposé à une possibilité sérieuse de persécution s'il retournait au Rwanda aujourd'hui car le gouvernement avait pris des mesures de protection à l'égard des victimes et témoins du génocide.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n[30]\nLa SPR n'a pas commis d'erreur dans l'examen de ces incidents et des mesures prises par le gouvernement rwandais pour aider les victimes et les témoins. Puisqu'il a examiné tous les incidents et que son appréciation du fondement objectif de la crainte du demandeur à la lumière des circonstances applicables était raisonnable, on ne saurait dire qu'il n'a pas tenu compte de tous les événements de façon cumulative.\nRaisons impérieuses\n[31]\nPuisque la SPR était parvenue à la conclusion raisonnable selon laquelle le demandeur ne craignait pas avec raison d'être persécuté, les conditions exigées pour qu'il y ait analyse des raisons impérieuses sous le régime du paragraphe 108(4) étaient inexistantes. En effet, le paragraphe 108(1) ne s'applique que lorsque le décideur juge la demande d'asile bien fondée; il doit ensuite conclure que la cause de la persécution a cessé d'exister. Ce n'est qu'alors que le paragraphe 108(4) entre en jeu.\n[32]\nNotre Cour a récemment traité de l'application du paragraphe 108(4). Dans\nLewis\n, au paragraphe 43, le juge Scott a indiqué:\n43 La décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> est le précédent qui fait autorité. Il y est dit que l'alinéa 108(1)\ne\n) ne s'applique que dans les cas où le décideur a conclu que la personne avait une demande du statut de réfugié valide pour cause de persécution. Ce décideur doit ensuite conclure que la cause de cette persécution a disparu. À ce stade, il peut prendre en considération le paragraphe 108(4) et  [...] évaluer si la nature des expériences du demandeur dans l'ancien pays était à ce point épouvantable que l'on ne devrait pas s'attendre à ce qu'il ou elle rentre dans son pays et se réclame de la protection de l'État .\n[33]\nNous ne sommes pas en présence d'un cas où ce que le demandeur a vécu dans son pays était si épouvantable qu'on ne saurait s'attendre à ce qu'il y retourne et demande la protection de l'État. La SPR ne s'est pas trompée en ne procédant pas à une telle analyse.\nPossibilité de refuge intérieur\n[34]\nPour avoir droit à la protection prévue aux articles 96 ou 97, le risque auquel le demandeur est exposé doit exister dans la totalité du pays. Si le demandeur n'est pas à risque dans une région, il ne remplit pas les conditions requises pour obtenir asile, qu'il existe ou non un risque dans la région qu'il a fuie.\n[35]\nLe demandeur soutient que la SPR doit d'abord avoir conclu à l'existence d'une crainte fondée ou l'avoir présumée pour effectuer l'analyse relative à la PRI, mais notre Cour a jugé que la SPR n'a pas à procéder ainsi.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 1196 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n[36]\nDans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , la juge Snider a affirmé, au paragraphe 7, que la SPR n'a pas à conclure d'abord qu'un demandeur est exposé à un risque localisé pour examiner la question de la PRI:\nLorsque la Commission s'est demandé si le demandeur disposait d'une PRI,\nelle pouvait conclure qu'il faisait face à un risque de persécution [dans la région d'où il provenait\n], elle pouvait prendre pour hypothèse (sans se prononcer définitivement sur cette question) qu'il était exposé à un risque de persécution ou\nelle pouvait faire abstraction de l'ensemble de la question\n. Dans la mesure où:\n(a) la Commission a appliqué le bon critère dans son analyse de la question de la PRI;\n(b) sa conclusion sur l'existence d'une PRI n'était pas manifestement déraisonnable, dans le sens où elle n'était étayée par aucun élément de preuve;\nSa décision doit être confirmée. [Je souligne; citations omises.]\n[37]\nEn l'espèce, la SPR a énoncé et appliqué le bon critère en examinant la PRI.\n[38]\nSes conclusions étaient étayées par la preuve, et elles font partie des issues raisonnables possibles au regard des faits et du droit. Il importe peu qu'elle n'ait pas conclu ou présumé que le demandeur craignait avec raison d'être persécuté dans la région d'où il provenait.\n[39]\nLa SPR a rendu une décision raisonnable en matière de PRI. Le demandeur n'a pas établi qu'elle avait commis une erreur susceptible de contrôle.\nConclusion\n[40]\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n[41]\nLe demandeur soumet pour certification des questions se rapportant aux points en litige. Comme ces points ont fait l'objet d'une ample jurisprudence, je n'accéderai pas à la demande de certification.\nJUGEMENT\n[42]\nLA COUR REND LE JUGEMENT SUIVANT\n:\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est rejetée.\n2. Aucune question de portée générale n'est certifiée.\n[End of document]",

Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nMandamin, J.\n: The Applicant, Mr. Jean Claude Nzayisenga, applies for judicial review of the June 24, 201l decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD).\n\n[2]\nThe RPD refused the Applicant's claim for refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the\nAct\n. The RPD determined that the Applicant is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\n\n[3]\nI conclude for reasons that follow that the application should be dismissed.\nBackground\n\n[4]\nThe Applicant, Jean Claude Nzayisenga, was born in Rwanda to a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother. He lived with his grandparents while he attended primary school. When the genocide in Rwanda started in 1994, a neighbour of his grandparents, Alphonse Buregeya, came and took the Applicant's grandparents away. The Applicant's grandparents were Tutsis and Seventh Day Adventists and were killed by the men who took them away.\n\n[5]\nThe Applicant rejoined his parents in Karambi, about five kilometres away. Later in 1994, Hutu neighbours came to the home and beat him and his mother.\n\n[6]\nAfter the genocide, the Applicant's parents denounced Mr. Buregeya who was imprisoned awaiting trial. In April, 2008, Mr. Buregeya appeared in the Gacaca court of Rwanda. The Applicant was summoned to testify which he did on May 12 and May 19, 2008. Mr. Buregeya was sentenced to 15 years in jail for his part in the genocide.\n\n[7]\nOn May 20, 2008, the Applicant was attacked by three men wearing masks. The Applicant was left unconscious on the side of the road. He was in hospital for about four days.\n\n[8]\nThe Applicant returned to the university he had been attending where he began receiving threatening calls on his cell phone. His parents also received calls on their home phone from unidentified men looking for the Applicant.\n\n[9]\nLater that year the Applicant received an internship to work with RiskMetric Group in the United States; the Applicant left Rwanda on October 8, 2008 for the United States.\n\n[10]\nOn December 27, 2008, the Applicant came to Quebec and made a refugee claim. The Applicant claims to fear Mr. Buregeya and his family.\nDecision Under Review\n\n[11]\nThe RPD found the Applicant was not a Convention refugee because he did not have a well founded fear of persecution in Rwanda and was not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Rwanda would not subject him personally to risk of harm. The RPD determinative issues were the nature of the harm the Applicant feared and the existence of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA).\n\n[12]\nThe RPD accepted the Applicant testified against Mr. Buregeya in the Gacaca Court and was beaten by unknown men following the trial. The RPD also accepted that the Applicant received threatening phone calls on his cell number from unidentified persons. The RPD also found that the last time his parents heard from anyone looking for the Applicant was approximately eight months before the RPD hearing.\n\n[13]\nThe RPD considered the current country conditions in Rwanda. The RPD noted the Rwandan government follow-up to the Gacaca Courts took measures to protect and improve the situation of the genocide survivors and witnesses.\n\n[14]\nThe RPD also found the documentary evidence did not corroborate the subjective fear the Applicant claimed. There were no reports of organized groups targeting genocide witnesses. The RPD found that 156 genocide survivors and witnesses were killed between 1995 and 2008 but this percentage was very low considering more than 1.2 million cases were heard in the Gacaca Courts. The RPD also noted that the documentary evidence showed that there had been major improvements in the previous year alone and that the fact that some people had been killed does not show an absence of state protection.\n\n[15]\nThe RPD found that that the Applicant's fear of persecution under s. 96 was not objectively well-founded on a forward-looking assessment.\n\n[16]\nIn regards to the s. 97 claim the RPD noted that the Applicant's parents still lived in the same place and that, although they were initially told that they would be harmed if they did not tell the caller about their son, this had not occurred. The RPD found the Rwandan government had taken significant steps to assist citizens of Rwanda after the genocide, and the Claimant's family had not been further contacted.\n\n[17]\nIn the alternative, the RPD also considered an internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Applicant. It set out the test for determining the existence of an IFA set out in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (FCA) [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] and then considered Kigali as a viable IFA.\n\n[18]\nThe RPD accepted that Rwanda is a small country, but stated that Kigali has a population of approximately one million people. The RPD decided there would be work opportunities for the Applicant in Kigali. The RPD also noted the Applicant is independent, well educated and does not require the assistance of his parents or family at this point in his life.\n\n[19]\nThe RPD found that the IFA of Kigali is objectively reasonable in all the circumstances.\nRelevant Legislation\n\n[20]\nThe\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 provides:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n...\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them Personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n...\n108. (1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Refugee Convention or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n...\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\n96. A refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\na) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\n...\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n...\n108. (1) The application for asylum is rejected and the applicant does not have the status of refugee or person in need of protection in any of the following cases:\n...\ne) the reasons which made him request asylum no longer exist.\n...\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply if the applicant proves that there are compelling reasons, relating to persecution, torture or previous treatment or punishment, for refusing to claim the protection of the country he left or outside which he remained.\nIssues\n\n[21]\nThe Applicant raised the following issues:\n1. Did the RPD fail to consider whether the Applicant suffered from cumulative harassment amounting to persecution?\n2. Did the RPD err by not conducting a \"compelling reasons\" analysis under paragraphs 108(1)(e) and 108(4) of\nIRPA\n?\n3. Does consideration of an IFA require a prior finding of a well-founded localized fear of persecution?\nStandard of Review\n\n[22]\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has held in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] that there are only two standards of review: correctness for questions of law and reasonableness involving questions of mixed fact and law and fact. The Supreme Court has also held that where the standard of review has been previously determined, a standard of review analysis need not be repeated.\n\n[23]\nThe RPD's determination of whether incidents of discrimination or harassment amount to persecution is a question of mixed fact and law to be determined on a standard of reasonableness.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLiang\n]\n\n[24]\nQuestions related to the application of section 108(1)(e) and 108(4) are determinations of mixed fact and law and are to be determined on a reasonableness standard.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . [\nLewis\n]\n\n[25]\nAn examination of the RPD's determination regarding the viability of an IFA is also a question of mixed law and fact to be determined on a standard of reasonableness.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]\nAnalysis\n\n[26]\nThe Applicant submits he had been persecuted since his grandparents had been murdered, he and his mother beaten, and he was beaten and hospitalized after he testified in the Gacaca court. The Applicant submits the RPD accepted this testimony but did not specifically address whether the various incidents of mistreatment cumulatively created a well-founded fear of persecution. The Applicant also submits the RPD was required to consider section 108 of\nIRPA\nbecause the preconditions for consideration of compelling reasons were present. Finally, the Applicant submits an IFA analysis requires the RPD to find or assume the existence of a localized well-founded fear of persecution before conducting a proper IFA analysis.\nCumulative Mistreatment\n\n[27]\nThe question of whether the cumulative incidents of mistreatment create a well founded fear of persecution has been addressed by this Court in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n... The doctrine of cumulative grounds of persecution was summarized by Mr. Justice Nadon, speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal, in\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 259. Where evidence establishes a series of actions characterized to be discriminatory, and not persecutory, the cumulative effect of that conduct must be considered. It would be an error of law for the RPD not to consider the cumulative nature of that conduct, as directed against the claimant. The RPD is duty bound to consider all the events which may have an impact on a claimant's submission that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution. <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 30\n\n[28]\nIn the case at hand, the RPD considered all of the incidents of mistreatment alleged by the Applicant. While the RPD did not specifically say it had considered the cumulative effect of those incidents, it is clear that the RPD was aware of the totality of the Applicant's allegations.\n\n[29]\nMoreover, the RPD was mindful of the change in circumstances in Rwanda. In my view, the RPD could proceed as it did since the Applicant's claim of fear rests, not on the totality of his experiences, but on the beating and threatening phone calls following his testimony in the Gracaca Court. The RPD decided the Applicant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the event of his return to Rwanda today given government measures to safeguard genocide victims and witnesses.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n\n[30]\nThe RPD made no error in its review of these incidents and consideration of the Rwanda government measures to support victims and witnesses. It cannot be said to have failed to consider all the events cumulatively as reviewed all incidents and reasonably assessed the objective basis for the Applicant's fear in light of the relevant circumstances.\nCompelling Reasons\n\n[31]\nGiven the RPD reasonably decided that the Applicant did not have a well founded fear of persecution, the precursors for a compelling reasons analysis under s. 108(4) were not present. Section 108(1) will only apply when the decision maker finds a claimant has a valid claim for refugee protection and then must find the cause of the persecution no longer exists. Only then does the decision maker consider s. 108(4).\n\n[32]\nThis Court has recently had the opportunity to address the application of subsection 108(4). In\nLewis\nat para 43, Justice Scott stated:\n43\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is the leading case. It states that section 108(1)(e) will only apply when the decision maker has made a determination that the person has had a valid claim for refugee protection due to persecution. The decision maker must then find that the cause of that persecution no longer exists. At this point, the decision maker can consider 108(4) and \"...whether the nature of the claimant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he or she should not be expected to return and put himself or herself under the protection of that state\".\n\n[33]\nThis was not a case where the Applicant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he should not be expected to return and put himself under the protection of the state. The RPD did not err for not conducting such an analysis.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n\n[34]\nIn order to qualify for protection under either section 96 or 97, a claimant must face risk in all parts of the country he is fleeing. If there is a part of the country, an IFA, in which the claimant does not face risk, then that claimant does not meet the requirements for protection, irrespective of whether the claimant faces risk in the area that he fled.\n\n[35]\nThis Court has stated that the RPD need not proceed in the manner urged by the Applicant that the RPD must first find or assume the existence of a well-founded fear before conducting an IFA analysis.\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  ACWS (3d) 1196 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ].\n\n[36]\nIn <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 7, Justice Snider stated that the RPD, in performing an IFA analysis, is not required to first make a finding that the Applicant faced a localized risk as argued by the Applicant:\nWhen looking at the existence of an IFA,\nthe Board could find that the Applicant faced a risk of persecution in [the area from which he originates\n], the Board could assume (without finally determining the question) that he faced persecution\nor it could ignore the whole question\n. As long as:\n(a) The Board applied the correct test to its IFA analysis; and\n(b) Its conclusions on the existence of an IFA was not patently unreasonable, in the sense that it is unsupported by the evidence;\nIts decision should stand. [Emphasis added, citations omitted]\n\n[37]\nHere, the RPD stated and applied the correct test to its IFA analysis.\n\n[38]\nThe RPD's conclusions were supported by the evidence and fall within the range of reasonable outcomes based on the applicable law and facts. It does not matter that the RPD did not find or assume the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution in the area from which the Applicant originates.\n\n[39]\nThe RPD's IFA determination is reasonable. The Applicant has failed to establish that the RPD has made a reviewable error.\nConclusion\n\n[40]\nThe application for judicial review does not succeed.\n\n[41]\nThe Applicant proposes questions for certification which reflect the issues identified. These questions have already been addressed by ample jurisprudence and I decline to certify the questions.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[42]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question of general importance is certified.\n.........................\nJean Claude Nzayisenga (plaintiff) and The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (respondent)",
