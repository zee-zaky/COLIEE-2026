    "[1]\nSnider, J.\n: Mr. Stachowski, a resident of Canada since July, 1991, applied for an Old Age Security (\"OAS\") pension under the\nOld Age Security Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-8 (the \"\nOAS Act\n\"). The Minister of Human Resources Development Canada (now the Minister of Social Development) determined that Mr. Stachowski was entitled to an OAS pension of 5/40ths of a full OAS pension, limiting his entitlement to his residency in Canada between 1991 and 1996. Believing that he is entitled to a full OAS pension, based on \"deemed residency\" for the period between 1968 and 1991, Mr. Stachowski appealed that decision to the Canada Pension Plan - Old Age Security Review Tribunal (the \"Review Tribunal\"). The Review Tribunal, in a decision dated October 4, 2004, dismissed his appeal. Mr. Stachowski seeks judicial review of the decision of the Review Tribunal.\nIssues",
    "[2]\nThe overarching issue in this application is whether the Review Tribunal erred in concluding that the period between 1968 and 1991 did not count towards the calculation of Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension. The response to this question requires that I address the following:\n1. In order to obtain qualifying deemed residence for purposes of calculating OAS pension benefits, do the\nOAS Act\nand the\nOld Age Security Regulations\n, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1246, as amended (the \"\nRegulations\n\") require that the spouse of a person abroad on missionary service have an initial period of actual residence in Canada? Stated in other words directly applicable to Mr. Stachowski, is the period of time from 1968, when Mr. Stachowski married a person deemed to be resident in Canada, to 1991, when he became a landed immigrant in Canada, \"residence\" for purposes of calculating Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension, notwithstanding that he had no period of initial residence in Canada before 1968?\n2. Is Mr. Stachowski deemed not to be resident in Canada for the period from 1968 to 1988 because of his contributions to the German mandatory pension scheme?\nFacts",
    "[3]\nThe material facts are not disputed. In summary form, they are as follows:\n- Mr. Stachowski is a German citizen who was born in Poland on October 6, 1931.\n- On July 25, 1968, he was married, in Germany, to Erika Martha Sommerfeld.\n- Ms. Stachowski lived in Canada, as a legal resident, from January, 1953 to 1961. The Review Tribunal accepted (and this was not disputed by the Respondent in this application) that Ms. Stachowski's period of interruption in residence from 1961 until 1989, during which time she was engaged in studies followed by missionary work, is deemed as residency for OAS calculation purposes, pursuant to s. 21(5)(b)(vi) of the\nOAS Regulations\n. (Because of her long absence from Canada, however, Ms. Stachowski was required to reapply for residence in Canada; this issue is not material to this application.)\n- Mr. Stachowski and his wife worked in missionary service, in a number of countries, until 1988 (Mr. Stachowski) and 1989 (Ms. Stachowksi).\n- Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German Social Security System from 1948 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1988 and began receiving a German Pension on June 23, 1995.\n- Mr. Stachowski was admitted to Canada as a landed immigrant in July, 1991.\n- Mr. Stachowski applied for OAS pension on June 21, 2001.\nMr. Stachowski's Calculation",
    "[4]\nMr. Stachowski has argued to the Minister, the Review Tribunal and this Court that he is entitled to a full monthly OAS pension commencing November, 1996. In his revised Notice of Appeal to the Review Tribunal, he described his entitlement as follows:\n(a) attained sixty-five years of age prior to that date,\n(b) submitted my application for German benefits on June 23, 1995,\n(c) On the 1st day of January, 1977, I was considered to be resident and present in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n,\n(d) I resided in Canada for 8 years, 11 months and 9 days prior to the day my application for a pension was approved and I was considered to be present in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nfor more that three years and sixty-six days prior to yen years immediately preceding the day on which my application was approved, and\n(e) I resided in Canada for more than one year immediately preceding the day on which my application for a pension was approved.",
    "[5]\nBut for two questions, Mr. Stachowski's interpretation of his entitlement would be correct. First, under (c), was he \"considered to be a resident in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n\"? Secondly, does his payment into the German Social Security System between 1948 and 1988 impact on the calculation? These, of course, are the issues that were before the Review Tribunal and which are before me in this application.\nAnalysis\nStandard of Review",
    "[6]\nThe questions raised by this application require the interpretation of relevant provisions of the\nOAS Act\nand\nRegulations\n. To the extent that these are questions of pure law and do not require an application of the facts to that law, the parties agree that the applicable standard of review is correctness.\nPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation",
    "[7]\nSince issues of statutory interpretation are at the heart of this dispute, it is useful to begin with an overview of the principles related to such matters. On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court of Canada has given guidance on how to approach a problem of statutory interpretation. In\nRizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re\n, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1, at paragraph 21, Mr. Justice Iacobucci, speaking for the unanimous Court, endorsed the statement of Elmer Driedger in\nDriedger on the Construction of Statutes\n, 2nd Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1983), that:\nToday there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.",
    "[8]\nAccordingly, the task of the Court in interpreting legislation cannot be restricted to analysing the plain meaning of the provision in question. Further, while the statutory words must be given a \"fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objectives\" (\nInterpretation Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 12), attention must be directed to the scheme and objective of the\nAct\n, the intention of the legislature, and the context of the words in issue (\nRizzo\n, supra, at para. 23). The Court in\nRizzo\n, supra, at para. 31, approved of the use of legislative history as a tool for determining the intention of the legislature. And, regardless of how clear and unambiguous the words of a provision may be, the further analysis must be carried out. Indeed, a failure to determine the intention of the legislature in enacting a particular provision has been found to be an error (\nRizzo\n, supra, at paras. 23, 31). It follows that, where there are conflicting but not unreasonable interpretations available, the contextual framework of the legislation becomes even more important.\nIssue #1: Was Mr. Stachowski deemed resident of Canada from the date of his marriage in 1968?\nReview Tribunal Decision",
    "[9]\nMr. Stachowski's submissions to the Review Tribunal were, as before me, based on two arguments. The first of these is that s. 21(3) of the\nOAS Regulations\napplies to his situation on the basis that he returned to Canada with his wife within six months of terminating his missionary service abroad. In Mr. Stachowski's submission, he became deemed to be resident in Canada for OAS purposes upon his marriage. He argues that, if s. 21(3) requires a non-resident to have been resident in Canada prior to completing missionary service, the provision would be \"virtually inoperative\".",
    "[10]\nThe Review Tribunal did not accept Mr. Stachowski's submissions. Its reasons were as follows:\nThe overriding entitlement of the Old Age Security regime is residence in Canada. The provisions of s. 21(4) of the\nRegulations\ndeems certain intervals or absence from Canada to be continued residence even though the person is not actually physically in Canada. Accordingly s. 21(4) of the\nRegulations\ncontinues to import a requirement that the person initially be in Canada and then excludes any interval of absence from Canada, not to have interrupted that person's residence or presence in Canada. Accordingly the Appellant's submission that the provision would be rendered nugatory, is not accepted by the panel, as there would clearly be situations where a couple leaves Canada to serve outside Canada but only one acts as a missionary. The non-missionary spouse would but for the provision of s. 21(5)(c) of the\nRegulations\nlose qualifying residency for the purposes of entitlement to benefits under the\nAct\n. A spouse of the missionary would continue to earn eligibility for Old Age Security by virtue of the deemed residence provided in s. 21(5)(c) of the\nRegulations\n.\nIn order to obtain qualifying deemed residence the spouse of the missionary must have an initial period of actual residence in Canada as required by the\nAct\nand\nRegulations\nin order to trigger the benefit of s. 21(5)(c).\n (Emphasis added)\nStatutory Scheme",
    "[11]\nSection 3 of the\nOAS Act\nprovides for the payment of a full or partial monthly pension to persons 65 years or older. The full text of this and other statutory provisions relevant to this application are attached as Appendix A to these reasons.",
    "[12]\nResidency in Canada is the key to the OAS pension. Entitlement to and the amount of the pension depends on the number of years a claimant has resided in Canada after reaching the age of 18. Normally, a full pension is paid after 40 years of residence in Canada (or deemed residence, as discussed later in these reasons). However, under the special circumstances described in s. 3(1)(b) of the\nOAS Act\n, a claimant may still be eligible for a full pension with fewer than 40 years of residence. This provision is referred to as the \"3-for-1 Rule\".",
    "[13]\nThe\nOAS Act\nalso authorizes the payment of a partial monthly pension for certain persons who do not qualify for a full monthly pension. Such partial payments are set out in s. 3(2) and (3) of the\nOAS Act\n. The amount of a partial pension is determined by dividing the number of years of Canadian residence by 40, with the aggregate number of years rounded down to a whole number of years.",
    "[14]\nThe terms \"resided\" and \"residence in Canada\" are not defined in the\nAct\nbut are described in s. 21 of the\nOAS Regulations\n. Certain time abroad may be deemed to be residence in Canada for purposes of the calculation of eligibility for OAS pension. Of particular relevance to this application, a person whose presence in Canada is interrupted to serve as a missionary is deemed resident in Canada during the period of the interruption (s. 21(5)(b)(vi)).",
    "[15]\nThe\nOAS Regulations\nalso address the situation of spouses or partners of persons whose interruptions satisfy the deeming provisions. Section 21(3) of\nOAS Regulation\nappears to apply in situations where the marriage takes place after the person in missionary service is already abroad and operates to deem the spouse or partner resident from the date of the marriage. Section 21(5) appears to apply when the partner accompanies the person in missionary service throughout his or her service and operates to deem residence for the partner from the date of departure from Canada.\nReview Tribunal's reference to s. 21(5) of the OAS Regulations",
    "[16]\nVarious provisions of the\nOAS Regulations\napply to permit persons outside of Canada to be deemed resident for purposes of OAS pension calculations. It was not disputed that s. 21(4) and 21(5)(b)(vi) apply to Ms. Stachowski to deem her time served abroad in missionary service as residence for OAS calculation purposes.",
    "[17]\nBoth s. 21(3) and s. 21(5) of the\nOAS Regulations\napply to situations where a person is out of Canada with a partner who would be deemed resident by virtue of the\nOAS Regulations\n. The obvious intent of these provisions is to allow couples to live abroad together without negative impact on OAS eligibility for the partner who does not qualify under one of the interruption provisions in s. 21(4). The difference between s. 21(3) and (5) appears to be one of timing. If the persons were partners who left Canada together, s. 21(5)(c) applies to deem the time abroad for the accompanying partner as residence. However, if the two persons became partners while the missionary or soldier, for example, was already abroad, s. 21(3) applies.",
    "[18]\nThe Review Tribunal decision refers only to s. 21(5), a provision that may not be applicable since Mr. Stachowski did not accompany his wife when she left Canada. No reference whatsoever was made to s. 21(3) in the decision, in spite of the fact that Mr. Stachowski's appeal to the tribunal was very clear that he was relying on s. 21(3). Even the submissions of the Minister to the Review Tribunal referred only to s. 21(3).",
    "[19]\nIt appears that only s. 21(3) could possibly be applicable to Mr. Stachowski. This is because, at the time of his marriage, Mr. Stachowski was not a Canadian resident and was outside Canada. The Respondent acknowledges that the Review Tribunal referred to the wrong provision in its decision but submits that the error is immaterial given that the Review Tribunal clearly put its mind to the correct test for deemed residency. Specifically, the Review Tribunal asked itself whether the\nOAS Regulations\nrequired Mr. Stachowski to have a prior attachment to Canada before the deeming provisions of the\nRegulations\napplied to him.",
    "[20]\nIs it possible that the Review Tribunal's error in identifying s. 21(5) rather than 21(3) was merely an administrative oversight? As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 81; 100 W.A.C. 81, at paragraph 20, \"Courts are primarily concerned with whether a statutory power exists, not with whether the delegate knew how to locate it\". However, this is not simply a case where the tribunal's analysis could apply if one were to replace s. 21(5) with s. 21(3) where it appears in the decision. The decision of the Review Tribunal turns on the interpretation of the words of the relevant provisions of the Regulations. In its reasons, the Review Tribunal finds support for its decision in the language of s. 21(4) which includes the words \"any interval of absence\" and that of s. 21(5) which refers to \"The absences from Canada referred to in paragraph (4)(c) of a person residing in Canada\". In contrast, s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nsits outside the framework of s. 21(4) and (5). This provision does not refer to any \"interval of absence\"; it is fundamentally different from s. 21(5). The conclusion that I must draw is that the Review Tribunal misapprehended the evidence and directed its mind to the wrong question. Thus, I do not agree with the Respondent's submission that the Review Tribunal put its mind to the correct test. This is not a case contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .",
    "[21]\nThe Review Tribunal was obliged to consider and interpret the correct provision of its home legislation. It failed to do so. On this basis and regardless of the applicable standard of review, the application should succeed and the matter be referred back to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration of this question. This is not to say that the Review Tribunal could not conclude that s. 21(3) requires an initial period of actual residence in Canada. It may be open to the Review Tribunal, after considering the proper interpretation of s. 21(3) on sound principles of statutory interpretation, to reach the same conclusion.\nIssue #2: Was Mr. Stachowski precluded from being deemed resident in Canada because of his participation in the German mandatory pension scheme?",
    "[22]\nMr. Stachoski's second ground of appeal to the Review Tribunal was his position that s. 21(5.3) of the Regulations was not applicable to him. That is, Mr. Stachowski does not agree that the periods of time that he participated in the German Social Benefit Plan should be excluded from the operation of s. 21(5).\nReview Tribunal Decision",
    "[23]\nOn this issue, the Review concluded that the Minister \"correctly applied the provisions of s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nin that the periods of time the Appellant participated in the German Social Benefit Plan are excluded from the operation of s. 21(5).\" The reasons for this result are as follows:\nAgain, the overall concept of the legislation requires residency and s. 21(4) exempts certain periods of absence to continue the person's qualifying residency. The Appellant submitted that s. 21(5.3) is ambiguous and that it does not clearly override or set a priority with respect to the applications of s. 21(4) and (5). We disagree in that the Sections have to be read in their entirety and notice taken of the curative aspects of s. 21(5.3) following the decision in\nBarnes\n. Accordingly s. 21(5.3) which is specific is to be read as overriding the general provisions which come before it, in that it specifically excludes a certain class of persons from the operations of ss. 21(4) and (5). Any other reading would render the operation of the Section nugatory and this is not in keeping with the purpose of the legislation. It is clear that the purpose of the legislation is to ensure that persons are not disadvantaged by the fact that they have only partial periods of residence in two countries and conversely to ensure that persons are not entitled to double benefits as a result of having residences in two countries. The Appellant stated that the German plan is a contributory plan and therefore only akin to the Canada Pension Plan legislation and should not be considered in conjunction with the Old Age Security legislation. With the greatest of respect, we disagree that it clearly is the policy of both Canada Pension Plan and\nOld Age Security Act\nto integrate the plans under both pieces of Canadian legislation with the single regimes of contributory legislation and other jurisdictions including particularly Germany in this case.",
    "[24]\nUnlike the situation with the first issue in this application, the Review Tribunal appears to have understood and addressed the correct questions. I must determine whether the tribunal erred in concluding that the periods of time Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German pension plan are excluded from the calculation of eligibility for OAS benefits.\nStatutory Scheme",
    "[25]\nFor purposes of this issue, there are four directly relevant legislative provisions. The full text of the relevant legislation is set out in Appendix A.\n1. The starting point is s. 40 of the\nOAS Act\n. This provision applies where, under the law of a country other than Canada, provision is made for the payment of old age, or other benefits. In these circumstances, the Minister may enter into an agreement with the another country for the making of reciprocal arrangements relating to the administration or operation of the foreign law and the\nOAS Act\n. Section 40 also specifically sets out that any such agreement may provide for the increase or decrease in the amount of benefits payable under the foreign law or the\nOAS Act\n.\n2. Section 41 provides that, from the day it comes into force, any such agreement \"has the force of law in Canada\" so long as the agreement remains in force.\n3. By Agreement dated November 14, 1985 (in force April 1, 1988), Canada entered into an agreement entitled \"SOCIAL SECURITY, Agreement between CANADA and the FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY\" (the \"Canada/Germany Agreement\"). Of particular relevance to the question in this application, Article 11(b) provides that, for the purposes of the\nOAS Act\n, if a person is subject to the German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage during any period of residence in Canada, that period shall not be considered as a period of residence in Canada.\n4. The\nOAS Regulations\nalso address this issue providing in s. 21(5.3) that, where, \"by virtue of an agreement entered into under subsection 40(1)\", a person is subject to the legislation of a foreign country, the person will \"be deemed not to be resident in Canada\".",
    "[26]\nThe full text of the relevant provisions is set out in Appendix A.\nMr. Stachowski's Situation",
    "[27]\nIn spite of able representations by counsel for Mr. Stachowski, I can see no other possible interpretation of these provisions than that adopted by the Review Tribunal.",
    "[28]\nFor purposes of this question, I have assumed, without deciding, that the first issue is resolved in favour of Mr. Stachowski. That is, the period of time he was abroad, from 1968, when he married, to 1991, when he was landed in Canada, was \"residence and presence in Canada\" as contemplated by the\nOAS Act\nand the\nOAS Regulations\n.",
    "[29]\nBetween 1968 and 1988, Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German Social Benefit Plan. I accept (and there is no evidence to the contrary) that this plan is mandatory.",
    "[30]\nMr. Stachowski argues that he was subject to the German legislation\nby virtue\nof his German citizenship and residence in Germany, and not\nby virtue\nof the Canada/Germany Agreement and that s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nonly applies where a person qualifies for benefits in a country which they would not otherwise have qualified for but for the Canada/Germany Agreement. Mr. Stachowski submits that the provision cannot operate where a person is entitled to benefits independent of the Canada/Germany Agreement. In this case, he argues that he is eligible for benefits pursuant to s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n.",
    "[31]\nIn essence, Mr. Stachowski argues that, since he has been deemed resident pursuant to s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n, he cannot be \"undeemed\" by another provision of the\nRegulations\n. I do not agree with this interpretation.",
    "[32]\nThe principal difficulty with the interpretation urged on me by Mr. Stachowski is that it ignores all other legislative provisions where this issue is addressed. As noted above, the words of a statute are to be read in their entire context. Here, that context involves not only the words of s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, but the words of the enabling statute and, in this case, the Canada/Germany Agreement.",
    "[33]\nGuidance on how to undertake this task was provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In that case, the Court was considering the interpretation of certain provisions of the\nNational Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations\n, SOR/91-7. As noted by Justice Décary, at paragraph 11:\nNormally, in cases such as this one, the Court will examine the provisions of the enabling statute first in order to ascertain precisely what it is that Parliament has allowed to be regulated. It will then turn to the regulation.\nThere being a presumption that the regulation has been passed in accordance with the provisions of the enabling statute and that there is coherence between the terms used in the statute and those used in the regulation, the Court will endeavour to interpret the regulation in such a way as to keep it within the confines permitted by the enabling statute.\nShould that prove impossible, the regulation or part of it will be declared ultra vires. Reconciliation is therefore the rule, and it will be achieved in most cases. (Emphasis added)",
    "[34]\nIn the situation before me, I begin with the provisions of the\nOAS Act\n. The authority of the Minister to enter into the Canada/Germany Agreement arises from the operation of s. 40. Section 41 gives the Governor in Council the ability, by order, to declare the Agreement in force. This was done (\nProclamation Declaring the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany in Force April 1, 1988\n, SI/88-127, C. Gaz. 1988.II). With the Proclamation, the Canada/Germany Agreement, including Article 11(b), has the force of law in Canada (\nOAS Act\n, s. 41(1)). The power of the Governor in Council to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the Agreement is set out in s. 40(2). This was done as evidenced by s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. As taught by\nOntario Hydro\n, s. 21(5.3) must be interpreted such that there is \"coherence\" between this provision and Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement.",
    "[35]\nArticle 11(b) is, in my view, plainly applicable to Mr. Stachowski. Until 1988, Mr. Stachowski was subject to German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage, as contemplated by Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement. Accordingly, the period from 1968 to 1988 \"shall not be considered as a period of residence in Canada\".",
    "[36]\nThe interpretation promoted by Mr. Stachowski causes an incongruous collision between Article 11(b) of the Agreement and s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. If I apply the logic of Mr. Stachowski's submissions, I am obliged to \"read down\" Article 11(b) such that it does not apply if the person's residency is \"deemed residency\" and not actual residency. Those words are not in Article 11(b); they should not be read into s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. It does not matter whether Mr. Stachowski's residence is established by physical presence (s. 21(1)) or by the operation of other provisions in s. 21 of the\nOAS Regulations\n. In either case, Article 11(b) applies such that the period from 1968 to 1988 cannot be considered to be residence.",
    "[37]\nSection 21 of the\nRegulations\ncontains a number of different deeming provisions. To the extent there appears to be a conflict between any two of them, the principles of statutory interpretation teach us that we should look to the whole legislative scheme for help. In this case, assuming that s. 21(3) deems Mr. Stachowki to be resident, s. 21(5.3), in the submission of Mr. Stachowski, appears to say the opposite. If so, the result would be a conflict between two provisions of the\nRegulations\n. However, I am of the opinion that these provisions can be read harmoniously, in a way that achieves the objectives of the\nAct\nand the Agreement, which as I discuss below is partly to avoid the conferment of double benefits.",
    "[38]\nAs noted by Mr. Stachowski, he was subject to the German legislation\nby virtue\nof his German citizenship and residence in Germany, and not\nby virtue\nof the Canada/Germany Agreement. The words \"by virtue of an agreement\" in s. 21(5.3) appear to be misplaced. It is nonsensical to describe a person as being subject to the legislation of a country by virtue of a bi-lateral agreement. Obviously, Mr. Stachowski is subject to the German legislation by virtue of his citizenship and residency over the years pursuant to the applicable legislation of that country. But this odd drafting of the\nRegulation\ndoes not, in my view, mean that Mr. Stachowski's interpretation should be adopted; rather, it makes it even more important that the context of the entire legislative scheme be examined.",
    "[39]\nI turn to the purpose of these statutory provisions. The arrangements made by Canada and Germany are, in part, designed to avoid the situation where a senior citizen claims benefits under both Canadian and German laws. If I interpret the\nRegulations\nin the manner suggested by Mr. Stachowski, he will receive pension benefits from both countries related to the period of 1968 to 1988. This cannot be the intended result of the legislative scheme. I have reviewed the House of Commons debates concerning amendments to the\nAct\nwhich brought in s. 40 and the reciprocal OAS agreement scheme. During one such debate, it was expressed by the Hon. Marc Lalonde that:\n[t]he central purpose of reciprocal international agreements is to protect migrants who spend portions of their working lives in more than one country. Such people cannot always meet the minimum eligibility requirements of the mandatory social security programs to which they have contributed.\n. . . . .\nInternational agreement also provide for the removal of duplicate coverage [House of Commons Debates, (February 9, 1977) at 2835 (Hon. Marc Lalonde)].\nThe Hon. Mr. Lincoln Alexander also stated that\nAnother point is that by simple agreement we will remove duplicate social security coverage.\n. . . . .\nLet me emphasize that in the absence of reciprocal agreement immigrants will continue to be deprived of benefits earned in their former countries of residence [Ibid. at 2842 (Hon. Lincoln M. Alexander)].\nUpon my reading of the debates, and particularly in light of the portions excerpted above, it is my understanding that the reciprocal OAS agreement scheme was implemented to ensure that foreign nationals who immigrate to Canada, often late in their lives, receive\nsome\nform of adequate old age security, rather than be deprived of security related to a period of time during which they may have paid into a foreign OAS system. I also comprehend that this system was intended to prevent \"duplicate social security coverage.\"",
    "[40]\nSections 21(3) and 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, in conjunction with Article (11)(b) of the Agreement, work together to achieve both purposes outlined in the House of Commons debates. If Article 11(b) and s. 21(5.3) are read to apply to all residents, including \"deemed residents\" such as Mr. Stachowski, then duplicate coverage is avoided. On the other hand, in the absence of an OAS agreement between Canada and the former country of residence of the claimant, s. 21(5.3) would not activate and that claimant would be entitled to Canadian OAS benefits calculated from over a longer period. In both situations, a senior citizen receives benefits, relating to a given period of residence, from at least one country\nand only\none country.",
    "[41]\nIt could be said that s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nand Article 11(b) of the Agreement appear redundant, and in light of the maxim of statutory interpretation that Parliament is presumed not to be redundant, the interpretation proffered above runs afoul of that rule. To that argument, I say that s. 21(5.3) is only redundant in the specific context of the Canada/Germany Agreement. There may very well be OAS agreements which do not include a provision like Article 11(b), which would then be \"caught\" by s. 21(5.3) to block duplicate benefits. The drafter of s. 21(5.3) could not have anticipated the content of every international agreement that Canada would later enter into with foreign countries, and s. 21(5.3) acts as a safety net in that regard.",
    "[42]\nIn conclusion, the interpretation that best fits the context as a whole is that the period during which Mr. Stachowski paid into the mandatory German Social Benefit Plan cannot be considered residency for purposes of calculating his OAS benefits entitlement. This is so whether Mr. Stachowski is deemed resident pursuant to s. 21(3) or is physically present in Canada.",
    "[43]\nIn summary, Mr. Stachowski was subject to the German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage during the period of time between 1968 and 1988 when he alleges that he was resident in Canada pursuant to the provisions of the\nRegulations\n. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 11 of the Canada/Germany Agreement and s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, this period of time cannot be considered to be a period of residency for OAS purposes. The Review Tribunal was correct in its interpretation of the legislative scheme and its conclusion on this issue.\nConclusion",
    "[44]\nIn conclusion, the Review Tribunal erred due to its failure to consider the applicability of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nto Mr. Stachowski's situation. However, the Review Tribunal correctly determined that Mr. Stachowski is deemed not to be resident in Canada for the period from 1968 to 1988 because of his contributions to the German mandatory pension scheme.",
    "[45]\nAccordingly, the matter should be remitted to a differently constituted panel of the Review Tribunal. Because Mr. Stachowski was not successful on the second issue, the Review Tribunal need only address the question of the correct interpretation of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nand its applicability to the calculation of Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension benefits. In effect, the only period of time that needs to be considered by the Review Tribunal is the period from when Mr. Stachowski's contributions to the German pension scheme ceased in 1988 to the date when he landed in Canada in 1991.",
    "[46]\nAs Mr. Stachowski's success was only partial, in my discretion, there will be no award of costs.\nORDER",
    "[47]\nThis court orders that:\n1. The Decision of the Review Tribunal that \"in order to obtain qualifying deemed residence the spouse of the missionary must have an initial period of actual residence in Canada as required by the\nAct\nand\nRegulations\nin order to trigger the benefit of s. 21(5)(c)\" is quashed and this matter remitted to a different panel of the Review Tribunal for reconsideration.\n2. The application for judicial review is dismissed with respect to the others matters before the Review Tribunal.\n3. There is no order as to costs.\nApplication allowed in part.\nEditor: Jana A.

  "full_text": "[1]\nSnider, J.\n: Mr. Stachowski, a resident of Canada since July, 1991, applied for an Old Age Security (\"OAS\") pension under the\nOld Age Security Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-8 (the \"\nOAS Act\n\"). The Minister of Human Resources Development Canada (now the Minister of Social Development) determined that Mr. Stachowski was entitled to an OAS pension of 5/40ths of a full OAS pension, limiting his entitlement to his residency in Canada between 1991 and 1996. Believing that he is entitled to a full OAS pension, based on \"deemed residency\" for the period between 1968 and 1991, Mr. Stachowski appealed that decision to the Canada Pension Plan - Old Age Security Review Tribunal (the \"Review Tribunal\"). The Review Tribunal, in a decision dated October 4, 2004, dismissed his appeal. Mr. Stachowski seeks judicial review of the decision of the Review Tribunal.\nIssues\n[2]\nThe overarching issue in this application is whether the Review Tribunal erred in concluding that the period between 1968 and 1991 did not count towards the calculation of Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension. The response to this question requires that I address the following:\n1. In order to obtain qualifying deemed residence for purposes of calculating OAS pension benefits, do the\nOAS Act\nand the\nOld Age Security Regulations\n, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1246, as amended (the \"\nRegulations\n\") require that the spouse of a person abroad on missionary service have an initial period of actual residence in Canada? Stated in other words directly applicable to Mr. Stachowski, is the period of time from 1968, when Mr. Stachowski married a person deemed to be resident in Canada, to 1991, when he became a landed immigrant in Canada, \"residence\" for purposes of calculating Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension, notwithstanding that he had no period of initial residence in Canada before 1968?\n2. Is Mr. Stachowski deemed not to be resident in Canada for the period from 1968 to 1988 because of his contributions to the German mandatory pension scheme?\nFacts\n[3]\nThe material facts are not disputed. In summary form, they are as follows:\n- Mr. Stachowski is a German citizen who was born in Poland on October 6, 1931.\n- On July 25, 1968, he was married, in Germany, to Erika Martha Sommerfeld.\n- Ms. Stachowski lived in Canada, as a legal resident, from January, 1953 to 1961. The Review Tribunal accepted (and this was not disputed by the Respondent in this application) that Ms. Stachowski's period of interruption in residence from 1961 until 1989, during which time she was engaged in studies followed by missionary work, is deemed as residency for OAS calculation purposes, pursuant to s. 21(5)(b)(vi) of the\nOAS Regulations\n. (Because of her long absence from Canada, however, Ms. Stachowski was required to reapply for residence in Canada; this issue is not material to this application.)\n- Mr. Stachowski and his wife worked in missionary service, in a number of countries, until 1988 (Mr. Stachowski) and 1989 (Ms. Stachowksi).\n- Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German Social Security System from 1948 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1988 and began receiving a German Pension on June 23, 1995.\n- Mr. Stachowski was admitted to Canada as a landed immigrant in July, 1991.\n- Mr. Stachowski applied for OAS pension on June 21, 2001.\nMr. Stachowski's Calculation\n[4]\nMr. Stachowski has argued to the Minister, the Review Tribunal and this Court that he is entitled to a full monthly OAS pension commencing November, 1996. In his revised Notice of Appeal to the Review Tribunal, he described his entitlement as follows:\n(a) attained sixty-five years of age prior to that date,\n(b) submitted my application for German benefits on June 23, 1995,\n(c) On the 1st day of January, 1977, I was considered to be resident and present in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n,\n(d) I resided in Canada for 8 years, 11 months and 9 days prior to the day my application for a pension was approved and I was considered to be present in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nfor more that three years and sixty-six days prior to yen years immediately preceding the day on which my application was approved, and\n(e) I resided in Canada for more than one year immediately preceding the day on which my application for a pension was approved.\n[5]\nBut for two questions, Mr. Stachowski's interpretation of his entitlement would be correct. First, under (c), was he \"considered to be a resident in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n\"? Secondly, does his payment into the German Social Security System between 1948 and 1988 impact on the calculation? These, of course, are the issues that were before the Review Tribunal and which are before me in this application.\nAnalysis\nStandard of Review\n[6]\nThe questions raised by this application require the interpretation of relevant provisions of the\nOAS Act\nand\nRegulations\n. To the extent that these are questions of pure law and do not require an application of the facts to that law, the parties agree that the applicable standard of review is correctness.\nPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation\n[7]\nSince issues of statutory interpretation are at the heart of this dispute, it is useful to begin with an overview of the principles related to such matters. On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court of Canada has given guidance on how to approach a problem of statutory interpretation. In\nRizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re\n, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1, at paragraph 21, Mr. Justice Iacobucci, speaking for the unanimous Court, endorsed the statement of Elmer Driedger in\nDriedger on the Construction of Statutes\n, 2nd Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1983), that:\nToday there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.\n[8]\nAccordingly, the task of the Court in interpreting legislation cannot be restricted to analysing the plain meaning of the provision in question. Further, while the statutory words must be given a \"fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objectives\" (\nInterpretation Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 12), attention must be directed to the scheme and objective of the\nAct\n, the intention of the legislature, and the context of the words in issue (\nRizzo\n, supra, at para. 23). The Court in\nRizzo\n, supra, at para. 31, approved of the use of legislative history as a tool for determining the intention of the legislature. And, regardless of how clear and unambiguous the words of a provision may be, the further analysis must be carried out. Indeed, a failure to determine the intention of the legislature in enacting a particular provision has been found to be an error (\nRizzo\n, supra, at paras. 23, 31). It follows that, where there are conflicting but not unreasonable interpretations available, the contextual framework of the legislation becomes even more important.\nIssue #1: Was Mr. Stachowski deemed resident of Canada from the date of his marriage in 1968?\nReview Tribunal Decision\n[9]\nMr. Stachowski's submissions to the Review Tribunal were, as before me, based on two arguments. The first of these is that s. 21(3) of the\nOAS Regulations\napplies to his situation on the basis that he returned to Canada with his wife within six months of terminating his missionary service abroad. In Mr. Stachowski's submission, he became deemed to be resident in Canada for OAS purposes upon his marriage. He argues that, if s. 21(3) requires a non-resident to have been resident in Canada prior to completing missionary service, the provision would be \"virtually inoperative\".\n[10]\nThe Review Tribunal did not accept Mr. Stachowski's submissions. Its reasons were as follows:\nThe overriding entitlement of the Old Age Security regime is residence in Canada. The provisions of s. 21(4) of the\nRegulations\ndeems certain intervals or absence from Canada to be continued residence even though the person is not actually physically in Canada. Accordingly s. 21(4) of the\nRegulations\ncontinues to import a requirement that the person initially be in Canada and then excludes any interval of absence from Canada, not to have interrupted that person's residence or presence in Canada. Accordingly the Appellant's submission that the provision would be rendered nugatory, is not accepted by the panel, as there would clearly be situations where a couple leaves Canada to serve outside Canada but only one acts as a missionary. The non-missionary spouse would but for the provision of s. 21(5)(c) of the\nRegulations\nlose qualifying residency for the purposes of entitlement to benefits under the\nAct\n. A spouse of the missionary would continue to earn eligibility for Old Age Security by virtue of the deemed residence provided in s. 21(5)(c) of the\nRegulations\n.\nIn order to obtain qualifying deemed residence the spouse of the missionary must have an initial period of actual residence in Canada as required by the\nAct\nand\nRegulations\nin order to trigger the benefit of s. 21(5)(c).\n (Emphasis added)\nStatutory Scheme\n[11]\nSection 3 of the\nOAS Act\nprovides for the payment of a full or partial monthly pension to persons 65 years or older. The full text of this and other statutory provisions relevant to this application are attached as Appendix A to these reasons.\n[12]\nResidency in Canada is the key to the OAS pension. Entitlement to and the amount of the pension depends on the number of years a claimant has resided in Canada after reaching the age of 18. Normally, a full pension is paid after 40 years of residence in Canada (or deemed residence, as discussed later in these reasons). However, under the special circumstances described in s. 3(1)(b) of the\nOAS Act\n, a claimant may still be eligible for a full pension with fewer than 40 years of residence. This provision is referred to as the \"3-for-1 Rule\".\n[13]\nThe\nOAS Act\nalso authorizes the payment of a partial monthly pension for certain persons who do not qualify for a full monthly pension. Such partial payments are set out in s. 3(2) and (3) of the\nOAS Act\n. The amount of a partial pension is determined by dividing the number of years of Canadian residence by 40, with the aggregate number of years rounded down to a whole number of years.\n[14]\nThe terms \"resided\" and \"residence in Canada\" are not defined in the\nAct\nbut are described in s. 21 of the\nOAS Regulations\n. Certain time abroad may be deemed to be residence in Canada for purposes of the calculation of eligibility for OAS pension. Of particular relevance to this application, a person whose presence in Canada is interrupted to serve as a missionary is deemed resident in Canada during the period of the interruption (s. 21(5)(b)(vi)).\n[15]\nThe\nOAS Regulations\nalso address the situation of spouses or partners of persons whose interruptions satisfy the deeming provisions. Section 21(3) of\nOAS Regulation\nappears to apply in situations where the marriage takes place after the person in missionary service is already abroad and operates to deem the spouse or partner resident from the date of the marriage. Section 21(5) appears to apply when the partner accompanies the person in missionary service throughout his or her service and operates to deem residence for the partner from the date of departure from Canada.\nReview Tribunal's reference to s. 21(5) of the OAS Regulations\n[16]\nVarious provisions of the\nOAS Regulations\napply to permit persons outside of Canada to be deemed resident for purposes of OAS pension calculations. It was not disputed that s. 21(4) and 21(5)(b)(vi) apply to Ms. Stachowski to deem her time served abroad in missionary service as residence for OAS calculation purposes.\n[17]\nBoth s. 21(3) and s. 21(5) of the\nOAS Regulations\napply to situations where a person is out of Canada with a partner who would be deemed resident by virtue of the\nOAS Regulations\n. The obvious intent of these provisions is to allow couples to live abroad together without negative impact on OAS eligibility for the partner who does not qualify under one of the interruption provisions in s. 21(4). The difference between s. 21(3) and (5) appears to be one of timing. If the persons were partners who left Canada together, s. 21(5)(c) applies to deem the time abroad for the accompanying partner as residence. However, if the two persons became partners while the missionary or soldier, for example, was already abroad, s. 21(3) applies.\n[18]\nThe Review Tribunal decision refers only to s. 21(5), a provision that may not be applicable since Mr. Stachowski did not accompany his wife when she left Canada. No reference whatsoever was made to s. 21(3) in the decision, in spite of the fact that Mr. Stachowski's appeal to the tribunal was very clear that he was relying on s. 21(3). Even the submissions of the Minister to the Review Tribunal referred only to s. 21(3).\n[19]\nIt appears that only s. 21(3) could possibly be applicable to Mr. Stachowski. This is because, at the time of his marriage, Mr. Stachowski was not a Canadian resident and was outside Canada. The Respondent acknowledges that the Review Tribunal referred to the wrong provision in its decision but submits that the error is immaterial given that the Review Tribunal clearly put its mind to the correct test for deemed residency. Specifically, the Review Tribunal asked itself whether the\nOAS Regulations\nrequired Mr. Stachowski to have a prior attachment to Canada before the deeming provisions of the\nRegulations\napplied to him.\n[20]\nIs it possible that the Review Tribunal's error in identifying s. 21(5) rather than 21(3) was merely an administrative oversight? As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 81; 100 W.A.C. 81, at paragraph 20, \"Courts are primarily concerned with whether a statutory power exists, not with whether the delegate knew how to locate it\". However, this is not simply a case where the tribunal's analysis could apply if one were to replace s. 21(5) with s. 21(3) where it appears in the decision. The decision of the Review Tribunal turns on the interpretation of the words of the relevant provisions of the Regulations. In its reasons, the Review Tribunal finds support for its decision in the language of s. 21(4) which includes the words \"any interval of absence\" and that of s. 21(5) which refers to \"The absences from Canada referred to in paragraph (4)(c) of a person residing in Canada\". In contrast, s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nsits outside the framework of s. 21(4) and (5). This provision does not refer to any \"interval of absence\"; it is fundamentally different from s. 21(5). The conclusion that I must draw is that the Review Tribunal misapprehended the evidence and directed its mind to the wrong question. Thus, I do not agree with the Respondent's submission that the Review Tribunal put its mind to the correct test. This is not a case contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[21]\nThe Review Tribunal was obliged to consider and interpret the correct provision of its home legislation. It failed to do so. On this basis and regardless of the applicable standard of review, the application should succeed and the matter be referred back to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration of this question. This is not to say that the Review Tribunal could not conclude that s. 21(3) requires an initial period of actual residence in Canada. It may be open to the Review Tribunal, after considering the proper interpretation of s. 21(3) on sound principles of statutory interpretation, to reach the same conclusion.\nIssue #2: Was Mr. Stachowski precluded from being deemed resident in Canada because of his participation in the German mandatory pension scheme?\n[22]\nMr. Stachoski's second ground of appeal to the Review Tribunal was his position that s. 21(5.3) of the Regulations was not applicable to him. That is, Mr. Stachowski does not agree that the periods of time that he participated in the German Social Benefit Plan should be excluded from the operation of s. 21(5).\nReview Tribunal Decision\n[23]\nOn this issue, the Review concluded that the Minister \"correctly applied the provisions of s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nin that the periods of time the Appellant participated in the German Social Benefit Plan are excluded from the operation of s. 21(5).\" The reasons for this result are as follows:\nAgain, the overall concept of the legislation requires residency and s. 21(4) exempts certain periods of absence to continue the person's qualifying residency. The Appellant submitted that s. 21(5.3) is ambiguous and that it does not clearly override or set a priority with respect to the applications of s. 21(4) and (5). We disagree in that the Sections have to be read in their entirety and notice taken of the curative aspects of s. 21(5.3) following the decision in\nBarnes\n. Accordingly s. 21(5.3) which is specific is to be read as overriding the general provisions which come before it, in that it specifically excludes a certain class of persons from the operations of ss. 21(4) and (5). Any other reading would render the operation of the Section nugatory and this is not in keeping with the purpose of the legislation. It is clear that the purpose of the legislation is to ensure that persons are not disadvantaged by the fact that they have only partial periods of residence in two countries and conversely to ensure that persons are not entitled to double benefits as a result of having residences in two countries. The Appellant stated that the German plan is a contributory plan and therefore only akin to the Canada Pension Plan legislation and should not be considered in conjunction with the Old Age Security legislation. With the greatest of respect, we disagree that it clearly is the policy of both Canada Pension Plan and\nOld Age Security Act\nto integrate the plans under both pieces of Canadian legislation with the single regimes of contributory legislation and other jurisdictions including particularly Germany in this case.\n[24]\nUnlike the situation with the first issue in this application, the Review Tribunal appears to have understood and addressed the correct questions. I must determine whether the tribunal erred in concluding that the periods of time Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German pension plan are excluded from the calculation of eligibility for OAS benefits.\nStatutory Scheme\n[25]\nFor purposes of this issue, there are four directly relevant legislative provisions. The full text of the relevant legislation is set out in Appendix A.\n1. The starting point is s. 40 of the\nOAS Act\n. This provision applies where, under the law of a country other than Canada, provision is made for the payment of old age, or other benefits. In these circumstances, the Minister may enter into an agreement with the another country for the making of reciprocal arrangements relating to the administration or operation of the foreign law and the\nOAS Act\n. Section 40 also specifically sets out that any such agreement may provide for the increase or decrease in the amount of benefits payable under the foreign law or the\nOAS Act\n.\n2. Section 41 provides that, from the day it comes into force, any such agreement \"has the force of law in Canada\" so long as the agreement remains in force.\n3. By Agreement dated November 14, 1985 (in force April 1, 1988), Canada entered into an agreement entitled \"SOCIAL SECURITY, Agreement between CANADA and the FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY\" (the \"Canada/Germany Agreement\"). Of particular relevance to the question in this application, Article 11(b) provides that, for the purposes of the\nOAS Act\n, if a person is subject to the German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage during any period of residence in Canada, that period shall not be considered as a period of residence in Canada.\n4. The\nOAS Regulations\nalso address this issue providing in s. 21(5.3) that, where, \"by virtue of an agreement entered into under subsection 40(1)\", a person is subject to the legislation of a foreign country, the person will \"be deemed not to be resident in Canada\".\n[26]\nThe full text of the relevant provisions is set out in Appendix A.\nMr. Stachowski's Situation\n[27]\nIn spite of able representations by counsel for Mr. Stachowski, I can see no other possible interpretation of these provisions than that adopted by the Review Tribunal.\n[28]\nFor purposes of this question, I have assumed, without deciding, that the first issue is resolved in favour of Mr. Stachowski. That is, the period of time he was abroad, from 1968, when he married, to 1991, when he was landed in Canada, was \"residence and presence in Canada\" as contemplated by the\nOAS Act\nand the\nOAS Regulations\n.\n[29]\nBetween 1968 and 1988, Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German Social Benefit Plan. I accept (and there is no evidence to the contrary) that this plan is mandatory.\n[30]\nMr. Stachowski argues that he was subject to the German legislation\nby virtue\nof his German citizenship and residence in Germany, and not\nby virtue\nof the Canada/Germany Agreement and that s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nonly applies where a person qualifies for benefits in a country which they would not otherwise have qualified for but for the Canada/Germany Agreement. Mr. Stachowski submits that the provision cannot operate where a person is entitled to benefits independent of the Canada/Germany Agreement. In this case, he argues that he is eligible for benefits pursuant to s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n.\n[31]\nIn essence, Mr. Stachowski argues that, since he has been deemed resident pursuant to s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n, he cannot be \"undeemed\" by another provision of the\nRegulations\n. I do not agree with this interpretation.\n[32]\nThe principal difficulty with the interpretation urged on me by Mr. Stachowski is that it ignores all other legislative provisions where this issue is addressed. As noted above, the words of a statute are to be read in their entire context. Here, that context involves not only the words of s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, but the words of the enabling statute and, in this case, the Canada/Germany Agreement.\n[33]\nGuidance on how to undertake this task was provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In that case, the Court was considering the interpretation of certain provisions of the\nNational Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations\n, SOR/91-7. As noted by Justice Décary, at paragraph 11:\nNormally, in cases such as this one, the Court will examine the provisions of the enabling statute first in order to ascertain precisely what it is that Parliament has allowed to be regulated. It will then turn to the regulation.\nThere being a presumption that the regulation has been passed in accordance with the provisions of the enabling statute and that there is coherence between the terms used in the statute and those used in the regulation, the Court will endeavour to interpret the regulation in such a way as to keep it within the confines permitted by the enabling statute.\nShould that prove impossible, the regulation or part of it will be declared ultra vires. Reconciliation is therefore the rule, and it will be achieved in most cases. (Emphasis added)\n[34]\nIn the situation before me, I begin with the provisions of the\nOAS Act\n. The authority of the Minister to enter into the Canada/Germany Agreement arises from the operation of s. 40. Section 41 gives the Governor in Council the ability, by order, to declare the Agreement in force. This was done (\nProclamation Declaring the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany in Force April 1, 1988\n, SI/88-127, C. Gaz. 1988.II). With the Proclamation, the Canada/Germany Agreement, including Article 11(b), has the force of law in Canada (\nOAS Act\n, s. 41(1)). The power of the Governor in Council to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the Agreement is set out in s. 40(2). This was done as evidenced by s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. As taught by\nOntario Hydro\n, s. 21(5.3) must be interpreted such that there is \"coherence\" between this provision and Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement.\n[35]\nArticle 11(b) is, in my view, plainly applicable to Mr. Stachowski. Until 1988, Mr. Stachowski was subject to German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage, as contemplated by Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement. Accordingly, the period from 1968 to 1988 \"shall not be considered as a period of residence in Canada\".\n[36]\nThe interpretation promoted by Mr. Stachowski causes an incongruous collision between Article 11(b) of the Agreement and s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. If I apply the logic of Mr. Stachowski's submissions, I am obliged to \"read down\" Article 11(b) such that it does not apply if the person's residency is \"deemed residency\" and not actual residency. Those words are not in Article 11(b); they should not be read into s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. It does not matter whether Mr. Stachowski's residence is established by physical presence (s. 21(1)) or by the operation of other provisions in s. 21 of the\nOAS Regulations\n. In either case, Article 11(b) applies such that the period from 1968 to 1988 cannot be considered to be residence.\n[37]\nSection 21 of the\nRegulations\ncontains a number of different deeming provisions. To the extent there appears to be a conflict between any two of them, the principles of statutory interpretation teach us that we should look to the whole legislative scheme for help. In this case, assuming that s. 21(3) deems Mr. Stachowki to be resident, s. 21(5.3), in the submission of Mr. Stachowski, appears to say the opposite. If so, the result would be a conflict between two provisions of the\nRegulations\n. However, I am of the opinion that these provisions can be read harmoniously, in a way that achieves the objectives of the\nAct\nand the Agreement, which as I discuss below is partly to avoid the conferment of double benefits.\n[38]\nAs noted by Mr. Stachowski, he was subject to the German legislation\nby virtue\nof his German citizenship and residence in Germany, and not\nby virtue\nof the Canada/Germany Agreement. The words \"by virtue of an agreement\" in s. 21(5.3) appear to be misplaced. It is nonsensical to describe a person as being subject to the legislation of a country by virtue of a bi-lateral agreement. Obviously, Mr. Stachowski is subject to the German legislation by virtue of his citizenship and residency over the years pursuant to the applicable legislation of that country. But this odd drafting of the\nRegulation\ndoes not, in my view, mean that Mr. Stachowski's interpretation should be adopted; rather, it makes it even more important that the context of the entire legislative scheme be examined.\n[39]\nI turn to the purpose of these statutory provisions. The arrangements made by Canada and Germany are, in part, designed to avoid the situation where a senior citizen claims benefits under both Canadian and German laws. If I interpret the\nRegulations\nin the manner suggested by Mr. Stachowski, he will receive pension benefits from both countries related to the period of 1968 to 1988. This cannot be the intended result of the legislative scheme. I have reviewed the House of Commons debates concerning amendments to the\nAct\nwhich brought in s. 40 and the reciprocal OAS agreement scheme. During one such debate, it was expressed by the Hon. Marc Lalonde that:\n[t]he central purpose of reciprocal international agreements is to protect migrants who spend portions of their working lives in more than one country. Such people cannot always meet the minimum eligibility requirements of the mandatory social security programs to which they have contributed.\n. . . . .\nInternational agreement also provide for the removal of duplicate coverage [House of Commons Debates, (February 9, 1977) at 2835 (Hon. Marc Lalonde)].\nThe Hon. Mr. Lincoln Alexander also stated that\nAnother point is that by simple agreement we will remove duplicate social security coverage.\n. . . . .\nLet me emphasize that in the absence of reciprocal agreement immigrants will continue to be deprived of benefits earned in their former countries of residence [Ibid. at 2842 (Hon. Lincoln M. Alexander)].\nUpon my reading of the debates, and particularly in light of the portions excerpted above, it is my understanding that the reciprocal OAS agreement scheme was implemented to ensure that foreign nationals who immigrate to Canada, often late in their lives, receive\nsome\nform of adequate old age security, rather than be deprived of security related to a period of time during which they may have paid into a foreign OAS system. I also comprehend that this system was intended to prevent \"duplicate social security coverage.\"\n[40]\nSections 21(3) and 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, in conjunction with Article (11)(b) of the Agreement, work together to achieve both purposes outlined in the House of Commons debates. If Article 11(b) and s. 21(5.3) are read to apply to all residents, including \"deemed residents\" such as Mr. Stachowski, then duplicate coverage is avoided. On the other hand, in the absence of an OAS agreement between Canada and the former country of residence of the claimant, s. 21(5.3) would not activate and that claimant would be entitled to Canadian OAS benefits calculated from over a longer period. In both situations, a senior citizen receives benefits, relating to a given period of residence, from at least one country\nand only\none country.\n[41]\nIt could be said that s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nand Article 11(b) of the Agreement appear redundant, and in light of the maxim of statutory interpretation that Parliament is presumed not to be redundant, the interpretation proffered above runs afoul of that rule. To that argument, I say that s. 21(5.3) is only redundant in the specific context of the Canada/Germany Agreement. There may very well be OAS agreements which do not include a provision like Article 11(b), which would then be \"caught\" by s. 21(5.3) to block duplicate benefits. The drafter of s. 21(5.3) could not have anticipated the content of every international agreement that Canada would later enter into with foreign countries, and s. 21(5.3) acts as a safety net in that regard.\n[42]\nIn conclusion, the interpretation that best fits the context as a whole is that the period during which Mr. Stachowski paid into the mandatory German Social Benefit Plan cannot be considered residency for purposes of calculating his OAS benefits entitlement. This is so whether Mr. Stachowski is deemed resident pursuant to s. 21(3) or is physically present in Canada.\n[43]\nIn summary, Mr. Stachowski was subject to the German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage during the period of time between 1968 and 1988 when he alleges that he was resident in Canada pursuant to the provisions of the\nRegulations\n. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 11 of the Canada/Germany Agreement and s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, this period of time cannot be considered to be a period of residency for OAS purposes. The Review Tribunal was correct in its interpretation of the legislative scheme and its conclusion on this issue.\nConclusion\n[44]\nIn conclusion, the Review Tribunal erred due to its failure to consider the applicability of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nto Mr. Stachowski's situation. However, the Review Tribunal correctly determined that Mr. Stachowski is deemed not to be resident in Canada for the period from 1968 to 1988 because of his contributions to the German mandatory pension scheme.\n[45]\nAccordingly, the matter should be remitted to a differently constituted panel of the Review Tribunal. Because Mr. Stachowski was not successful on the second issue, the Review Tribunal need only address the question of the correct interpretation of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nand its applicability to the calculation of Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension benefits. In effect, the only period of time that needs to be considered by the Review Tribunal is the period from when Mr. Stachowski's contributions to the German pension scheme ceased in 1988 to the date when he landed in Canada in 1991.\n[46]\nAs Mr. Stachowski's success was only partial, in my discretion, there will be no award of costs.\nORDER\n[47]\nThis court orders that:\n1. The Decision of the Review Tribunal that \"in order to obtain qualifying deemed residence the spouse of the missionary must have an initial period of actual residence in Canada as required by the\nAct\nand\nRegulations\nin order to trigger the benefit of s. 21(5)(c)\" is quashed and this matter remitted to a different panel of the Review Tribunal for reconsideration.\n2. The application for judicial review is dismissed with respect to the others matters before the Review Tribunal.\n3. There is no order as to costs.\nApplication allowed in part.\nEditor: Jana A.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nSnider, J.\n: Mr. Stachowski, a resident of Canada since July, 1991, applied for an Old Age Security (\"OAS\") pension under the\nOld Age Security Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. O-8 (the \"\nOAS Act\n\"). The Minister of Human Resources Development Canada (now the Minister of Social Development) determined that Mr. Stachowski was entitled to an OAS pension of 5/40ths of a full OAS pension, limiting his entitlement to his residency in Canada between 1991 and 1996. Believing that he is entitled to a full OAS pension, based on \"deemed residency\" for the period between 1968 and 1991, Mr. Stachowski appealed that decision to the Canada Pension Plan - Old Age Security Review Tribunal (the \"Review Tribunal\"). The Review Tribunal, in a decision dated October 4, 2004, dismissed his appeal. Mr. Stachowski seeks judicial review of the decision of the Review Tribunal.\nIssues\n\n[2]\nThe overarching issue in this application is whether the Review Tribunal erred in concluding that the period between 1968 and 1991 did not count towards the calculation of Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension. The response to this question requires that I address the following:\n1. In order to obtain qualifying deemed residence for purposes of calculating OAS pension benefits, do the\nOAS Act\nand the\nOld Age Security Regulations\n, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1246, as amended (the \"\nRegulations\n\") require that the spouse of a person abroad on missionary service have an initial period of actual residence in Canada? Stated in other words directly applicable to Mr. Stachowski, is the period of time from 1968, when Mr. Stachowski married a person deemed to be resident in Canada, to 1991, when he became a landed immigrant in Canada, \"residence\" for purposes of calculating Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension, notwithstanding that he had no period of initial residence in Canada before 1968?\n2. Is Mr. Stachowski deemed not to be resident in Canada for the period from 1968 to 1988 because of his contributions to the German mandatory pension scheme?\nFacts\n\n[3]\nThe material facts are not disputed. In summary form, they are as follows:\n- Mr. Stachowski is a German citizen who was born in Poland on October 6, 1931.\n- On July 25, 1968, he was married, in Germany, to Erika Martha Sommerfeld.\n- Ms. Stachowski lived in Canada, as a legal resident, from January, 1953 to 1961. The Review Tribunal accepted (and this was not disputed by the Respondent in this application) that Ms. Stachowski's period of interruption in residence from 1961 until 1989, during which time she was engaged in studies followed by missionary work, is deemed as residency for OAS calculation purposes, pursuant to s. 21(5)(b)(vi) of the\nOAS Regulations\n. (Because of her long absence from Canada, however, Ms. Stachowski was required to reapply for residence in Canada; this issue is not material to this application.)\n- Mr. Stachowski and his wife worked in missionary service, in a number of countries, until 1988 (Mr. Stachowski) and 1989 (Ms. Stachowksi).\n- Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German Social Security System from 1948 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1988 and began receiving a German Pension on June 23, 1995.\n- Mr. Stachowski was admitted to Canada as a landed immigrant in July, 1991.\n- Mr. Stachowski applied for OAS pension on June 21, 2001.\nMr. Stachowski's Calculation\n\n[4]\nMr. Stachowski has argued to the Minister, the Review Tribunal and this Court that he is entitled to a full monthly OAS pension commencing November, 1996. In his revised Notice of Appeal to the Review Tribunal, he described his entitlement as follows:\n(a) attained sixty-five years of age prior to that date,\n(b) submitted my application for German benefits on June 23, 1995,\n(c) On the 1st day of January, 1977, I was considered to be resident and present in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n,\n(d) I resided in Canada for 8 years, 11 months and 9 days prior to the day my application for a pension was approved and I was considered to be present in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nfor more that three years and sixty-six days prior to yen years immediately preceding the day on which my application was approved, and\n(e) I resided in Canada for more than one year immediately preceding the day on which my application for a pension was approved.\n\n[5]\nBut for two questions, Mr. Stachowski's interpretation of his entitlement would be correct. First, under (c), was he \"considered to be a resident in Canada by virtue of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n\"? Secondly, does his payment into the German Social Security System between 1948 and 1988 impact on the calculation? These, of course, are the issues that were before the Review Tribunal and which are before me in this application.\nAnalysis\nStandard of Review\n\n[6]\nThe questions raised by this application require the interpretation of relevant provisions of the\nOAS Act\nand\nRegulations\n. To the extent that these are questions of pure law and do not require an application of the facts to that law, the parties agree that the applicable standard of review is correctness.\nPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation\n\n[7]\nSince issues of statutory interpretation are at the heart of this dispute, it is useful to begin with an overview of the principles related to such matters. On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court of Canada has given guidance on how to approach a problem of statutory interpretation. In\nRizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re\n, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1, at paragraph 21, Mr. Justice Iacobucci, speaking for the unanimous Court, endorsed the statement of Elmer Driedger in\nDriedger on the Construction of Statutes\n, 2nd Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1983), that:\nToday there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.\n\n[8]\nAccordingly, the task of the Court in interpreting legislation cannot be restricted to analysing the plain meaning of the provision in question. Further, while the statutory words must be given a \"fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objectives\" (\nInterpretation Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 12), attention must be directed to the scheme and objective of the\nAct\n, the intention of the legislature, and the context of the words in issue (\nRizzo\n, supra, at para. 23). The Court in\nRizzo\n, supra, at para. 31, approved of the use of legislative history as a tool for determining the intention of the legislature. And, regardless of how clear and unambiguous the words of a provision may be, the further analysis must be carried out. Indeed, a failure to determine the intention of the legislature in enacting a particular provision has been found to be an error (\nRizzo\n, supra, at paras. 23, 31). It follows that, where there are conflicting but not unreasonable interpretations available, the contextual framework of the legislation becomes even more important.\nIssue #1: Was Mr. Stachowski deemed resident of Canada from the date of his marriage in 1968?\nReview Tribunal Decision\n\n[9]\nMr. Stachowski's submissions to the Review Tribunal were, as before me, based on two arguments. The first of these is that s. 21(3) of the\nOAS Regulations\napplies to his situation on the basis that he returned to Canada with his wife within six months of terminating his missionary service abroad. In Mr. Stachowski's submission, he became deemed to be resident in Canada for OAS purposes upon his marriage. He argues that, if s. 21(3) requires a non-resident to have been resident in Canada prior to completing missionary service, the provision would be \"virtually inoperative\".\n\n[10]\nThe Review Tribunal did not accept Mr. Stachowski's submissions. Its reasons were as follows:\nThe overriding entitlement of the Old Age Security regime is residence in Canada. The provisions of s. 21(4) of the\nRegulations\ndeems certain intervals or absence from Canada to be continued residence even though the person is not actually physically in Canada. Accordingly s. 21(4) of the\nRegulations\ncontinues to import a requirement that the person initially be in Canada and then excludes any interval of absence from Canada, not to have interrupted that person's residence or presence in Canada. Accordingly the Appellant's submission that the provision would be rendered nugatory, is not accepted by the panel, as there would clearly be situations where a couple leaves Canada to serve outside Canada but only one acts as a missionary. The non-missionary spouse would but for the provision of s. 21(5)(c) of the\nRegulations\nlose qualifying residency for the purposes of entitlement to benefits under the\nAct\n. A spouse of the missionary would continue to earn eligibility for Old Age Security by virtue of the deemed residence provided in s. 21(5)(c) of the\nRegulations\n.\nIn order to obtain qualifying deemed residence the spouse of the missionary must have an initial period of actual residence in Canada as required by the\nAct\nand\nRegulations\nin order to trigger the benefit of s. 21(5)(c).\n (Emphasis added)\nStatutory Scheme\n\n[11]\nSection 3 of the\nOAS Act\nprovides for the payment of a full or partial monthly pension to persons 65 years or older. The full text of this and other statutory provisions relevant to this application are attached as Appendix A to these reasons.\n\n[12]\nResidency in Canada is the key to the OAS pension. Entitlement to and the amount of the pension depends on the number of years a claimant has resided in Canada after reaching the age of 18. Normally, a full pension is paid after 40 years of residence in Canada (or deemed residence, as discussed later in these reasons). However, under the special circumstances described in s. 3(1)(b) of the\nOAS Act\n, a claimant may still be eligible for a full pension with fewer than 40 years of residence. This provision is referred to as the \"3-for-1 Rule\".\n\n[13]\nThe\nOAS Act\nalso authorizes the payment of a partial monthly pension for certain persons who do not qualify for a full monthly pension. Such partial payments are set out in s. 3(2) and (3) of the\nOAS Act\n. The amount of a partial pension is determined by dividing the number of years of Canadian residence by 40, with the aggregate number of years rounded down to a whole number of years.\n\n[14]\nThe terms \"resided\" and \"residence in Canada\" are not defined in the\nAct\nbut are described in s. 21 of the\nOAS Regulations\n. Certain time abroad may be deemed to be residence in Canada for purposes of the calculation of eligibility for OAS pension. Of particular relevance to this application, a person whose presence in Canada is interrupted to serve as a missionary is deemed resident in Canada during the period of the interruption (s. 21(5)(b)(vi)).\n\n[15]\nThe\nOAS Regulations\nalso address the situation of spouses or partners of persons whose interruptions satisfy the deeming provisions. Section 21(3) of\nOAS Regulation\nappears to apply in situations where the marriage takes place after the person in missionary service is already abroad and operates to deem the spouse or partner resident from the date of the marriage. Section 21(5) appears to apply when the partner accompanies the person in missionary service throughout his or her service and operates to deem residence for the partner from the date of departure from Canada.\nReview Tribunal's reference to s. 21(5) of the OAS Regulations\n\n[16]\nVarious provisions of the\nOAS Regulations\napply to permit persons outside of Canada to be deemed resident for purposes of OAS pension calculations. It was not disputed that s. 21(4) and 21(5)(b)(vi) apply to Ms. Stachowski to deem her time served abroad in missionary service as residence for OAS calculation purposes.\n\n[17]\nBoth s. 21(3) and s. 21(5) of the\nOAS Regulations\napply to situations where a person is out of Canada with a partner who would be deemed resident by virtue of the\nOAS Regulations\n. The obvious intent of these provisions is to allow couples to live abroad together without negative impact on OAS eligibility for the partner who does not qualify under one of the interruption provisions in s. 21(4). The difference between s. 21(3) and (5) appears to be one of timing. If the persons were partners who left Canada together, s. 21(5)(c) applies to deem the time abroad for the accompanying partner as residence. However, if the two persons became partners while the missionary or soldier, for example, was already abroad, s. 21(3) applies.\n\n[18]\nThe Review Tribunal decision refers only to s. 21(5), a provision that may not be applicable since Mr. Stachowski did not accompany his wife when she left Canada. No reference whatsoever was made to s. 21(3) in the decision, in spite of the fact that Mr. Stachowski's appeal to the tribunal was very clear that he was relying on s. 21(3). Even the submissions of the Minister to the Review Tribunal referred only to s. 21(3).\n\n[19]\nIt appears that only s. 21(3) could possibly be applicable to Mr. Stachowski. This is because, at the time of his marriage, Mr. Stachowski was not a Canadian resident and was outside Canada. The Respondent acknowledges that the Review Tribunal referred to the wrong provision in its decision but submits that the error is immaterial given that the Review Tribunal clearly put its mind to the correct test for deemed residency. Specifically, the Review Tribunal asked itself whether the\nOAS Regulations\nrequired Mr. Stachowski to have a prior attachment to Canada before the deeming provisions of the\nRegulations\napplied to him.\n\n[20]\nIs it possible that the Review Tribunal's error in identifying s. 21(5) rather than 21(3) was merely an administrative oversight? As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  B.C.A.C. 81; 100 W.A.C. 81, at paragraph 20, \"Courts are primarily concerned with whether a statutory power exists, not with whether the delegate knew how to locate it\". However, this is not simply a case where the tribunal's analysis could apply if one were to replace s. 21(5) with s. 21(3) where it appears in the decision. The decision of the Review Tribunal turns on the interpretation of the words of the relevant provisions of the Regulations. In its reasons, the Review Tribunal finds support for its decision in the language of s. 21(4) which includes the words \"any interval of absence\" and that of s. 21(5) which refers to \"The absences from Canada referred to in paragraph (4)(c) of a person residing in Canada\". In contrast, s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nsits outside the framework of s. 21(4) and (5). This provision does not refer to any \"interval of absence\"; it is fundamentally different from s. 21(5). The conclusion that I must draw is that the Review Tribunal misapprehended the evidence and directed its mind to the wrong question. Thus, I do not agree with the Respondent's submission that the Review Tribunal put its mind to the correct test. This is not a case contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n\n[21]\nThe Review Tribunal was obliged to consider and interpret the correct provision of its home legislation. It failed to do so. On this basis and regardless of the applicable standard of review, the application should succeed and the matter be referred back to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration of this question. This is not to say that the Review Tribunal could not conclude that s. 21(3) requires an initial period of actual residence in Canada. It may be open to the Review Tribunal, after considering the proper interpretation of s. 21(3) on sound principles of statutory interpretation, to reach the same conclusion.\nIssue #2: Was Mr. Stachowski precluded from being deemed resident in Canada because of his participation in the German mandatory pension scheme?\n\n[22]\nMr. Stachoski's second ground of appeal to the Review Tribunal was his position that s. 21(5.3) of the Regulations was not applicable to him. That is, Mr. Stachowski does not agree that the periods of time that he participated in the German Social Benefit Plan should be excluded from the operation of s. 21(5).\nReview Tribunal Decision\n\n[23]\nOn this issue, the Review concluded that the Minister \"correctly applied the provisions of s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nin that the periods of time the Appellant participated in the German Social Benefit Plan are excluded from the operation of s. 21(5).\" The reasons for this result are as follows:\nAgain, the overall concept of the legislation requires residency and s. 21(4) exempts certain periods of absence to continue the person's qualifying residency. The Appellant submitted that s. 21(5.3) is ambiguous and that it does not clearly override or set a priority with respect to the applications of s. 21(4) and (5). We disagree in that the Sections have to be read in their entirety and notice taken of the curative aspects of s. 21(5.3) following the decision in\nBarnes\n. Accordingly s. 21(5.3) which is specific is to be read as overriding the general provisions which come before it, in that it specifically excludes a certain class of persons from the operations of ss. 21(4) and (5). Any other reading would render the operation of the Section nugatory and this is not in keeping with the purpose of the legislation. It is clear that the purpose of the legislation is to ensure that persons are not disadvantaged by the fact that they have only partial periods of residence in two countries and conversely to ensure that persons are not entitled to double benefits as a result of having residences in two countries. The Appellant stated that the German plan is a contributory plan and therefore only akin to the Canada Pension Plan legislation and should not be considered in conjunction with the Old Age Security legislation. With the greatest of respect, we disagree that it clearly is the policy of both Canada Pension Plan and\nOld Age Security Act\nto integrate the plans under both pieces of Canadian legislation with the single regimes of contributory legislation and other jurisdictions including particularly Germany in this case.\n\n[24]\nUnlike the situation with the first issue in this application, the Review Tribunal appears to have understood and addressed the correct questions. I must determine whether the tribunal erred in concluding that the periods of time Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German pension plan are excluded from the calculation of eligibility for OAS benefits.\nStatutory Scheme\n\n[25]\nFor purposes of this issue, there are four directly relevant legislative provisions. The full text of the relevant legislation is set out in Appendix A.\n1. The starting point is s. 40 of the\nOAS Act\n. This provision applies where, under the law of a country other than Canada, provision is made for the payment of old age, or other benefits. In these circumstances, the Minister may enter into an agreement with the another country for the making of reciprocal arrangements relating to the administration or operation of the foreign law and the\nOAS Act\n. Section 40 also specifically sets out that any such agreement may provide for the increase or decrease in the amount of benefits payable under the foreign law or the\nOAS Act\n.\n2. Section 41 provides that, from the day it comes into force, any such agreement \"has the force of law in Canada\" so long as the agreement remains in force.\n3. By Agreement dated November 14, 1985 (in force April 1, 1988), Canada entered into an agreement entitled \"SOCIAL SECURITY, Agreement between CANADA and the FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY\" (the \"Canada/Germany Agreement\"). Of particular relevance to the question in this application, Article 11(b) provides that, for the purposes of the\nOAS Act\n, if a person is subject to the German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage during any period of residence in Canada, that period shall not be considered as a period of residence in Canada.\n4. The\nOAS Regulations\nalso address this issue providing in s. 21(5.3) that, where, \"by virtue of an agreement entered into under subsection 40(1)\", a person is subject to the legislation of a foreign country, the person will \"be deemed not to be resident in Canada\".\n\n[26]\nThe full text of the relevant provisions is set out in Appendix A.\nMr. Stachowski's Situation\n\n[27]\nIn spite of able representations by counsel for Mr. Stachowski, I can see no other possible interpretation of these provisions than that adopted by the Review Tribunal.\n\n[28]\nFor purposes of this question, I have assumed, without deciding, that the first issue is resolved in favour of Mr. Stachowski. That is, the period of time he was abroad, from 1968, when he married, to 1991, when he was landed in Canada, was \"residence and presence in Canada\" as contemplated by the\nOAS Act\nand the\nOAS Regulations\n.\n\n[29]\nBetween 1968 and 1988, Mr. Stachowski contributed to the German Social Benefit Plan. I accept (and there is no evidence to the contrary) that this plan is mandatory.\n\n[30]\nMr. Stachowski argues that he was subject to the German legislation\nby virtue\nof his German citizenship and residence in Germany, and not\nby virtue\nof the Canada/Germany Agreement and that s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nonly applies where a person qualifies for benefits in a country which they would not otherwise have qualified for but for the Canada/Germany Agreement. Mr. Stachowski submits that the provision cannot operate where a person is entitled to benefits independent of the Canada/Germany Agreement. In this case, he argues that he is eligible for benefits pursuant to s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n.\n\n[31]\nIn essence, Mr. Stachowski argues that, since he has been deemed resident pursuant to s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\n, he cannot be \"undeemed\" by another provision of the\nRegulations\n. I do not agree with this interpretation.\n\n[32]\nThe principal difficulty with the interpretation urged on me by Mr. Stachowski is that it ignores all other legislative provisions where this issue is addressed. As noted above, the words of a statute are to be read in their entire context. Here, that context involves not only the words of s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, but the words of the enabling statute and, in this case, the Canada/Germany Agreement.\n\n[33]\nGuidance on how to undertake this task was provided by the Federal Court of Appeal in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). In that case, the Court was considering the interpretation of certain provisions of the\nNational Energy Board Cost Recovery Regulations\n, SOR/91-7. As noted by Justice Décary, at paragraph 11:\nNormally, in cases such as this one, the Court will examine the provisions of the enabling statute first in order to ascertain precisely what it is that Parliament has allowed to be regulated. It will then turn to the regulation.\nThere being a presumption that the regulation has been passed in accordance with the provisions of the enabling statute and that there is coherence between the terms used in the statute and those used in the regulation, the Court will endeavour to interpret the regulation in such a way as to keep it within the confines permitted by the enabling statute.\nShould that prove impossible, the regulation or part of it will be declared ultra vires. Reconciliation is therefore the rule, and it will be achieved in most cases. (Emphasis added)\n\n[34]\nIn the situation before me, I begin with the provisions of the\nOAS Act\n. The authority of the Minister to enter into the Canada/Germany Agreement arises from the operation of s. 40. Section 41 gives the Governor in Council the ability, by order, to declare the Agreement in force. This was done (\nProclamation Declaring the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Federal Republic of Germany in Force April 1, 1988\n, SI/88-127, C. Gaz. 1988.II). With the Proclamation, the Canada/Germany Agreement, including Article 11(b), has the force of law in Canada (\nOAS Act\n, s. 41(1)). The power of the Governor in Council to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the Agreement is set out in s. 40(2). This was done as evidenced by s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. As taught by\nOntario Hydro\n, s. 21(5.3) must be interpreted such that there is \"coherence\" between this provision and Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement.\n\n[35]\nArticle 11(b) is, in my view, plainly applicable to Mr. Stachowski. Until 1988, Mr. Stachowski was subject to German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage, as contemplated by Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement. Accordingly, the period from 1968 to 1988 \"shall not be considered as a period of residence in Canada\".\n\n[36]\nThe interpretation promoted by Mr. Stachowski causes an incongruous collision between Article 11(b) of the Agreement and s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. If I apply the logic of Mr. Stachowski's submissions, I am obliged to \"read down\" Article 11(b) such that it does not apply if the person's residency is \"deemed residency\" and not actual residency. Those words are not in Article 11(b); they should not be read into s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n. It does not matter whether Mr. Stachowski's residence is established by physical presence (s. 21(1)) or by the operation of other provisions in s. 21 of the\nOAS Regulations\n. In either case, Article 11(b) applies such that the period from 1968 to 1988 cannot be considered to be residence.\n\n[37]\nSection 21 of the\nRegulations\ncontains a number of different deeming provisions. To the extent there appears to be a conflict between any two of them, the principles of statutory interpretation teach us that we should look to the whole legislative scheme for help. In this case, assuming that s. 21(3) deems Mr. Stachowki to be resident, s. 21(5.3), in the submission of Mr. Stachowski, appears to say the opposite. If so, the result would be a conflict between two provisions of the\nRegulations\n. However, I am of the opinion that these provisions can be read harmoniously, in a way that achieves the objectives of the\nAct\nand the Agreement, which as I discuss below is partly to avoid the conferment of double benefits.\n\n[38]\nAs noted by Mr. Stachowski, he was subject to the German legislation\nby virtue\nof his German citizenship and residence in Germany, and not\nby virtue\nof the Canada/Germany Agreement. The words \"by virtue of an agreement\" in s. 21(5.3) appear to be misplaced. It is nonsensical to describe a person as being subject to the legislation of a country by virtue of a bi-lateral agreement. Obviously, Mr. Stachowski is subject to the German legislation by virtue of his citizenship and residency over the years pursuant to the applicable legislation of that country. But this odd drafting of the\nRegulation\ndoes not, in my view, mean that Mr. Stachowski's interpretation should be adopted; rather, it makes it even more important that the context of the entire legislative scheme be examined.\n\n[39]\nI turn to the purpose of these statutory provisions. The arrangements made by Canada and Germany are, in part, designed to avoid the situation where a senior citizen claims benefits under both Canadian and German laws. If I interpret the\nRegulations\nin the manner suggested by Mr. Stachowski, he will receive pension benefits from both countries related to the period of 1968 to 1988. This cannot be the intended result of the legislative scheme. I have reviewed the House of Commons debates concerning amendments to the\nAct\nwhich brought in s. 40 and the reciprocal OAS agreement scheme. During one such debate, it was expressed by the Hon. Marc Lalonde that:\n[t]he central purpose of reciprocal international agreements is to protect migrants who spend portions of their working lives in more than one country. Such people cannot always meet the minimum eligibility requirements of the mandatory social security programs to which they have contributed.\n. . . . .\nInternational agreement also provide for the removal of duplicate coverage [House of Commons Debates, (February 9, 1977) at 2835 (Hon. Marc Lalonde)].\nThe Hon. Mr. Lincoln Alexander also stated that\nAnother point is that by simple agreement we will remove duplicate social security coverage.\n. . . . .\nLet me emphasize that in the absence of reciprocal agreement immigrants will continue to be deprived of benefits earned in their former countries of residence [Ibid. at 2842 (Hon. Lincoln M. Alexander)].\nUpon my reading of the debates, and particularly in light of the portions excerpted above, it is my understanding that the reciprocal OAS agreement scheme was implemented to ensure that foreign nationals who immigrate to Canada, often late in their lives, receive\nsome\nform of adequate old age security, rather than be deprived of security related to a period of time during which they may have paid into a foreign OAS system. I also comprehend that this system was intended to prevent \"duplicate social security coverage.\"\n\n[40]\nSections 21(3) and 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, in conjunction with Article (11)(b) of the Agreement, work together to achieve both purposes outlined in the House of Commons debates. If Article 11(b) and s. 21(5.3) are read to apply to all residents, including \"deemed residents\" such as Mr. Stachowski, then duplicate coverage is avoided. On the other hand, in the absence of an OAS agreement between Canada and the former country of residence of the claimant, s. 21(5.3) would not activate and that claimant would be entitled to Canadian OAS benefits calculated from over a longer period. In both situations, a senior citizen receives benefits, relating to a given period of residence, from at least one country\nand only\none country.\n\n[41]\nIt could be said that s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\nand Article 11(b) of the Agreement appear redundant, and in light of the maxim of statutory interpretation that Parliament is presumed not to be redundant, the interpretation proffered above runs afoul of that rule. To that argument, I say that s. 21(5.3) is only redundant in the specific context of the Canada/Germany Agreement. There may very well be OAS agreements which do not include a provision like Article 11(b), which would then be \"caught\" by s. 21(5.3) to block duplicate benefits. The drafter of s. 21(5.3) could not have anticipated the content of every international agreement that Canada would later enter into with foreign countries, and s. 21(5.3) acts as a safety net in that regard.\n\n[42]\nIn conclusion, the interpretation that best fits the context as a whole is that the period during which Mr. Stachowski paid into the mandatory German Social Benefit Plan cannot be considered residency for purposes of calculating his OAS benefits entitlement. This is so whether Mr. Stachowski is deemed resident pursuant to s. 21(3) or is physically present in Canada.\n\n[43]\nIn summary, Mr. Stachowski was subject to the German legislation regarding mandatory pension coverage during the period of time between 1968 and 1988 when he alleges that he was resident in Canada pursuant to the provisions of the\nRegulations\n. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 11 of the Canada/Germany Agreement and s. 21(5.3) of the\nRegulations\n, this period of time cannot be considered to be a period of residency for OAS purposes. The Review Tribunal was correct in its interpretation of the legislative scheme and its conclusion on this issue.\nConclusion\n\n[44]\nIn conclusion, the Review Tribunal erred due to its failure to consider the applicability of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nto Mr. Stachowski's situation. However, the Review Tribunal correctly determined that Mr. Stachowski is deemed not to be resident in Canada for the period from 1968 to 1988 because of his contributions to the German mandatory pension scheme.\n\n[45]\nAccordingly, the matter should be remitted to a differently constituted panel of the Review Tribunal. Because Mr. Stachowski was not successful on the second issue, the Review Tribunal need only address the question of the correct interpretation of s. 21(3) of the\nRegulations\nand its applicability to the calculation of Mr. Stachowski's OAS pension benefits. In effect, the only period of time that needs to be considered by the Review Tribunal is the period from when Mr. Stachowski's contributions to the German pension scheme ceased in 1988 to the date when he landed in Canada in 1991.\n\n[46]\nAs Mr. Stachowski's success was only partial, in my discretion, there will be no award of costs.\nORDER\n\n[47]\nThis court orders that:\n1. The Decision of the Review Tribunal that \"in order to obtain qualifying deemed residence the spouse of the missionary must have an initial period of actual residence in Canada as required by the\nAct\nand\nRegulations\nin order to trigger the benefit of s. 21(5)(c)\" is quashed and this matter remitted to a different panel of the Review Tribunal for reconsideration.\n2. The application for judicial review is dismissed with respect to the others matters before the Review Tribunal.\n3. There is no order as to costs.\nApplication allowed in part.\nEditor: Jana A. Andersen/gs\nAPPENDIX \"A\"\nto the\nReasons for Order and Order dated October 26, 2005\nIn\nMR. LEONHARD STACHOWSKI\nand\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\nT-1944-04\nOld Age Security Act\n,\n3(1) Subject to this Act and the regulations, a full monthly pension may be paid to\n(a) every person who was a pensioner on July 1, 1977;\n(b) every person who\n(i) on July 1, 1977 was not a pensioner but had attained twenty-five years of age and resided in Canada or, if that person did not reside in Canada, had resided in Canada for any period after attaining eighteen years of age or possessed a valid immigration visa,\n(ii) has attained sixty-five years of age, and\n(iii) has resided in Canada for the ten years immediately preceding the day on which that person's application is approved or, if that person has not so resided, has, after attaining eighteen years of age, been present in Canada prior to those ten years for an aggregate period at least equal to three times the aggregate periods of absence from Canada during those ten years, and has resided in Canada for at least one year immediately preceding the day on which that person's application is approved; and\n(c) every person who\n(i) was not a pensioner on July 1, 1977,\n(ii) has attained sixty-five years of age, and\n(iii) has resided in Canada after attaining eighteen years of age and prior to the day on which that person's application is approved for an aggregate period of at least forty years.\n(2) Subject to this Act and the regulations, a partial monthly pension may be paid for any month in a payment quarter to every person who is not eligible for a full monthly pension under subsection (1) and\n(a) has

least ten years but less than forty years and, where that aggregate period is less than twenty years, was resident in Canada on the day preceding the day on which that person's application is approved.\n(3) The amount of a partial monthly pension, for any month, shall bear the same relation to the full monthly pension for that month as the aggregate period that the applicant has resided in Canada after attaining eighteen years of age and prior to the day on which the application is approved, determined in accordance with subsection (4), bears to forty years.\n(4) For the purpose of calculating the amount of a partial monthly pension under subsection (3), the aggregate period described in that subsection shall be rounded to the lower multiple of a year when it is not a multiple

if not, was legally resident in Canada.\n(2) The Governor in Council may make regulations respecting the meaning of legal residence for the purposes of subsection (1).\n. . . . .\n40(1) Where, under any law of a country other than Canada, provision is made for the payment of old age or other benefits including survivors' or disability benefits, the Minister may, on behalf of the Government of Canada, on such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Governor in Council, enter into an agreement with the government of that country for the making of reciprocal arrangements relating to the administration or operation of that law and of this Act, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, arrangements relating to\n(a) the exchange of such information obtained under that law or this Act as may be necessary to give effect to any such arrangements;\n(b) the administration of benefits payable under this Act to persons resident in that country, the extension of benefits under that law or this Act to persons employed in or resident in that country and the increase or decrease in the amount of the benefits payable under that law or this Act to persons employed

resident in Canada and the increase or decrease in the amount of the benefits payable under that law or this Act to persons employed in or resident in Canada;\n(d) the totalization of periods of residence and periods of contribution in that country and periods of residence in Canada; and\n(e) the payment by that country and Canada respectively, where applicable as a result of totalization, of prorated benefits based on periods of residence and periods of contribution in that country and periods of residence in Canada.\n(2) For the purpose of giving effect to any agreement entered into under subsection (1), the Governor in Council may make such regulations respecting the manner in which this Act shall apply to any case or class of cases affected by the agreement, and for adapting this Act thereto, as appear to the Governor in Council to be necessary for that purpose, and any regulations so made may provide therein for the making of any financial adjustments required under the agreement and for the crediting or charging of the amount of any such adjustments to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n. . . . .\n41(1) The Governor in Council may, by order, declare any agreement entered into under section 40 to be in force and, when any such order comes into force, the agreement to which it relates has the force of law in Canada during such period as by the terms of the agreement it remains in force.\nOld Age Security Regulations\n21(1) For the purposes of the Act and these Regulations,\n(a) a person resides in Canada if he makes his home and ordinarily lives in any

outside Canada of the spouse after their marriage or of the common-law partner after becoming such a partner is considered a period of residence and presence in Canada, if\n(a) the spouse or common-law partner returns to Canada either before or within six months after the return of the person residing in Canada or within six months after that person's death if that person dies while so absent from Canada; or\n(b) the spouse or common-law partner attains, during that period outside Canada, an age at which the spouse or common-law partner is eligible to be paid a pension under the

        "The Review Tribunal correctly applied s. 21(5.3) of the Regulations, excluding periods of participation in the German pension plan from OAS calculation.",
        "Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement applies, stating periods of residence in Canada while subject to German pension coverage are not considered residence in Canada.",

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether Mr. Stachowski’s time abroad between 1968 and 1991 could be considered ‘residence’ for OAS pension purposes, specifically relying on s. 21(3) of the Old Age Security Regulations. The court found the Review Tribunal erred by failing to consider s. 21(3) and instead focused on s. 21(5), which was inapplicable to Mr. Stachowski’s situation.",
      "The court emphasized the importance of statutory interpretation, applying the principle that statutes must be read in their entire context, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act and Parliament’s intention. It noted the Review Tribunal’s misinterpretation stemmed from focusing on the wrong provision and, consequently, directing its mind to the wrong question.",
      "Regarding the impact of Mr. Stachowski’s contributions to the German pension scheme, the court upheld the Review Tribunal’s decision that these contributions precluded counting the period from 1968 to 1988 as Canadian residency. This conclusion was based on the interplay of s. 40 and 41 of the Old Age Security Act, the Canada/Germany Agreement (specifically Article 11(b)), and s. 21(5.3) of the Regulations.",
      "The court reasoned that Article 11(b) of the Canada/Germany Agreement, which states periods of residence in Canada while subject to German mandatory pension coverage are not considered Canadian residency, has the force of law in Canada.  S. 21(5.3) of the Regulations reinforces this by deeming individuals subject to foreign pension schemes as not resident in Canada.",
      "The court rejected Mr. Stachowski’s argument that s. 21(5.3) only applied if benefits were not otherwise qualified for, finding that it applied regardless of whether residency was established through other provisions like s. 21(3). The court emphasized the purpose of the agreement was to avoid double benefits and ensure fairness.",
      "The court clarified that the legislative scheme, including the Act, Regulations, and the Canada/Germany Agreement, must be read harmoniously to prevent duplicate benefits and ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by having periods of contribution in multiple countries. The court found that applying s. 21(3) and disregarding s. 21(5.3) would undermine this objective."

    "final_outcome": [
      "The Decision of the Review Tribunal regarding s. 21(5)(c) of the Regulations was quashed.",
      "The matter was remitted to a differently constituted panel of the Review Tribunal for reconsideration.",
      "The application for judicial review was dismissed with respect to the other matters before the Review Tribunal.",
      "There was no order as to costs."
