    "[0]\nI.\nPreliminary",
    "[1]\nShore, J.\n[Translation]: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it ...\": Elie Wiesel (Nobel Peace Prize, 1986).",
    "[2]\nA court can only determine what has\nalready\nhappened, as a testament to the history that is recorded by evidence, once it has been determined, as a fait accompli, creating simply another precedent.",
    "[3]\nIn this case, the applicant, a lawyer, should have known the consequences for himself when he joined an organization known for its actions and its history, and thus its present and future consequences.",
    "[4]\nThe Court is in complete agreement with the position so eruditely argued by counsel for the respondent, Normand Lemyre, that excluding the applicant is not unreasonable because the exclusion is not vitiated by any reviewable error of law.\nII.\nIntroduction",
    "[5]\nThis is an application under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection\nAct\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (\nIRPA\n) for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated June 4, 2010, in which the applicant's refugee protection claim was rejected because there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed crimes against humanity.\nIII.\nFacts",
    "[6]\nThe applicant, Ambroise Mapangu Ishaku, is 50 years old and a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He arrived in Canada at the Lacolle, Quebec, port of entry on January 2, 2008, and claimed refugee protection in Canada on that date, under section 96 and paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the\nIRPA\n. He was carrying a Congolese passport and had spent 16 days in New York, in the United States, to attend a conference of the International Criminal Bar.",
    "[7]\nThe applicant has 17 years of education and is a member of the bar of Kinshasa-Gomba in the DRC.",
    "[8]\nThe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness intervened in this case to seek to have the applicant excluded by virtue of sections 96 and 97, under section 98 of the\nIRPA\n, because in the Minister's opinion the applicant is a person referred to in paragraphs 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n(\nConvention\n). In the Minister's opinion, there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant has committed crimes against humanity and is guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.",
    "[9]\nThe applicant claims to fear for his life because of his political activities as a member of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a political/military movement founded in 1998 and supported by Uganda, armed by Libya and led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. By his own admission, the aim of the movement was to overthrow the dictatorial government of the DRC by political methods and armed struggle (Decision of the RPD at paras. 2 and 9).",
    "[10]\nThe applicant's problems allegedly began in late 2006 and culminated in his detention in 2007. The applicant was then supposedly released under pressure from the bar and managed to flee the DRC and go to the United States, where he was to attend a meeting of the International Criminal Bar. As noted earlier, the applicant entered Canada on January 2, 2008, and claimed refugee protection that day (Decision of the RPD at para. 2).",
    "[11]\nThe RPD agreed with the parties that it would first decide the issue of the exclusion of the applicant and, in the event that it did not exclude him, the parties would be reconvened for a hearing concerning inclusion, that is, his alleged fear of persecution (Decision of the RPD at para. 5).",
    "[12]\nOn June 4, 2010, the RPD concluded that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant \"was complicit in crimes against humanity\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 54).",
    "[13]\nAccordingly, on that date, the RPD determined that the applicant is excluded from the application of the\nConvention\nunder paragraph 1F(a) and therefore could not be granted the protection of Canada, as provided by section 98 of the\nIRPA\n(Decision of the RPD at para. 58).",
    "[14]\nIt is that decision that the applicant is contesting in this proceeding.\nIV.\nIssue",
    "[15]\nIs the exclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a) of the\nConvention\nreasonable, having regard to the evidence and the applicable law?\nV.\nAnalysis",
    "[16]\nIn the opinion of the Court, the decision is entirely justified in its context. The Court is entirely in agreement with the respondent's position.\nApplicable standards of review",
    "[17]\nThe purely factual findings on which the RPD based its reasoning in making its determination are subject to the reasonableness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2009 FC 567, at para. 14;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 44).",
    "[18] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[19]\nThe question of whether the evidence discloses serious reasons for considering that the applicant is a person described in paragraph 1F(a) is subject to the reasonableness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2010 FC 1, at para. 27;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 384 N.R. 293; 2008 FCA 404).",
    "[20]\nIf the impugned decision has qualities that make it reasonable, that are concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, it is reasonable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47).",
    "[21]\nThe issue in that regard is therefore whether there was evidence on which the RPD's conclusion that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant is a person referred to in paragraph 1F(a) could\nreasonably\nbe based. It is important to note that this Court does not perform the same functions as the RPD. The role of this Court is not to decide whether, based on the evidence submitted to the RPD, there were \"serious reasons for considering\"; it is solely to decide\nwhether it was unreasonable\nfor the RPD to reach that conclusion (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 32-33;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2010 FC 781, at para. 29;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 49; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).\nApplicable provisions relating to grounds for exclusion",
    "[22]\nSection 98 of the\nIRPA\nreads as follows:\n\"98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\"",
    "[23]\nUnder subsection 2(1) of the\nIRPA\n, the expression \"\nRefugee Convention\n\" means the above-mentioned\nConvention\n.",
    "[24]\nThe relevant parts of section F of article 1 of the\nConvention\nread as follows:\n\"F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; ...\"",
    "[25]\nThe RPD concluded that it had serious reasons for considering that the applicant had committed crimes against humanity.",
    "[26]\nContrary to the applicant's submission, when an exclusion clause applies, the RPD need not rule as to inclusion, in particular by reason of section 98 of the\nIRPA\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 38;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 388 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1017 (F.C.A.)).\nStandard of proof",
    "[27]\nThe applicable standard of proof is set out in section 1F of the\nConvention\n, under which the provisions of the\nConvention\ndo not apply to persons with respect to whom there are\nserious reasons for considering\nthat they have committed, inter alia, a crime against humanity as defined above.",
    "[28]\nAn \"exclusion\" hearing under section 1F is not of the same nature as a criminal trial, at which the Minister must prove guilt or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the Minister has the burden of proving, having regard to the evidence presented to the Board, that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that the applicant has committed a crime set out in paragraph 1F(a) or 1F(b) or has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (1F(c)) (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 132 (F.C.A.)).",
    "[29]\nIn general, the RPD must assess and weigh the evidence that it has found to be credible or trustworthy in the case and decide whether the minimum test of \"serious reasons for considering\" that the alleged crime(s) or act(s) were committed has been met. The standard of proof that must be used in applying the minimum test requires something more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities. In essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information (\nLai\n, above, at para. 25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 114;\nCharkaoui, Re\n, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350; 358 N.R. 1; 2007 SCC 9, at para. 39).",
    "[30]\nThat standard applies to decisions as to the facts. The issue of whether the act or omission in question constitutes a crime referred to in paragraph 1F(a) is a question of law (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 26).\nExclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a\n)\nWhat is a \"crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes\"\n?",
    "[31]\nParagraph 1F(a) must be interpreted so as to include international instruments concluded since it was adopted in 1951, such that in applying that provision, regard must also be had to the definition of a crime against humanity set out in the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court\n, adopted on July 17, 1998, and in effect on July 1, 2002 (\nHarb\n, above, at para. 8).",
    "[32]\nArticle 7 of the\nRome Statute\nis important in applying paragraph 1F(a), since it contains a contemporaneous definition of crimes against humanity. The Statute is in fact the first multilateral international instrument of general application that provides a detailed definition of the list of acts characterized as crimes against humanity that were formerly recognized by various international instruments (\nHarb\n, above, at para. 7; Lison Néel, \"La judiciarisation internationale des criminels de guerre: la solution aux violations graves du droit international humanitaire?\" (2000), 33(2) Criminologie 151 at p. 166).",
    "[33]\nThe relevant parts of paragraph 7(1) of the\nRome Statute\nread as follows:\n\"... 'crime against humanity' means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:\n(a) Murder;\n(b) Extermination;\n(c) Enslavement;\n(d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population;\n(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;\n(f) Torture;\n(g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity;\n(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;\n(i) Enforced disappearance of persons;\n(j) The crime of apartheid;\n(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\"",
    "[34]\nParagraph 7(2) of the\nStatute\nprovides:\n\"2. For the purpose of paragraph 1:\n(a) 'Attack directed against any civilian population' means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack;\n. . . . .\n(c) 'Enslavement' means the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children;\n(d) 'Deportation or forcible transfer of population' means forced displacement of the persons concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law;\n. . . . .\n(g) 'Persecution' means the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity;\n. . . . .\n(i) 'Enforced disappearance of persons' means the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.\"\nCrimes against humanity committed by the MLC during the relevant period\nTime period considered",
    "[35]\nThe RPD examined the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC from June 1999 to the end of 2003, when the movement became a political party, properly speaking.\nSources of information",
    "[36]\nThe RPD relied on a very large number of excerpts from reports prepared by international organizations that monitor the human rights situation in the world, for example: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights, the United Nations Economic and Social Council and Security Council, Reporters Without Borders and the United States Country Reports on Human Rights. These are reliable sources.",
    "[37]\nContrary to the applicant's submission, the RPD referred in its reasons concerning the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC at the relevant time to a number of specific documents from the above-mentioned sources of information (on this point, see footnotes 5 to 14, inclusive, and 29 to 35, inclusive, of the panel's reasons).\nCrimes in issue",
    "[38]\nAccording to extensive and overwhelming documentary evidence, members of the MLC committed murders of civilians, rape against women, girls and boys, arrests and arbitrary detentions, kidnappings, disappearances and arbitrary killings of civilians, torture, abduction for the purpose of forced labour, massacres, fires and pillaging of homes abandoned by fleeing populations with entire villages destroyed from top to bottom, forcible transfers of populations (over 10,000 people), genocide and ethnic cleansing, in the DRC and Central Africa, as premeditated tools of warfare. According to the evidence, all of these horrors were committed on a large scale, and thousands and thousands of innocent victims were targeted.",
    "[39]\nThe evidence also reports incidents of cannibalism by soldiers of the Armée de Libération du Congo (ALC (army for the liberation of Congo)), the armed branch of the MLC, with the knowledge of MLC leaders. The evidence further reports that the ALC recruited thousands of child soldiers and that in certain areas they constituted up to 40% of the armed forces. These children were subjected to unimaginable horrors, forced to fight and often to kill their own families, forced to engage in cannibalism, raped and used as sex slaves. It is important to point out that the ALC is an integral part of the MLC, which is clearly stated in the MLC's statutes.\nCrimes against humanity",
    "[40]\nHaving regard to that evidence, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the MLC had, from 1999 to 2003, systematically engaged in a very large number of barbarous and inhumane acts and severe persecution, and that the persecution was widespread and systematic against the civilian population and the groups targeted.",
    "[41]\nThese crimes, committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population and with knowledge of the attack, pursuant to or in furtherance of an organizational policy to commit such attack, are crimes against humanity as set out in the following subparagraphs of the\nRome Statute\n: 7(1)(a) (murder), 7(1)(c) and 7(2)(c) (enslavement), 7(1)(d) and 7(2)(d) (forcible transfer of population), 7(1)(e) (imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law), 7(1)(f) and 7(2)(e) (torture), 7(1)(g) (rape, sexual slavery), 7(1)(h) and 7(2)(g) (persecution), 7(1)(i) (enforced disappearance of persons) and 7(1)(k) (other inhumane acts of a similar character) of the\nRome Statute\n.",
    "[42]\nThe abuses committed by the MLC in Central Africa in 2002-2003 were denounced by the Central African Republic, which submitted the case to the International Criminal Court in 2006. In 2007, an international arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity was issued against the leader of the MLC, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was arrested in Brussels that year. In January 2009, his trial was in progress.",
    "[43]\nIn the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the MLC committed crimes against humanity during the relevant period.\nComplicity of the applicant by association",
    "[44]\nThe RPD considered whether there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity, either as an actor or as an accomplice, given that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the applicant himself committed the acts referred to in the documentary evidence.",
    "[45]\nThe RPD therefore focused its analysis on the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC at the relevant time, to determine whether they could support an inference of complicity on the part of the applicant.\nPeriod of time during which the applicant was a member of the MLC",
    "[46]\nDuring his testimony at the hearing, the applicant denied that he was member of the MLC during the period that this movement committed the crimes mentioned. At the beginning of his testimony at the hearing, he alleged that he only joined the MLC in 2004 and that before that date, in 2002, he had briefly been a member of a welcoming committee whose goal was to welcome the MLC if it ever arrived in Kinshasa. He explained that as an elite intellectual, he wanted to ensure that he enjoyed certain benefits as soon as the MLC arrived, such as obtaining prestigious government positions, for example, adviser to a minister. He also claimed that after a few months, this welcoming committee had ceased to exist. The applicant alleged that he was not involved in any political activities until August 2004, when he officially joined the MLC.",
    "[47]\nIn the form he completed when he claimed refugee protection, the applicant indicated, however, that he became a member of the MLC's legal college in May 2000; he did not indicate that he had ceased being a member. Confronted with these major contradictions, the applicant first corrected his testimony and stated that he did indeed join the welcoming committee in 2000, and not in 2002. As for the contradiction between a (Translation) \"welcoming committee\" and a (Translation) \"legal college\", the applicant explained that these terms refer to the same organization.",
    "[48]\nAs for why he did not indicate in his form at the port of entry that he had ceased being a member of the \"welcoming committee / legal college\" in 2000 and that he did not join the MLC itself until 2004, but rather indicated that he had been a member of the MLC since 2000 without interruption, the applicant testified that it is in his nature to explain everything and that there was not enough space in the form to write down every detail.",
    "[49]\nThe evidence contains another key statement from the applicant: he was summoned for an expedited interview on January 8, 2009. During the interview, which was recorded, the RPD officer explained to the applicant that his membership in the MLC could be problematic, given the human rights violations committed by that movement. After this clearly worded warning, the applicant stated that he was indeed a member of the MLC; when asked since when, he stated that he had been (Translation) \"a contributing member since 2000\". On that statement, the expedited interview ended (Tribunal Record (TR), at pp. 75-76, 1090-1108, 1115-1116).",
    "[50]\nAt the hearing before the RPD, the applicant was confronted with the statements he made at the expedited interview. He then changed his account and indicated that he had meant to say welcoming committee when he said MLC. He was going to explain himself at the end of the interview, but found himself in the situation of being unable to explain.",
    "[51]\nWhen asked at the hearing for his definition of \"contributing member,\" the expression that he had used at the expedited interview, the applicant testified that he was talking about the welcoming committee.",
    "[52]\nAt the hearing in March 2010, the applicant tried to change testimony that he subsequently realized was highly incriminating, given the Minister's intervention submitted in March 2009. It can reasonably be considered that both at the port of entry in January 2008 and at his expedited interview in January 2009 he\nspontaneously\ntold the truth about his membership in the MLC.",
    "[53]\nA person's first story is usually the most genuine and, therefore, the one to be most believed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 21;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 14).",
    "[54]\nThere is no reason here to doubt the truth and accuracy of the statements made by the applicant to the immigration officer at the port of entry and before the RPD at the expedited process stage. Moreover, the applicant is an educated man, given that he is a lawyer, and speaks excellent French. It is therefore reasonable to expect him to be able to give the immigration officer and the Board a clear explanation of his reasons for leaving his country. Finally, this is not a case in which the evidence on record shows that real prejudice was caused to a claimant for refugee protection because of flagrant mistakes in interpretation made by an interpreter at the hearing or at the initial interview with the immigration officer ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 15).",
    "[55]\nGiven his level of education and especially his profession, the applicant should have known the importance of the statements he was making to the Canadian immigration authorities, whom he was asking to protect him.",
    "[56]\nAccordingly, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant had been a member of the MLC since 2000 and that he had not ceased to be a member until he left the DRC in 2007.\nThe caselaw on complicity by association",
    "[57]\nAccomplices as well as principal actors may be found to have committed crimes within the meaning of international criminal law: international crimes. The concept of complicity is recognized in the caselaw, defined as personal and knowing participation, and complicity by association, whereby individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close and voluntary association with the principal actors in an organization that commits international crimes.\nComplicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that the individual in question has of the commission of the crimes\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 27, aff'd 2005 FCA 303;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 28).",
    "[58]\nMere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient to bring one into the category of an accomplice. At the same time, where the organization's\nprimary objective\nis achieved by means of crimes against humanity, or it is directed to a limited, brutal purpose, membership will generally be sufficient to establish complicity ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , FC, above, at para. 28;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 23).",
    "[59]\nA person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them from occurring (if he or she has the power to do so) nor disengages himself or herself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself or herself) but who lends his or her active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. That statement is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a\ncontinuous and regular\npart of the operation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , CF, above at para. 28; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 38).",
    "[60]\nAssociation with an organization responsible for international crimes may imply complicity if the person concerned personally or knowingly participated in the crimes, or knowingly tolerated them (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 563 (F.C.A.)).",
    "[61]\nThe mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity has been characterized variously as \"shared common purpose\", \"personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes\", and\nparticipation in an organization knowing it commits crimes against humanity, when combined with a failure to stop the crimes or disassociate oneself\n. (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 24).",
    "[62]\nA person's rank within an organization, among other things, speaks to the likelihood of that person's knowledge and involvement in the organization's bad acts. However, one need not be in a leading position in order to be found complicit. Thus, the person's position in the organization may demonstrate that person's personal and knowing participation, and ultimately the person's complicity in the organization's commission of crimes. The higher the person concerned is in the ranks of the organization, the more likely it is that he or she was aware of the crimes committed and shared the organization's purpose in committing them. Accordingly, a person who remains in a high position in the organization, knowing that it has been responsible for crimes against humanity, may be considered to be complicit (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 15-16;\nThomas\n, above, at paras. 26-48; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 44-45, 58;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 25).\nThe MLC was an organization with a limited, brutal purpose",
    "[63]\nIt is therefore important to determine whether, during the period when the applicant was a member, starting in 2000, the MLC may be described as an organization with a limited, brutal purpose.",
    "[64]\nThe caselaw indicates that an organization whose very existence \"is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means deemed necessary\" creates a presumption that mere membership in the organization implies complicity, without the need to connect the applicant's complicity to a particular crime committed by the organization (\nMoreno and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1048 (F.C.A.), at para. 45).",
    "[65]\nIn this case, from 2000 to the end of 2003, the years when the applicant was a member, the MLC's primary objective was to succeed in having the MLC overthrow the dictatorship of President Kabila and take power. That objective is even set out in the statutes of the movement. In addition, although the applicant was a member of the political branch of the movement and not its armed branch, as a member of the \"legal college\", it is clear that the MLC intended to achieve its objectives primarily through the actions of its armed branch, which was not separate from it. The statutes of the movement, again, are clear on that point, and it is confirmed by the documentary evidence.",
    "[66]\nThe evidence is that all means considered necessary were used by the MLC to achieve its objective, as described earlier: arbitrary arrests, murders, rapes, summary executions, cannibalism, massacres, systematic torture, pillaging, fires, the use of child soldiers, genocide and ethnic cleansing.",
    "[67]\nIn the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to conclude that, beyond a doubt, during the years when the applicant was a member, the MLC continuously and regularly engaged in crimes against humanity to achieve its political objective. This suggests that the MLC was an organization with a limited, brutal purpose ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 12). It should be noted that in that case, membership in such an organization is generally sufficient to establish complicity (\nThomas\n, above, at para. 23).",
    "[68]\nThe RPD could therefore reasonably have presumed that the applicant had the mental element required, the necessary mens rea, for a finding of complicity, and that he was therefore complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC from 2000 to the end of 2003.",
    "[69]\nHowever, that is a rebuttable presumption ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 6;\nThomas\n, above, at para. 24;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 15;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1284 (T.D.)).",
    "[70]\nThe case law has laid down the factors to be taken into consideration in determining whether there genuinely are serious reasons for considering that a claimant may be considered to be complicit in the commission of crimes or acts referred to in section 1F of the\nConvention\n. Those factors are: the method of recruitment, the applicant's position and rank in the organization, the nature of the organization, the applicant's knowledge of the crimes or acts committed, the length of his or her participation in the organization's activities, and the opportunity to leave ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 38-44;\nThomas\n, above, at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 7).",
    "[71]\nIf these factors are applied in this case, they confirm the applicant's complicity.\nNature of the organization",
    "[72]\nAt the relevant time, the MLC was a rebel movement and not a political party.",
    "[73]\nAs noted earlier, according to the abundant evidence cited by the RPD, in the years when the applicant was a member of the MLC it continuously and regularly engaged in crimes against humanity to achieve its political objective.\nMethod of recruitment",
    "[74]\nIt is clear that the applicant joined the MLC voluntarily: in fact, he testified that he wanted to better position himself on the political ladder and become a close government advisor when the MLC toppled President Kabila and assumed power. He also testified, (Translation) \"I espoused their political convictions; I was hoping for a new political era\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 39).\nPosition within the organization",
    "[75]\nThe applicant held a decision-making position, or at the very least an advisory position, as a member of the movement's legal college. He was not a subordinate who did not know the direction his organization was taking. In view of his activism and the positions he took against the government in place, he was counsel to Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was, as noted earlier, the leader of the MLC, in the Supreme Court of Justice of the DRC (TR at p. 181).\nKnowledge of atrocities",
    "[76]\nThe claimant's testimony regarding his knowledge of the atrocities committed by the MLC was not credible.",
    "[77]\nHe initially testified that he did not know any details concerning the armed branch of the MLC. However, the documentary evidence indicates that the violations committed by the ALC were well-known and highly publicized.",
    "[78]\nAfter several questions and confrontations, the claimant finally testified that between 2000 and 2004, he was aware of the human rights violations committed by the MLC (TR at pp. 992-993, 999, 1001, 1005-1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, 1035, 1043-1044, 1046). Concerning the massacres in North-Kivu, the applicant testified that he had been aware of them, but not in detail (TR at p. 994). He said that he heard through media reports that there was a war and, according to him, stray bullets that might hit a civilian are normal, that in a state of war, civilians sometimes died, but he was not aware that civilians were the target of attacks (TR at p. 995). When asked whether he had heard of the systematic rape of women, girls and boys as a weapon of warfare, and the murder of civilians, he claimed that he had not (TR at pp. 995-996, 998), and then admitted that he was in fact aware of that (TR at pp. 1043-1044, 1046) (Decision of the RPD at para. 44).",
    "[79]\nWhen he was asked whether the government talked about the abuses committed by the MLC at that time, he testified that it was difficult to treat these reports as the truth and he put them down to political brainwashing (TR at pp. 998-999, 1001-1002). However, he did not try to verify whether the reports were true because, according to his testimony, he was very busy with his work at a law firm (TR at p. 1003) (Decision of the RPD at para. 45).",
    "[80]\nWhen asked about the fires and massacres of entire villages in April 2001, which were widely reported in the media, the claimant testified that he had heard about the clash between the MLC and the\nmayi-mayi\n; but knew nothing about that exact incident. However, he knew that there had been massacres generally by the MLC (TR at pp. 1010-1011). Later in his testimony the applicant tried to minimize the situation, essentially saying that it depended on the meaning given to the word\nmassacre\n. (Translation) \"When I hear that someone died, am I going to try to find out if it was a massacre?\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 46; TR at pp. 1022-1024).",
    "[81]\nAbout operation \"Effacez le tableau\" (wipe the slate), which was widely reported in the documentary evidence, the applicant knew only that (Translation) \"the MLC killed a group of pygmies and attacked the pygmies\" (TR at p. 1011). However, he added that at first he had believed it, but then he doubted the information because it was beyond human understanding that there was cannibalism in the Congo (TR at pp. 1012-1013). When confronted with the fact that even Bemba, the leader of the MLC, admitted in January 2003 that his movement engaged in cannibalism (TR at p. 596), the applicant answered that it might have happened, but (Translation) \"the population doubts it\" (TR at pp. 1014, 1017).",
    "[82]\nIt was not unreasonable for the RPD not to accept these attempts to offer justification. First, the conduct of the applicant in attempting to minimize the abuses committed by the MLC, while at the same time claiming that he was not a member, was contradictory. In addition, it is implausible that the applicant was not aware of the gravity and the systematic and systemic nature of the crimes committed by the MLC (Decision of the RPD at para. 47).",
    "[83]\nIf, as in this case, an individual lives and works in a country where thousands of people are victims of crimes against humanity and where one hears about it, it is totally unbelievable that one would not have knowledge of what is taking place (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 133 (T.D.) at para. 25).",
    "[84]\nConcerning the mass recruitment of child soldiers, the applicant testified that he was aware of it, but according to him, it was done in 1998-1999 by soldiers of the former Mobutu regime, to supplement its forces (TR at pp. 1036, 1039-1040). When confronted with the fact that this practice continued in 2002, the applicant stated that he was not aware of it (Decision of the RPD at para. 48).",
    "[85]\nAt one point during the hearing, the applicant stopped his denials and admitted that the MLC was an armed movement before 2004 and that he knew it (TR at pp. 1046-1047), and that he knew that even the political branch supported the armed conflict, in accordance with the movement's statutes (Decision of the RPD at para. 49).\nLength of time in the organization",
    "[86]\nAs noted earlier, the RPD did not believe the applicant when he alleged that he did not join the MLC until 2004. Having regard to the evidence described above, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that he was an active member of the MLC starting in 2000 and until the end of 2003, during a period when the movement was continuously and regularly committing the crimes against humanity referred to earlier.\nOpportunity to leave the organization",
    "[87]\nThe applicant voluntarily remained with an organization that he knew was committing or had committed serious human rights violations.",
    "[88]\nThe applicant's testimony when confronted with the atrocities committed by the MLC was nonchalant and completely lacking in empathy for the thousands of victims. He spoke of this period in his country's history as a period of isolated incidents, (Translation) \"pockets of resistance,\" the normal consequences of war. However, the massacres of civilians, the systematic rape of women, girls and boys, and the recruitment of child soldiers are not the collateral damage of a war. The applicant's speech is that of an active member of the MLC who knew what was going on but who, out of political ambition, chose that movement, the only party that, in his opinion, could have removed either of the Kabilas from power. He testified that his goal was to become a close government advisor (TR at p. 1113; Decision of the RPD at para. 52).",
    "[89]\nHaving regard to the foregoing, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant had not rebutted the presumption that he was complicit in crimes against humanity committed by the MLC between 2000 and 2004.\nThe RPD did not have to conclude that a crime against humanity set out in paragraph 1F(a) committed by the MLC was necessarily and directly attributable to the specific acts or omissions of the applicant",
    "[90]\nThe applicant further submits that no crime set out in paragraph 1F(a) is attributable to him personally.",
    "[91]\nIn the case of complicity by association, it is not the nature of the crimes with which the applicant was charged that lead to his exclusion, but that of the crimes alleged against the organization with which he was associated. On that point, the Court of Appeal quoted with approval the following passage from the reasons of the Court in\nHarb\n, above, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\" [11] The first of these arguments does not apply in the case at bar. It is not the nature of the crimes with which the appellant was charged that led to his exclusion, but that of the crimes alleged against the organizations with which he was supposed to be associated. Once those organizations have committed crimes against humanity and the appellant meets the requirements for membership in the group, knowledge, participation or complicity imposed by precedent (see inter alia,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)), the exclusion applies even if the specific acts committed by the appellant himself are not crimes against humanity as such. ...\"",
    "[92]\nIt should also be noted that in exclusion cases the courts have never required, in order for a claimant to be found to be complicit by association, that he or she be connected with specific crimes or acts as the person who actually committed them, or that the crimes or acts committed by an organization be necessarily and directly attributable to specific omissions or acts by the claimant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 31-32; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 3-13;\nB., Re\n, [1997] E.W.J. No. 700 (C.A.), at paras. 7 et seq. (CA England and Wales);\nHarb\n, above, at para. 11; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 55-56).\nVI.\nConclusion",
    "[93]\nIn light of the caselaw and the evidence, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to have serious reasons for considering that the applicant has committed crimes against humanity.",
    "[94]\nIt was therefore not unreasonable for the RPD to exclude the applicant from the application of the\nConvention\nunder paragraph 1F(a).",
    "[95]\nAccordingly, the applicant may not be granted the protection of Canada, as set out in section 98 of the\nIRPA\n.",
    "[96]\nThe applicant had knowledge of the crimes committed by the MLC at the relevant time and he shared the criminal intentions of that organization.",
    "[97]\nThe applicant's entirely voluntary association with the MLC for three years, in the knowledge of the crimes committed by that organization, shows that he adhered to the purposes and practices of that movement, and this makes him complicit in those crimes.",
    "[98]\nAs noted earlier, citing lengthy caselaw, when an applicant is aware that the group to which he or she belongs is continuously and regularly committing crimes or acts referred to in section F of Article 1 of the\nConvention\nand does not try to disengage himself or herself from that group at the earliest opportunity, consistent with safety for himself or herself, the RPD may then reasonably conclude that the applicant cannot have status as a refugee or person in need of protection under section 98 of the\nIRPA\n.",
    "[99]\nIt is plain, moreover, that the crimes committed by the MLC at the relevant time, as found by the RPD, were crimes against humanity within the meaning of paragraph 1F(a).",
    "[100]\nAccordingly, based on the evidence and the applicable law, the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity, merely by reason of his close and voluntary association with the MLC, since he knowingly tolerated them and did not leave the movement at the earliest opportunity.",
    "[101]\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the exclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a) is not unreasonable and is not vitiated by any reviewable error of law.",
    "[102]\nFor all of the reasons set out above, the applicant's application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[103]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n1. the applicant's application for judicial review be dismissed;\n2. no serious question of general importance be certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Sharon McCartney/vnh"

  "full_text": "I.\nPreliminary\n[1]\nShore, J.\n[Translation]: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it ...\": Elie Wiesel (Nobel Peace Prize, 1986).\n[2]\nA court can only determine what has\nalready\nhappened, as a testament to the history that is recorded by evidence, once it has been determined, as a fait accompli, creating simply another precedent.\n[3]\nIn this case, the applicant, a lawyer, should have known the consequences for himself when he joined an organization known for its actions and its history, and thus its present and future consequences.\n[4]\nThe Court is in complete agreement with the position so eruditely argued by counsel for the respondent, Normand Lemyre, that excluding the applicant is not unreasonable because the exclusion is not vitiated by any reviewable error of law.\nII.\nIntroduction\n[5]\nThis is an application under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection\nAct\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (\nIRPA\n) for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated June 4, 2010, in which the applicant's refugee protection claim was rejected because there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed crimes against humanity.\nIII.\nFacts\n[6]\nThe applicant, Ambroise Mapangu Ishaku, is 50 years old and a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He arrived in Canada at the Lacolle, Quebec, port of entry on January 2, 2008, and claimed refugee protection in Canada on that date, under section 96 and paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the\nIRPA\n. He was carrying a Congolese passport and had spent 16 days in New York, in the United States, to attend a conference of the International Criminal Bar.\n[7]\nThe applicant has 17 years of education and is a member of the bar of Kinshasa-Gomba in the DRC.\n[8]\nThe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness intervened in this case to seek to have the applicant excluded by virtue of sections 96 and 97, under section 98 of the\nIRPA\n, because in the Minister's opinion the applicant is a person referred to in paragraphs 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n(\nConvention\n). In the Minister's opinion, there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant has committed crimes against humanity and is guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n[9]\nThe applicant claims to fear for his life because of his political activities as a member of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a political/military movement founded in 1998 and supported by Uganda, armed by Libya and led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. By his own admission, the aim of the movement was to overthrow the dictatorial government of the DRC by political methods and armed struggle (Decision of the RPD at paras. 2 and 9).\n[10]\nThe applicant's problems allegedly began in late 2006 and culminated in his detention in 2007. The applicant was then supposedly released under pressure from the bar and managed to flee the DRC and go to the United States, where he was to attend a meeting of the International Criminal Bar. As noted earlier, the applicant entered Canada on January 2, 2008, and claimed refugee protection that day (Decision of the RPD at para. 2).\n[11]\nThe RPD agreed with the parties that it would first decide the issue of the exclusion of the applicant and, in the event that it did not exclude him, the parties would be reconvened for a hearing concerning inclusion, that is, his alleged fear of persecution (Decision of the RPD at para. 5).\n[12]\nOn June 4, 2010, the RPD concluded that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant \"was complicit in crimes against humanity\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 54).\n[13]\nAccordingly, on that date, the RPD determined that the applicant is excluded from the application of the\nConvention\nunder paragraph 1F(a) and therefore could not be granted the protection of Canada, as provided by section 98 of the\nIRPA\n(Decision of the RPD at para. 58).\n[14]\nIt is that decision that the applicant is contesting in this proceeding.\nIV.\nIssue\n[15]\nIs the exclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a) of the\nConvention\nreasonable, having regard to the evidence and the applicable law?\nV.\nAnalysis\n[16]\nIn the opinion of the Court, the decision is entirely justified in its context. The Court is entirely in agreement with the respondent's position.\nApplicable standards of review\n[17]\nThe purely factual findings on which the RPD based its reasoning in making its determination are subject to the reasonableness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2009 FC 567, at para. 14;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 44).\n[19]\nThe question of whether the evidence discloses serious reasons for considering that the applicant is a person described in paragraph 1F(a) is subject to the reasonableness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2010 FC 1, at para. 27;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 384 N.R. 293; 2008 FCA 404).\n[20]\nIf the impugned decision has qualities that make it reasonable, that are concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, it is reasonable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47).\n[21]\nThe issue in that regard is therefore whether there was evidence on which the RPD's conclusion that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant is a person referred to in paragraph 1F(a) could\nreasonably\nbe based. It is important to note that this Court does not perform the same functions as the RPD. The role of this Court is not to decide whether, based on the evidence submitted to the RPD, there were \"serious reasons for considering\"; it is solely to decide\nwhether it was unreasonable\nfor the RPD to reach that conclusion (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 32-33;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2010 FC 781, at para. 29;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 49; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).\nApplicable provisions relating to grounds for exclusion\n[22]\nSection 98 of the\nIRPA\nreads as follows:\n\"98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\"\n[23]\nUnder subsection 2(1) of the\nIRPA\n, the expression \"\nRefugee Convention\n\" means the above-mentioned\nConvention\n.\n[24]\nThe relevant parts of section F of article 1 of the\nConvention\nread as follows:\n\"F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; ...\"\n[25]\nThe RPD concluded that it had serious reasons for considering that the applicant had committed crimes against humanity.\n[26]\nContrary to the applicant's submission, when an exclusion clause applies, the RPD need not rule as to inclusion, in particular by reason of section 98 of the\nIRPA\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 38;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 388 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1017 (F.C.A.)).\nStandard of proof\n[27]\nThe applicable standard of proof is set out in section 1F of the\nConvention\n, under which the provisions of the\nConvention\ndo not apply to persons with respect to whom there are\nserious reasons for considering\nthat they have committed, inter alia, a crime against humanity as defined above.\n[28]\nAn \"exclusion\" hearing under section 1F is not of the same nature as a criminal trial, at which the Minister must prove guilt or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the Minister has the burden of proving, having regard to the evidence presented to the Board, that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that the applicant has committed a crime set out in paragraph 1F(a) or 1F(b) or has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (1F(c)) (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 132 (F.C.A.)).\n[29]\nIn general, the RPD must assess and weigh the evidence that it has found to be credible or trustworthy in the case and decide whether the minimum test of \"serious reasons for considering\" that the alleged crime(s) or act(s) were committed has been met. The standard of proof that must be used in applying the minimum test requires something more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities. In essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information (\nLai\n, above, at para. 25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 114;\nCharkaoui, Re\n, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350; 358 N.R. 1; 2007 SCC 9, at para. 39).\n[30]\nThat standard applies to decisions as to the facts. The issue of whether the act or omission in question constitutes a crime referred to in paragraph 1F(a) is a question of law (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 26).\nExclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a\n)\nWhat is a \"crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes\"\n?\n[31]\nParagraph 1F(a) must be interpreted so as to include international instruments concluded since it was adopted in 1951, such that in applying that provision, regard must also be had to the definition of a crime against humanity set out in the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court\n, adopted on July 17, 1998, and in effect on July 1, 2002 (\nHarb\n, above, at para. 8).\n[32]\nArticle 7 of the\nRome Statute\nis important in applying paragraph 1F(a), since it contains a contemporaneous definition of crimes against humanity. The Statute is in fact the first multilateral international instrument of general application that provides a detailed definition of the list of acts characterized as crimes against humanity that were formerly recognized by various international instruments (\nHarb\n, above, at para. 7; Lison Néel, \"La judiciarisation internationale des criminels de guerre: la solution aux violations graves du droit international humanitaire?\" (2000), 33(2) Criminologie 151 at p. 166).\n[33]\nThe relevant parts of paragraph 7(1) of the\nRome Statute\nread as follows:\n\"... 'crime against humanity' means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:\n(a) Murder;\n(b) Extermination;\n(c) Enslavement;\n(d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population;\n(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;\n(f) Torture;\n(g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity;\n(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;\n(i) Enforced disappearance of persons;\n(j) The crime of apartheid;\n(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\"\n[34]\nParagraph 7(2) of the\nStatute\nprovides:\n\"2. For the purpose of paragraph 1:\n(a) 'Attack directed against any civilian population' means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack;\n. . . . .\n(c) 'Enslavement' means the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children;\n(d) 'Deportation or forcible transfer of population' means forced displacement of the persons concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law;\n. . . . .\n(g) 'Persecution' means the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity;\n. . . . .\n(i) 'Enforced disappearance of persons' means the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.\"\nCrimes against humanity committed by the MLC during the relevant period\nTime period considered\n[35]\nThe RPD examined the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC from June 1999 to the end of 2003, when the movement became a political party, properly speaking.\nSources of information\n[36]\nThe RPD relied on a very large number of excerpts from reports prepared by international organizations that monitor the human rights situation in the world, for example: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights, the United Nations Economic and Social Council and Security Council, Reporters Without Borders and the United States Country Reports on Human Rights. These are reliable sources.\n[37]\nContrary to the applicant's submission, the RPD referred in its reasons concerning the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC at the relevant time to a number of specific documents from the above-mentioned sources of information (on this point, see footnotes 5 to 14, inclusive, and 29 to 35, inclusive, of the panel's reasons).\nCrimes in issue\n[38]\nAccording to extensive and overwhelming documentary evidence, members of the MLC committed murders of civilians, rape against women, girls and boys, arrests and arbitrary detentions, kidnappings, disappearances and arbitrary killings of civilians, torture, abduction for the purpose of forced labour, massacres, fires and pillaging of homes abandoned by fleeing populations with entire villages destroyed from top to bottom, forcible transfers of populations (over 10,000 people), genocide and ethnic cleansing, in the DRC and Central Africa, as premeditated tools of warfare. According to the evidence, all of these horrors were committed on a large scale, and thousands and thousands of innocent victims were targeted.\n[39]\nThe evidence also reports incidents of cannibalism by soldiers of the Armée de Libération du Congo (ALC (army for the liberation of Congo)), the armed branch of the MLC, with the knowledge of MLC leaders. The evidence further reports that the ALC recruited thousands of child soldiers and that in certain areas they constituted up to 40% of the armed forces. These children were subjected to unimaginable horrors, forced to fight and often to kill their own families, forced to engage in cannibalism, raped and used as sex slaves. It is important to point out that the ALC is an integral part of the MLC, which is clearly stated in the MLC's statutes.\nCrimes against humanity\n[40]\nHaving regard to that evidence, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the MLC had, from 1999 to 2003, systematically engaged in a very large number of barbarous and inhumane acts and severe persecution, and that the persecution was widespread and systematic against the civilian population and the groups targeted.\n[41]\nThese crimes, committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population and with knowledge of the attack, pursuant to or in furtherance of an organizational policy to commit such attack, are crimes against humanity as set out in the following subparagraphs of the\nRome Statute\n: 7(1)(a) (murder), 7(1)(c) and 7(2)(c) (enslavement), 7(1)(d) and 7(2)(d) (forcible transfer of population), 7(1)(e) (imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law), 7(1)(f) and 7(2)(e) (torture), 7(1)(g) (rape, sexual slavery), 7(1)(h) and 7(2)(g) (persecution), 7(1)(i) (enforced disappearance of persons) and 7(1)(k) (other inhumane acts of a similar character) of the\nRome Statute\n.\n[42]\nThe abuses committed by the MLC in Central Africa in 2002-2003 were denounced by the Central African Republic, which submitted the case to the International Criminal Court in 2006. In 2007, an international arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity was issued against the leader of the MLC, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was arrested in Brussels that year. In January 2009, his trial was in progress.\n[43]\nIn the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the MLC committed crimes against humanity during the relevant period.\nComplicity of the applicant by association\n[44]\nThe RPD considered whether there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity, either as an actor or as an accomplice, given that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the applicant himself committed the acts referred to in the documentary evidence.\n[45]\nThe RPD therefore focused its analysis on the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC at the relevant time, to determine whether they could support an inference of complicity on the part of the applicant.\nPeriod of time during which the applicant was a member of the MLC\n[46]\nDuring his testimony at the hearing, the applicant denied that he was member of the MLC during the period that this movement committed the crimes mentioned. At the beginning of his testimony at the hearing, he alleged that he only joined the MLC in 2004 and that before that date, in 2002, he had briefly been a member of a welcoming committee whose goal was to welcome the MLC if it ever arrived in Kinshasa. He explained that as an elite intellectual, he wanted to ensure that he enjoyed certain benefits as soon as the MLC arrived, such as obtaining prestigious government positions, for example, adviser to a minister. He also claimed that after a few months, this welcoming committee had ceased to exist. The applicant alleged that he was not involved in any political activities until August 2004, when he officially joined the MLC.\n[47]\nIn the form he completed when he claimed refugee protection, the applicant indicated, however, that he became a member of the MLC's legal college in May 2000; he did not indicate that he had ceased being a member. Confronted with these major contradictions, the applicant first corrected his testimony and stated that he did indeed join the welcoming committee in 2000, and not in 2002. As for the contradiction between a (Translation) \"welcoming committee\" and a (Translation) \"legal college\", the applicant explained that these terms refer to the same organization.\n[48]\nAs for why he did not indicate in his form at the port of entry that he had ceased being a member of the \"welcoming committee / legal college\" in 2000 and that he did not join the MLC itself until 2004, but rather indicated that he had been a member of the MLC since 2000 without interruption, the applicant testified that it is in his nature to explain everything and that there was not enough space in the form to write down every detail.\n[49]\nThe evidence contains another key statement from the applicant: he was summoned for an expedited interview on January 8, 2009. During the interview, which was recorded, the RPD officer explained to the applicant that his membership in the MLC could be problematic, given the human rights violations committed by that movement. After this clearly worded warning, the applicant stated that he was indeed a member of the MLC; when asked since when, he stated that he had been (Translation) \"a contributing member since 2000\". On that statement, the expedited interview ended (Tribunal Record (TR), at pp. 75-76, 1090-1108, 1115-1116).\n[50]\nAt the hearing before the RPD, the applicant was confronted with the statements he made at the expedited interview. He then changed his account and indicated that he had meant to say welcoming committee when he said MLC. He was going to explain himself at the end of the interview, but found himself in the situation of being unable to explain.\n[51]\nWhen asked at the hearing for his definition of \"contributing member,\" the expression that he had used at the expedited interview, the applicant testified that he was talking about the welcoming committee.\n[52]\nAt the hearing in March 2010, the applicant tried to change testimony that he subsequently realized was highly incriminating, given the Minister's intervention submitted in March 2009. It can reasonably be considered that both at the port of entry in January 2008 and at his expedited interview in January 2009 he\nspontaneously\ntold the truth about his membership in the MLC.\n[53]\nA person's first story is usually the most genuine and, therefore, the one to be most believed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 21;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 14).\n[54]\nThere is no reason here to doubt the truth and accuracy of the statements made by the applicant to the immigration officer at the port of entry and before the RPD at the expedited process stage. Moreover, the applicant is an educated man, given that he is a lawyer, and speaks excellent French. It is therefore reasonable to expect him to be able to give the immigration officer and the Board a clear explanation of his reasons for leaving his country. Finally, this is not a case in which the evidence on record shows that real prejudice was caused to a claimant for refugee protection because of flagrant mistakes in interpretation made by an interpreter at the hearing or at the initial interview with the immigration officer ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 15).\n[55]\nGiven his level of education and especially his profession, the applicant should have known the importance of the statements he was making to the Canadian immigration authorities, whom he was asking to protect him.\n[56]\nAccordingly, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant had been a member of the MLC since 2000 and that he had not ceased to be a member until he left the DRC in 2007.\nThe caselaw on complicity by association\n[57]\nAccomplices as well as principal actors may be found to have committed crimes within the meaning of international criminal law: international crimes. The concept of complicity is recognized in the caselaw, defined as personal and knowing participation, and complicity by association, whereby individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close and voluntary association with the principal actors in an organization that commits international crimes.\nComplicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that the individual in question has of the commission of the crimes\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 27, aff'd 2005 FCA 303;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 28).\n[58]\nMere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient to bring one into the category of an accomplice. At the same time, where the organization's\nprimary objective\nis achieved by means of crimes against humanity, or it is directed to a limited, brutal purpose, membership will generally be sufficient to establish complicity ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , FC, above, at para. 28;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 23).\n[59]\nA person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them from occurring (if he or she has the power to do so) nor disengages himself or herself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself or herself) but who lends his or her active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. That statement is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a\ncontinuous and regular\npart of the operation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , CF, above at para. 28; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 38).\n[60]\nAssociation with an organization responsible for international crimes may imply complicity if the person concerned personally or knowingly participated in the crimes, or knowingly tolerated them (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 563 (F.C.A.)).\n[61]\nThe mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity has been characterized variously as \"shared common purpose\", \"personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes\", and\nparticipation in an organization knowing it commits crimes against humanity, when combined with a failure to stop the crimes or disassociate oneself\n. (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 24).\n[62]\nA person's rank within an organization, among other things, speaks to the likelihood of that person's knowledge and involvement in the organization's bad acts. However, one need not be in a leading position in order to be found complicit. Thus, the person's position in the organization may demonstrate that person's personal and knowing participation, and ultimately the person's complicity in the organization's commission of crimes. The higher the person concerned is in the ranks of the organization, the more likely it is that he or she was aware of the crimes committed and shared the organization's purpose in committing them. Accordingly, a person who remains in a high position in the organization, knowing that it has been responsible for crimes against humanity, may be considered to be complicit (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 15-16;\nThomas\n, above, at paras. 26-48; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 44-45, 58;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 25).\nThe MLC was an organization with a limited, brutal purpose\n[63]\nIt is therefore important to determine whether, during the period when the applicant was a member, starting in 2000, the MLC may be described as an organization with a limited, brutal purpose.\n[64]\nThe caselaw indicates that an organization whose very existence \"is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means deemed necessary\" creates a presumption that mere membership in the organization implies complicity, without the need to connect the applicant's complicity to a particular crime committed by the organization (\nMoreno and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1048 (F.C.A.), at para. 45).\n[65]\nIn this case, from 2000 to the end of 2003, the years when the applicant was a member, the MLC's primary objective was to succeed in having the MLC overthrow the dictatorship of President Kabila and take power. That objective is even set out in the statutes of the movement. In addition, although the applicant was a member of the political branch of the movement and not its armed branch, as a member of the \"legal college\", it is clear that the MLC intended to achieve its objectives primarily through the actions of its armed branch, which was not separate from it. The statutes of the movement, again, are clear on that point, and it is confirmed by the documentary evidence.\n[66]\nThe evidence is that all means considered necessary were used by the MLC to achieve its objective, as described earlier: arbitrary arrests, murders, rapes, summary executions, cannibalism, massacres, systematic torture, pillaging, fires, the use of child soldiers, genocide and ethnic cleansing.\n[67]\nIn the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to conclude that, beyond a doubt, during the years when the applicant was a member, the MLC continuously and regularly engaged in crimes against humanity to achieve its political objective. This suggests that the MLC was an organization with a limited, brutal purpose ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 12). It should be noted that in that case, membership in such an organization is generally sufficient to establish complicity (\nThomas\n, above, at para. 23).\n[68]\nThe RPD could therefore reasonably have presumed that the applicant had the mental element required, the necessary mens rea, for a finding of complicity, and that he was therefore complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC from 2000 to the end of 2003.\n[69]\nHowever, that is a rebuttable presumption ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 6;\nThomas\n, above, at para. 24;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 15;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1284 (T.D.)).\n[70]\nThe case law has laid down the factors to be taken into consideration in determining whether there genuinely are serious reasons for considering that a claimant may be considered to be complicit in the commission of crimes or acts referred to in section 1F of the\nConvention\n. Those factors are: the method of recruitment, the applicant's position and rank in the organization, the nature of the organization, the applicant's knowledge of the crimes or acts committed, the length of his or her participation in the organization's activities, and the opportunity to leave ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 38-44;\nThomas\n, above, at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 7).\n[71]\nIf these factors are applied in this case, they confirm the applicant's complicity.\nNature of the organization\n[72]\nAt the relevant time, the MLC was a rebel movement and not a political party.\n[73]\nAs noted earlier, according to the abundant evidence cited by the RPD, in the years when the applicant was a member of the MLC it continuously and regularly engaged in crimes against humanity to achieve its political objective.\nMethod of recruitment\n[74]\nIt is clear that the applicant joined the MLC voluntarily: in fact, he testified that he wanted to better position himself on the political ladder and become a close government advisor when the MLC toppled President Kabila and assumed power. He also testified, (Translation) \"I espoused their political convictions; I was hoping for a new political era\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 39).\nPosition within the organization\n[75]\nThe applicant held a decision-making position, or at the very least an advisory position, as a member of the movement's legal college. He was not a subordinate who did not know the direction his organization was taking. In view of his activism and the positions he took against the government in place, he was counsel to Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was, as noted earlier, the leader of the MLC, in the Supreme Court of Justice of the DRC (TR at p. 181).\nKnowledge of atrocities\n[76]\nThe claimant's testimony regarding his knowledge of the atrocities committed by the MLC was not credible.\n[77]\nHe initially testified that he did not know any details concerning the armed branch of the MLC. However, the documentary evidence indicates that the violations committed by the ALC were well-known and highly publicized.\n[78]\nAfter several questions and confrontations, the claimant finally testified that between 2000 and 2004, he was aware of the human rights violations committed by the MLC (TR at pp. 992-993, 999, 1001, 1005-1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, 1035, 1043-1044, 1046). Concerning the massacres in North-Kivu, the applicant testified that he had been aware of them, but not in detail (TR at p. 994). He said that he heard through media reports that there was a war and, according to him, stray bullets that might hit a civilian are normal, that in a state of war, civilians sometimes died, but he was not aware that civilians were the target of attacks (TR at p. 995). When asked whether he had heard of the systematic rape of women, girls and boys as a weapon of warfare, and the murder of civilians, he claimed that he had not (TR at pp. 995-996, 998), and then admitted that he was in fact aware of that (TR at pp. 1043-1044, 1046) (Decision of the RPD at para. 44).\n[79]\nWhen he was asked whether the government talked about the abuses committed by the MLC at that time, he testified that it was difficult to treat these reports as the truth and he put them down to political brainwashing (TR at pp. 998-999, 1001-1002). However, he did not try to verify whether the reports were true because, according to his testimony, he was very busy with his work at a law firm (TR at p. 1003) (Decision of the RPD at para. 45).\n[80]\nWhen asked about the fires and massacres of entire villages in April 2001, which were widely reported in the media, the claimant testified that he had heard about the clash between the MLC and the\nmayi-mayi\n; but knew nothing about that exact incident. However, he knew that there had been massacres generally by the MLC (TR at pp. 1010-1011). Later in his testimony the applicant tried to minimize the situation, essentially saying that it depended on the meaning given to the word\nmassacre\n. (Translation) \"When I hear that someone died, am I going to try to find out if it was a massacre?\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 46; TR at pp. 1022-1024).\n[81]\nAbout operation \"Effacez le tableau\" (wipe the slate), which was widely reported in the documentary evidence, the applicant knew only that (Translation) \"the MLC killed a group of pygmies and attacked the pygmies\" (TR at p. 1011). However, he added that at first he had believed it, but then he doubted the information because it was beyond human understanding that there was cannibalism in the Congo (TR at pp. 1012-1013). When confronted with the fact that even Bemba, the leader of the MLC, admitted in January 2003 that his movement engaged in cannibalism (TR at p. 596), the applicant answered that it might have happened, but (Translation) \"the population doubts it\" (TR at pp. 1014, 1017).\n[82]\nIt was not unreasonable for the RPD not to accept these attempts to offer justification. First, the conduct of the applicant in attempting to minimize the abuses committed by the MLC, while at the same time claiming that he was not a member, was contradictory. In addition, it is implausible that the applicant was not aware of the gravity and the systematic and systemic nature of the crimes committed by the MLC (Decision of the RPD at para. 47).\n[83]\nIf, as in this case, an individual lives and works in a country where thousands of people are victims of crimes against humanity and where one hears about it, it is totally unbelievable that one would not have knowledge of what is taking place (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 133 (T.D.) at para. 25).\n[84]\nConcerning the mass recruitment of child soldiers, the applicant testified that he was aware of it, but according to him, it was done in 1998-1999 by soldiers of the former Mobutu regime, to supplement its forces (TR at pp. 1036, 1039-1040). When confronted with the fact that this practice continued in 2002, the applicant stated that he was not aware of it (Decision of the RPD at para. 48).\n[85]\nAt one point during the hearing, the applicant stopped his denials and admitted that the MLC was an armed movement before 2004 and that he knew it (TR at pp. 1046-1047), and that he knew that even the political branch supported the armed conflict, in accordance with the movement's statutes (Decision of the RPD at para. 49).\nLength of time in the organization\n[86]\nAs noted earlier, the RPD did not believe the applicant when he alleged that he did not join the MLC until 2004. Having regard to the evidence described above, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that he was an active member of the MLC starting in 2000 and until the end of 2003, during a period when the movement was continuously and regularly committing the crimes against humanity referred to earlier.\nOpportunity to leave the organization\n[87]\nThe applicant voluntarily remained with an organization that he knew was committing or had committed serious human rights violations.\n[88]\nThe applicant's testimony when confronted with the atrocities committed by the MLC was nonchalant and completely lacking in empathy for the thousands of victims. He spoke of this period in his country's history as a period of isolated incidents, (Translation) \"pockets of resistance,\" the normal consequences of war. However, the massacres of civilians, the systematic rape of women, girls and boys, and the recruitment of child soldiers are not the collateral damage of a war. The applicant's speech is that of an active member of the MLC who knew what was going on but who, out of political ambition, chose that movement, the only party that, in his opinion, could have removed either of the Kabilas from power. He testified that his goal was to become a close government advisor (TR at p. 1113; Decision of the RPD at para. 52).\n[89]\nHaving regard to the foregoing, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant had not rebutted the presumption that he was complicit in crimes against humanity committed by the MLC between 2000 and 2004.\nThe RPD did not have to conclude that a crime against humanity set out in paragraph 1F(a) committed by the MLC was necessarily and directly attributable to the specific acts or omissions of the applicant\n[90]\nThe applicant further submits that no crime set out in paragraph 1F(a) is attributable to him personally.\n[91]\nIn the case of complicity by association, it is not the nature of the crimes with which the applicant was charged that lead to his exclusion, but that of the crimes alleged against the organization with which he was associated. On that point, the Court of Appeal quoted with approval the following passage from the reasons of the Court in\nHarb\n, above, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\"[11] The first of these arguments does not apply in the case at bar. It is not the nature of the crimes with which the appellant was charged that led to his exclusion, but that of the crimes alleged against the organizations with which he was supposed to be associated. Once those organizations have committed crimes against humanity and the appellant meets the requirements for membership in the group, knowledge, participation or complicity imposed by precedent (see inter alia,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)), the exclusion applies even if the specific acts committed by the appellant himself are not crimes against humanity as such. ...\"\n[92]\nIt should also be noted that in exclusion cases the courts have never required, in order for a claimant to be found to be complicit by association, that he or she be connected with specific crimes or acts as the person who actually committed them, or that the crimes or acts committed by an organization be necessarily and directly attributable to specific omissions or acts by the claimant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 31-32; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 3-13;\nB., Re\n, [1997] E.W.J. No. 700 (C.A.), at paras. 7 et seq. (CA England and Wales);\nHarb\n, above, at para. 11; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 55-56).\nVI.\nConclusion\n[93]\nIn light of the caselaw and the evidence, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to have serious reasons for considering that the applicant has committed crimes against humanity.\n[94]\nIt was therefore not unreasonable for the RPD to exclude the applicant from the application of the\nConvention\nunder paragraph 1F(a).\n[95]\nAccordingly, the applicant may not be granted the protection of Canada, as set out in section 98 of the\nIRPA\n.\n[96]\nThe applicant had knowledge of the crimes committed by the MLC at the relevant time and he shared the criminal intentions of that organization.\n[97]\nThe applicant's entirely voluntary association with the MLC for three years, in the knowledge of the crimes committed by that organization, shows that he adhered to the purposes and practices of that movement, and this makes him complicit in those crimes.\n[98]\nAs noted earlier, citing lengthy caselaw, when an applicant is aware that the group to which he or she belongs is continuously and regularly committing crimes or acts referred to in section F of Article 1 of the\nConvention\nand does not try to disengage himself or herself from that group at the earliest opportunity, consistent with safety for himself or herself, the RPD may then reasonably conclude that the applicant cannot have status as a refugee or person in need of protection under section 98 of the\nIRPA\n.\n[99]\nIt is plain, moreover, that the crimes committed by the MLC at the relevant time, as found by the RPD, were crimes against humanity within the meaning of paragraph 1F(a).\n[100]\nAccordingly, based on the evidence and the applicable law, the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity, merely by reason of his close and voluntary association with the MLC, since he knowingly tolerated them and did not leave the movement at the earliest opportunity.\n[101]\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the exclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a) is not unreasonable and is not vitiated by any reviewable error of law.\n[102]\nFor all of the reasons set out above, the applicant's application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n[103]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n1. the applicant's application for judicial review be dismissed;\n2. no serious question of general importance be certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Sharon McCartney/vnh",

He arrived in Canada at the Lacolle, Quebec, port of entry on January 2, 2008, and claimed refugee protection in Canada on that date, under section 96 and paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the\nIRPA\n. He was carrying a Congolese passport and had spent 16 days in New York, in the United States, to attend a conference of the International Criminal Bar.\n\n[7]\nThe applicant has 17 years of education and is a member of the bar of Kinshasa-Gomba in the DRC.\n\n[8]\nThe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness intervened in this case to seek to have the applicant excluded by virtue of sections 96 and 97, under section 98 of the\nIRPA\n, because in the Minister's opinion the applicant is a person referred to in paragraphs 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the\nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n(\nConvention\n). In the Minister's opinion, there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant has committed crimes against humanity and is guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\n[9]\nThe applicant claims to fear for his life because of his political activities as a member of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a political/military movement founded in 1998 and supported by Uganda, armed by Libya and led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. By his own admission, the aim of the movement was to overthrow the dictatorial government of the DRC by political methods and armed struggle (Decision of the RPD at paras. 2 and 9).\n\n[10]\nThe applicant's problems allegedly began in late 2006 and culminated in his detention in 2007. The applicant was then supposedly released under pressure from the bar and managed to flee the DRC and go to the United States, where he was to attend a meeting of the International Criminal Bar. As noted earlier, the applicant entered Canada on January 2, 2008, and claimed refugee protection that day (Decision of the RPD at para. 2).\n\n[11]\nThe RPD agreed with the parties that it would first decide the issue of the exclusion of the applicant and, in the event that it did not exclude him, the parties would be reconvened for a hearing concerning inclusion, that is, his alleged fear of persecution (Decision of the RPD at para. 5).\n\n[12]\nOn June 4, 2010, the RPD concluded that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant \"was complicit in crimes against humanity\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 54).\n\n[13]\nAccordingly, on that date, the RPD determined that the applicant is excluded from the application of the\nConvention\nunder paragraph 1F(a) and therefore could not be granted the protection of Canada, as provided by section 98 of the\nIRPA\n(Decision of the RPD at para. 58).\n\n[14]\nIt is that decision that the applicant is contesting in this proceeding.\nIV.\nIssue\n\n[15]\nIs the exclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a) of the\nConvention\nreasonable, having regard to the evidence and the applicable law?\nV.\nAnalysis\n\n[16]\nIn the opinion of the Court, the decision is entirely justified in its context. The Court is entirely in agreement with the respondent's position.\nApplicable standards of review\n\n[17]\nThe purely factual findings on which the RPD based its reasoning in making its determination are subject to the reasonableness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2009 FC 567, at para. 14;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 44).\n\n[18] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[19]\nThe question of whether the evidence discloses serious reasons for considering that the applicant is a person described in paragraph 1F(a) is subject to the reasonableness standard (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2010 FC 1, at para. 27;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 384 N.R. 293; 2008 FCA 404).\n\n[20]\nIf the impugned decision has qualities that make it reasonable, that are concerned with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, it is reasonable ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47).\n\n[21]\nThe issue in that regard is therefore whether there was evidence on which the RPD's conclusion that there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant is a person referred to in paragraph 1F(a) could\nreasonably\nbe based. It is important to note that this Court does not perform the same functions as the RPD. The role of this Court is not to decide whether, based on the evidence submitted to the RPD, there were \"serious reasons for considering\"; it is solely to decide\nwhether it was unreasonable\nfor the RPD to reach that conclusion (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 32-33;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2010 FC 781, at para. 29;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 49; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above).\nApplicable provisions relating to grounds for exclusion\n\n[22]\nSection 98 of the\nIRPA\nreads as follows:\n\"98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\"\n\n[23]\nUnder subsection 2(1) of the\nIRPA\n, the expression \"\nRefugee Convention\n\" means the above-mentioned\nConvention\n.\n\n[24]\nThe relevant parts of section F of article 1 of the\nConvention\nread as follows:\n\"F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) He has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; ...\"\n\n[25]\nThe RPD concluded that it had serious reasons for considering that the applicant had committed crimes against humanity.\n\n[26]\nContrary to the applicant's submission, when an exclusion clause applies, the RPD need not rule as to inclusion, in particular by reason of section 98 of the\nIRPA\n(\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 38;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 388 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1017 (F.C.A.)).\nStandard of proof\n\n[27]\nThe applicable standard of proof is set out in section 1F of the\nConvention\n, under which the provisions of the\nConvention\ndo not apply to persons with respect to whom there are\nserious reasons for considering\nthat they have committed, inter alia, a crime against humanity as defined above.\n\n[28]\nAn \"exclusion\" hearing under section 1F is not of the same nature as a criminal trial, at which the Minister must prove guilt or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the Minister has the burden of proving, having regard to the evidence presented to the Board, that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that the applicant has committed a crime set out in paragraph 1F(a) or 1F(b) or has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (1F(c)) (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 132 (F.C.A.)).\n\n[29]\nIn general, the RPD must assess and weigh the evidence that it has found to be credible or trustworthy in the case and decide whether the minimum test of \"serious reasons for considering\" that the alleged crime(s) or act(s) were committed has been met. The standard of proof that must be used in applying the minimum test requires something more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities. In essence, reasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information (\nLai\n, above, at para. 25;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 114;\nCharkaoui, Re\n, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350; 358 N.R. 1; 2007 SCC 9, at para. 39).\n\n[30]\nThat standard applies to decisions as to the facts. The issue of whether the act or omission in question constitutes a crime referred to in paragraph 1F(a) is a question of law (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 26).\nExclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a\n)\nWhat is a \"crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes\"\n?\n\n[31]\nParagraph 1F(a) must be interpreted so as to include international instruments concluded since it was adopted in 1951, such that in applying that provision, regard must also be had to the definition of a crime against humanity set out in the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court\n, adopted on July 17, 1998, and in effect on July 1, 2002 (\nHarb\n, above, at para. 8).\n\n[32]\nArticle 7 of the\nRome Statute\nis important in applying paragraph 1F(a), since it contains a contemporaneous definition of crimes against humanity. The Statute is in fact the first multilateral international instrument of general application that provides a detailed definition of the list of acts characterized as crimes against humanity that were formerly recognized by various international instruments (\nHarb\n, above, at para. 7; Lison Néel, \"La judiciarisation internationale des criminels de guerre: la solution aux violations graves du droit international humanitaire?\" (2000), 33(2) Criminologie 151 at p. 166).\n\n[33]\nThe relevant parts of paragraph 7(1) of the\nRome Statute\nread as follows:\n\"... 'crime against humanity' means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:\n(a) Murder;\n(b) Extermination;\n(c) Enslavement;\n(d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population;\n(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;\n(f) Torture;\n(g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity;\n(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;\n(i) Enforced disappearance of persons;\n(j) The crime of apartheid;\n(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\"\n\n[34]\nParagraph 7(2) of the\nStatute\nprovides:\n\"2. For the purpose of paragraph 1:\n(a) 'Attack directed against any civilian population' means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack;\n. . . . .\n(c) 'Enslavement' means the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children;\n(d) 'Deportation or forcible transfer of population' means forced displacement of the persons concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law;\n. . . . .\n(g) 'Persecution' means the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity;\n. . . . .\n(i) 'Enforced disappearance of persons' means the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.\"\nCrimes against humanity committed by the MLC during the relevant period\nTime period considered\n\n[35]\nThe RPD examined the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC from June 1999 to the end of 2003, when the movement became a political party, properly speaking.\nSources of information\n\n[36]\nThe RPD relied on a very large number of excerpts from reports prepared by international organizations that monitor the human rights situation in the world, for example: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights, the United Nations Economic and Social Council and Security Council, Reporters Without Borders and the United States Country Reports on Human Rights. These are reliable sources.\n\n[37]\nContrary to the applicant's submission, the RPD referred in its reasons concerning the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC at the relevant time to a number of specific documents from the above-mentioned sources of information (on this point, see footnotes 5 to 14, inclusive, and 29 to 35, inclusive, of the panel's reasons).\nCrimes in issue\n\n[38]\nAccording to extensive and overwhelming documentary evidence, members of the MLC committed murders of civilians, rape against women, girls and boys, arrests and arbitrary detentions, kidnappings, disappearances and arbitrary killings of civilians, torture, abduction for the purpose of forced labour, massacres, fires and pillaging of homes abandoned by fleeing populations with entire villages destroyed from top to bottom, forcible transfers of populations (over 10,000 people), genocide and ethnic cleansing, in the DRC and Central Africa, as premeditated tools of warfare. According to the evidence, all of these horrors were committed on a large scale, and thousands and thousands of innocent victims were targeted.\n\n[39]\nThe evidence also reports incidents of cannibalism by soldiers of the Armée de Libération du Congo (ALC (army for the liberation of Congo)), the armed branch of the MLC, with the knowledge of MLC leaders. The evidence further reports that the ALC recruited thousands of child soldiers and that in certain areas they constituted up to 40% of the armed forces. These children were subjected to unimaginable horrors, forced to fight and often to kill their own families, forced to engage in cannibalism, raped and used as sex slaves. It is important to point out that the ALC is an integral part of the MLC, which is clearly stated in the MLC's statutes.\nCrimes against humanity\n\n[40]\nHaving regard to that evidence, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the MLC had, from 1999 to 2003, systematically engaged in a very large number of barbarous and inhumane acts and severe persecution, and that the persecution was widespread and systematic against the civilian population and the groups targeted.\n\n[41]\nThese crimes, committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population and with knowledge of the attack, pursuant to or in furtherance of an organizational policy to commit such attack, are crimes against humanity as set out in the following subparagraphs of the\nRome Statute\n: 7(1)(a) (murder), 7(1)(c) and 7(2)(c) (enslavement), 7(1)(d) and 7(2)(d) (forcible transfer of population), 7(1)(e) (imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law), 7(1)(f) and 7(2)(e) (torture), 7(1)(g) (rape, sexual slavery), 7(1)(h) and 7(2)(g) (persecution), 7(1)(i) (enforced disappearance of persons) and 7(1)(k) (other inhumane acts of a similar character) of the\nRome Statute\n.\n\n[42]\nThe abuses committed by the MLC in Central Africa in 2002-2003 were denounced by the Central African Republic, which submitted the case to the International Criminal Court in 2006. In 2007, an international arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity was issued against the leader of the MLC, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was arrested in Brussels that year. In January 2009, his trial was in progress.\n\n[43]\nIn the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the MLC committed crimes against humanity during the relevant period.\nComplicity of the applicant by association\n\n[44]\nThe RPD considered whether there are serious reasons for considering that the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity, either as an actor or as an accomplice, given that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the applicant himself committed the acts referred to in the documentary evidence.\n\n[45]\nThe RPD therefore focused its analysis on the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC at the relevant time, to determine whether they could support an inference of complicity on the part of the applicant.\nPeriod of time during which the applicant was a member of the MLC\n\n[46]\nDuring his testimony at the hearing, the applicant denied that he was member of the MLC during the period that this movement committed the crimes mentioned. At the beginning of his testimony at the hearing, he alleged that he only joined the MLC in 2004 and that before that date, in 2002, he had briefly been a member of a welcoming committee whose goal was to welcome the MLC if it ever arrived in Kinshasa. He explained that as an elite intellectual, he wanted to ensure that he enjoyed certain benefits as soon as the MLC arrived, such as obtaining prestigious government positions, for example, adviser to a minister. He also claimed that after a few months, this welcoming committee had ceased to exist. The applicant alleged that he was not involved in any political activities until August 2004, when he officially joined the MLC.\n\n[47]\nIn the form he completed when he claimed refugee protection, the applicant indicated, however, that he became a member of the MLC's legal college in May 2000; he did not indicate that he had ceased being a member. Confronted with these major contradictions, the applicant first corrected his testimony and stated that he did indeed join the welcoming committee in 2000, and not in 2002. As for the contradiction between a (Translation) \"welcoming committee\" and a (Translation) \"legal college\", the applicant explained that these terms refer to the same organization.\n\n[48]\nAs for why he did not indicate in his form at the port of entry that he had ceased being a member of the \"welcoming committee / legal college\" in 2000 and that he did not join the MLC itself until 2004, but rather indicated that he had been a member of the MLC since 2000 without interruption, the applicant testified that it is in his nature to explain everything and that there was not enough space in the form to write down every detail.\n\n[49]\nThe evidence contains another key statement from the applicant: he was summoned for an expedited interview on January 8, 2009. During the interview, which was recorded, the RPD officer explained to the applicant that his membership in the MLC could be problematic, given the human rights violations committed by that movement. After this clearly worded warning, the applicant stated that he was indeed a member of the MLC; when asked since when, he stated that he had been (Translation) \"a contributing member since 2000\". On that statement, the expedited interview ended (Tribunal Record (TR), at pp. 75-76, 1090-1108, 1115-1116).\n\n[50]\nAt the hearing before the RPD, the applicant was confronted with the statements he made at the expedited interview. He then changed his account and indicated that he had meant to say welcoming committee when he said MLC. He was going to explain himself at the end of the interview, but found himself in the situation of being unable to explain.\n\n[51]\nWhen asked at the hearing for his definition of \"contributing member,\" the expression that he had used at the expedited interview, the applicant testified that he was talking about the welcoming committee.\n\n[52]\nAt the hearing in March 2010, the applicant tried to change testimony that he subsequently realized was highly incriminating, given the Minister's intervention submitted in March 2009. It can reasonably be considered that both at the port of entry in January 2008 and at his expedited interview in January 2009 he\nspontaneously\ntold the truth about his membership in the MLC.\n\n[53]\nA person's first story is usually the most genuine and, therefore, the one to be most believed (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 21;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 14).\n\n[54]\nThere is no reason here to doubt the truth and accuracy of the statements made by the applicant to the immigration officer at the port of entry and before the RPD at the expedited process stage. Moreover, the applicant is an educated man, given that he is a lawyer, and speaks excellent French. It is therefore reasonable to expect him to be able to give the immigration officer and the Board a clear explanation of his reasons for leaving his country. Finally, this is not a case in which the evidence on record shows that real prejudice was caused to a claimant for refugee protection because of flagrant mistakes in interpretation made by an interpreter at the hearing or at the initial interview with the immigration officer ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 15).\n\n[55]\nGiven his level of education and especially his profession, the applicant should have known the importance of the statements he was making to the Canadian immigration authorities, whom he was asking to protect him.\n\n[56]\nAccordingly, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant had been a member of the MLC since 2000 and that he had not ceased to be a member until he left the DRC in 2007.\nThe caselaw on complicity by association\n\n[57]\nAccomplices as well as principal actors may be found to have committed crimes within the meaning of international criminal law: international crimes. The concept of complicity is recognized in the caselaw, defined as personal and knowing participation, and complicity by association, whereby individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close and voluntary association with the principal actors in an organization that commits international crimes.\nComplicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that the individual in question has of the commission of the crimes\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 27, aff'd 2005 FCA 303;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 28).\n\n[58]\nMere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient to bring one into the category of an accomplice. At the same time, where the organization's\nprimary objective\nis achieved by means of crimes against humanity, or it is directed to a limited, brutal purpose, membership will generally be sufficient to establish complicity ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , FC, above, at para. 28;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 23).\n\n[59]\nA person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them from occurring (if he or she has the power to do so) nor disengages himself or herself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself or herself) but who lends his or her active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. That statement is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a\ncontinuous and regular\npart of the operation ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , CF, above at para. 28; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 38).\n\n[60]\nAssociation with an organization responsible for international crimes may imply complicity if the person concerned personally or knowingly participated in the crimes, or knowingly tolerated them (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 563 (F.C.A.)).\n\n[61]\nThe mental element required to establish complicity in crimes against humanity has been characterized variously as \"shared common purpose\", \"personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes\", and\nparticipation in an organization knowing it commits crimes against humanity, when combined with a failure to stop the crimes or disassociate oneself\n. (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 24).\n\n[62]\nA person's rank within an organization, among other things, speaks to the likelihood of that person's knowledge and involvement in the organization's bad acts. However, one need not be in a leading position in order to be found complicit. Thus, the person's position in the organization may demonstrate that person's personal and knowing participation, and ultimately the person's complicity in the organization's commission of crimes. The higher the person concerned is in the ranks of the organization, the more likely it is that he or she was aware of the crimes committed and shared the organization's purpose in committing them. Accordingly, a person who remains in a high position in the organization, knowing that it has been responsible for crimes against humanity, may be considered to be complicit (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paras. 15-16;\nThomas\n, above, at paras. 26-48; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 44-45, 58;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 25).\nThe MLC was an organization with a limited, brutal purpose\n\n[63]\nIt is therefore important to determine whether, during the period when the applicant was a member, starting in 2000, the MLC may be described as an organization with a limited, brutal purpose.\n\n[64]\nThe caselaw indicates that an organization whose very existence \"is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means deemed necessary\" creates a presumption that mere membership in the organization implies complicity, without the need to connect the applicant's complicity to a particular crime committed by the organization (\nMoreno and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1048 (F.C.A.), at para. 45).\n\n[65]\nIn this case, from 2000 to the end of 2003, the years when the applicant was a member, the MLC's primary objective was to succeed in having the MLC overthrow the dictatorship of President Kabila and take power. That objective is even set out in the statutes of the movement. In addition, although the applicant was a member of the political branch of the movement and not its armed branch, as a member of the \"legal college\", it is clear that the MLC intended to achieve its objectives primarily through the actions of its armed branch, which was not separate from it. The statutes of the movement, again, are clear on that point, and it is confirmed by the documentary evidence.\n\n[66]\nThe evidence is that all means considered necessary were used by the MLC to achieve its objective, as described earlier: arbitrary arrests, murders, rapes, summary executions, cannibalism, massacres, systematic torture, pillaging, fires, the use of child soldiers, genocide and ethnic cleansing.\n\n[67]\nIn the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to conclude that, beyond a doubt, during the years when the applicant was a member, the MLC continuously and regularly engaged in crimes against humanity to achieve its political objective. This suggests that the MLC was an organization with a limited, brutal purpose ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 12). It should be noted that in that case, membership in such an organization is generally sufficient to establish complicity (\nThomas\n, above, at para. 23).\n\n[68]\nThe RPD could therefore reasonably have presumed that the applicant had the mental element required, the necessary mens rea, for a finding of complicity, and that he was therefore complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by the MLC from 2000 to the end of 2003.\n\n[69]\nHowever, that is a rebuttable presumption ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 6;\nThomas\n, above, at para. 24;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 15;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 1284 (T.D.)).\n\n[70]\nThe case law has laid down the factors to be taken into consideration in determining whether there genuinely are serious reasons for considering that a claimant may be considered to be complicit in the commission of crimes or acts referred to in section 1F of the\nConvention\n. Those factors are: the method of recruitment, the applicant's position and rank in the organization, the nature of the organization, the applicant's knowledge of the crimes or acts committed, the length of his or her participation in the organization's activities, and the opportunity to leave ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 38-44;\nThomas\n, above, at para. 20;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 7).\n\n[71]\nIf these factors are applied in this case, they confirm the applicant's complicity.\nNature of the organization\n\n[72]\nAt the relevant time, the MLC was a rebel movement and not a political party.\n\n[73]\nAs noted earlier, according to the abundant evidence cited by the RPD, in the years when the applicant was a member of the MLC it continuously and regularly engaged in crimes against humanity to achieve its political objective.\nMethod of recruitment\n\n[74]\nIt is clear that the applicant joined the MLC voluntarily: in fact, he testified that he wanted to better position himself on the political ladder and become a close government advisor when the MLC toppled President Kabila and assumed power. He also testified, (Translation) \"I espoused their political convictions; I was hoping for a new political era\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 39).\nPosition within the organization\n\n[75]\nThe applicant held a decision-making position, or at the very least an advisory position, as a member of the movement's legal college. He was not a subordinate who did not know the direction his organization was taking. In view of his activism and the positions he took against the government in place, he was counsel to Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, who was, as noted earlier, the leader of the MLC, in the Supreme Court of Justice of the DRC (TR at p. 181).\nKnowledge of atrocities\n\n[76]\nThe claimant's testimony regarding his knowledge of the atrocities committed by the MLC was not credible.\n\n[77]\nHe initially testified that he did not know any details concerning the armed branch of the MLC. However, the documentary evidence indicates that the violations committed by the ALC were well-known and highly publicized.\n\n[78]\nAfter several questions and confrontations, the claimant finally testified that between 2000 and 2004, he was aware of the human rights violations committed by the MLC (TR at pp. 992-993, 999, 1001, 1005-1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, 1035, 1043-1044, 1046). Concerning the massacres in North-Kivu, the applicant testified that he had been aware of them, but not in detail (TR at p. 994). He said that he heard through media reports that there was a war and, according to him, stray bullets that might hit a civilian are normal, that in a state of war, civilians sometimes died, but he was not aware that civilians were the target of attacks (TR at p. 995). When asked whether he had heard of the systematic rape of women, girls and boys as a weapon of warfare, and the murder of civilians, he claimed that he had not (TR at pp. 995-996, 998), and then admitted that he was in fact aware of that (TR at pp. 1043-1044, 1046) (Decision of the RPD at para. 44).\n\n[79]\nWhen he was asked whether the government talked about the abuses committed by the MLC at that time, he testified that it was difficult to treat these reports as the truth and he put them down to political brainwashing (TR at pp. 998-999, 1001-1002). However, he did not try to verify whether the reports were true because, according to his testimony, he was very busy with his work at a law firm (TR at p. 1003) (Decision of the RPD at para. 45).\n\n[80]\nWhen asked about the fires and massacres of entire villages in April 2001, which were widely reported in the media, the claimant testified that he had heard about the clash between the MLC and the\nmayi-mayi\n; but knew nothing about that exact incident. However, he knew that there had been massacres generally by the MLC (TR at pp. 1010-1011). Later in his testimony the applicant tried to minimize the situation, essentially saying that it depended on the meaning given to the word\nmassacre\n. (Translation) \"When I hear that someone died, am I going to try to find out if it was a massacre?\" (Decision of the RPD at para. 46; TR at pp. 1022-1024).\n\n[81]\nAbout operation \"Effacez le tableau\" (wipe the slate), which was widely reported in the documentary evidence, the applicant knew only that (Translation) \"the MLC killed a group of pygmies and attacked the pygmies\" (TR at p. 1011). However, he added that at first he had believed it, but then he doubted the information because it was beyond human understanding that there was cannibalism in the Congo (TR at pp. 1012-1013). When confronted with the fact that even Bemba, the leader of the MLC, admitted in January 2003 that his movement engaged in cannibalism (TR at p. 596), the applicant answered that it might have happened, but (Translation) \"the population doubts it\" (TR at pp. 1014, 1017).\n\n[82]\nIt was not unreasonable for the RPD not to accept these attempts to offer justification. First, the conduct of the applicant in attempting to minimize the abuses committed by the MLC, while at the same time claiming that he was not a member, was contradictory. In addition, it is implausible that the applicant was not aware of the gravity and the systematic and systemic nature of the crimes committed by the MLC (Decision of the RPD at para. 47).\n\n[83]\nIf, as in this case, an individual lives and works in a country where thousands of people are victims of crimes against humanity and where one hears about it, it is totally unbelievable that one would not have knowledge of what is taking place (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 133 (T.D.) at para. 25).\n\n[84]\nConcerning the mass recruitment of child soldiers, the applicant testified that he was aware of it, but according to him, it was done in 1998-1999 by soldiers of the former Mobutu regime, to supplement its forces (TR at pp. 1036, 1039-1040). When confronted with the fact that this practice continued in 2002, the applicant stated that he was not aware of it (Decision of the RPD at para. 48).\n\n[85]\nAt one point during the hearing, the applicant stopped his denials and admitted that the MLC was an armed movement before 2004 and that he knew it (TR at pp. 1046-1047), and that he knew that even the political branch supported the armed conflict, in accordance with the movement's statutes (Decision of the RPD at para. 49).\nLength of time in the organization\n\n[86]\nAs noted earlier, the RPD did not believe the applicant when he alleged that he did not join the MLC until 2004. Having regard to the evidence described above, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that he was an active member of the MLC starting in 2000 and until the end of 2003, during a period when the movement was continuously and regularly committing the crimes against humanity referred to earlier.\nOpportunity to leave the organization\n\n[87]\nThe applicant voluntarily remained with an organization that he knew was committing or had committed serious human rights violations.\n\n[88]\nThe applicant's testimony when confronted with the atrocities committed by the MLC was nonchalant and completely lacking in empathy for the thousands of victims. He spoke of this period in his country's history as a period of isolated incidents, (Translation) \"pockets of resistance,\" the normal consequences of war. However, the massacres of civilians, the systematic rape of women, girls and boys, and the recruitment of child soldiers are not the collateral damage of a war. The applicant's speech is that of an active member of the MLC who knew what was going on but who, out of political ambition, chose that movement, the only party that, in his opinion, could have removed either of the Kabilas from power. He testified that his goal was to become a close government advisor (TR at p. 1113; Decision of the RPD at para. 52).\n\n[89]\nHaving regard to the foregoing, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant had not rebutted the presumption that he was complicit in crimes against humanity committed by the MLC between 2000 and 2004.\nThe RPD did not have to conclude that a crime against humanity set out in paragraph 1F(a) committed by the MLC was necessarily and directly attributable to the specific acts or omissions of the applicant\n\n[90]\nThe applicant further submits that no crime set out in paragraph 1F(a) is attributable to him personally.\n\n[91]\nIn the case of complicity by association, it is not the nature of the crimes with which the applicant was charged that lead to his exclusion, but that of the crimes alleged against the organization with which he was associated. On that point, the Court of Appeal quoted with approval the following passage from the reasons of the Court in\nHarb\n, above, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\" [11] The first of these arguments does not apply in the case at bar. It is not the nature of the crimes with which the appellant was charged that led to his exclusion, but that of the crimes alleged against the organizations with which he was supposed to be associated. Once those organizations have committed crimes against humanity and the appellant meets the requirements for membership in the group, knowledge, participation or complicity imposed by precedent (see inter alia,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)), the exclusion applies even if the specific acts committed by the appellant himself are not crimes against humanity as such. ...\"\n\n[92]\nIt should also be noted that in exclusion cases the courts have never required, in order for a claimant to be found to be complicit by association, that he or she be connected with specific crimes or acts as the person who actually committed them, or that the crimes or acts committed by an organization be necessarily and directly attributable to specific omissions or acts by the claimant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 31-32; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 3-13;\nB., Re\n, [1997] E.W.J. No. 700 (C.A.), at paras. 7 et seq. (CA England and Wales);\nHarb\n, above, at para. 11; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras. 55-56).\nVI.\nConclusion\n\n[93]\nIn light of the caselaw and the evidence, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to have serious reasons for considering that the applicant has committed crimes against humanity.\n\n[94]\nIt was therefore not unreasonable for the RPD to exclude the applicant from the application of the\nConvention\nunder paragraph 1F(a).\n\n[95]\nAccordingly, the applicant may not be granted the protection of Canada, as set out in section 98 of the\nIRPA\n.\n\n[96]\nThe applicant had knowledge of the crimes committed by the MLC at the relevant time and he shared the criminal intentions of that organization.\n\n[97]\nThe applicant's entirely voluntary association with the MLC for three years, in the knowledge of the crimes committed by that organization, shows that he adhered to the purposes and practices of that movement, and this makes him complicit in those crimes.\n\n[98]\nAs noted earlier, citing lengthy caselaw, when an applicant is aware that the group to which he or she belongs is continuously and regularly committing crimes or acts referred to in section F of Article 1 of the\nConvention\nand does not try to disengage himself or herself from that group at the earliest opportunity, consistent with safety for himself or herself, the RPD may then reasonably conclude that the applicant cannot have status as a refugee or person in need of protection under section 98 of the\nIRPA\n.\n\n[99]\nIt is plain, moreover, that the crimes committed by the MLC at the relevant time, as found by the RPD, were crimes against humanity within the meaning of paragraph 1F(a).\n\n[100]\nAccordingly, based on the evidence and the applicable law, the applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity, merely by reason of his close and voluntary association with the MLC, since he knowingly tolerated them and did not leave the movement at the earliest opportunity.\n\n[101]\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the exclusion of the applicant under paragraph 1F(a) is not unreasonable and is not vitiated by any reviewable error of law.\n\n[102]\nFor all of the reasons set out above, the applicant's application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[103]\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n1. the applicant's application for judicial review be dismissed;\n2. no serious question of general importance be certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Sharon McCartney/vnh",

    "factual_background": [
      "An individual, Ambroise Mapangu Ishaku, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a lawyer, claimed refugee protection in Canada in January 2008.",
      "Prior to arriving in Canada, Ishaku spent 16 days in the United States attending a conference of the International Criminal Bar.",
      "The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness sought to exclude Ishaku based on concerns he may have committed crimes against humanity and acts contrary to the principles of the United Nations.",
      "Ishaku stated his fear for his life stemmed from his political activities as a member of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), founded in 1998 and supported by Uganda and armed by Libya.",
      "The MLC aimed to overthrow the government of the DRC through political and armed means.",
      "Ishaku's alleged involvement with the MLC began in late 2006, leading to his detention in 2007 and subsequent flight to the United States.",
      "The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) initially focused on the issue of Ishaku's exclusion before addressing his claim for refugee protection.",
      "The RPD concluded there were serious reasons to believe Ishaku was complicit in crimes against humanity.",
      "The RPD’s decision was based on evidence of crimes committed by the MLC between 1999 and 2003, including murders, rape, arbitrary detentions, and other atrocities.",
      "Ishaku provided differing accounts of his involvement with the MLC, initially claiming membership in 2004, then stating earlier involvement through a 'welcoming committee,' and later admitting membership since 2000.",
      "During questioning, Ishaku’s statements regarding his knowledge of MLC atrocities and his level of involvement evolved.",
      "The RPD relied on reports from international organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch regarding the MLC’s activities."

    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "Denied being a member of the MLC during the period crimes were committed, initially claiming membership only began in 2004.",
        "Claimed initial membership was in a 'welcoming committee' and not the MLC itself.",
        "Argued that his statements about MLC membership were due to a desire for benefits and a misunderstanding of the form's limitations.",
        "Contended he was unaware of the details of atrocities committed by the MLC, hearing only of 'pockets of resistance' and 'stray bullets'.",
        "Claimed he doubted reports of atrocities, attributing them to political brainwashing.",
        "Argued that the RPD's conclusion lacked a direct link between his actions and specific crimes against humanity.",
        "Submitted that no crime under paragraph 1F(a) was directly attributable to him personally.",
        "Maintained he did not share the criminal intentions of the MLC."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The applicant was a member of the MLC from 2000 until he left the DRC in 2007.",
        "The MLC systematically engaged in crimes against humanity (murder, rape, torture, imprisonment, forced displacement, etc.) to achieve its political objectives.",
        "The applicant had knowledge of the atrocities committed by the MLC, despite his claims to the contrary.",
        "The applicant's initial statements regarding his MLC membership were truthful and more credible than his later revisions.",
        "The applicant did not disassociate himself from the MLC despite being aware of its criminal activities.",
        "Membership in an organization with a brutal purpose, like the MLC, implies complicity, even without direct involvement in specific crimes.",
        "The applicant's position within the MLC (member of the legal college, counsel to Bemba) demonstrates knowledge and participation.",
        "The applicant's lack of empathy and nonchalant attitude towards the atrocities suggest complicity.",
        "The standard of proof requires demonstrating 'serious reasons for considering' complicity, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "The RPD did not need to attribute specific crimes to the applicant directly; complicity by association is sufficient."

    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed the Refugee Protection Division’s (RPD) decision to exclude the applicant from refugee protection under paragraph 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, finding the decision reasonable.",
      "The court applied the reasonableness standard of review to both the RPD’s factual findings and its legal conclusions regarding ‘serious reasons for considering’ the applicant’s complicity in crimes against humanity.",
      "The court determined that the RPD correctly interpreted paragraph 1F(a) to include international instruments adopted after 1951, specifically referencing the Rome Statute’s definition of crimes against humanity.",
      "The court found the RPD’s assessment of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) as an organization committing crimes against humanity to be reasonable, based on extensive documentary evidence from reliable sources like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.",
      "The court upheld the RPD’s finding that the applicant was a member of the MLC from 2000 to 2003, a period when the MLC was actively committing crimes against humanity, finding the applicant’s shifting testimony regarding his involvement to be inconsistent and unreliable.",
      "The court applied caselaw establishing that complicity in crimes against humanity can be found through association with an organization committing such crimes, even without direct participation in specific acts, particularly when the organization’s purpose is achieved through brutal means.",
      "The court reasoned that the applicant’s voluntary and prolonged association with the MLC, coupled with his knowledge of the atrocities committed, demonstrated complicity, as he neither attempted to prevent the crimes nor disassociate himself.",
      "The court clarified that establishing complicity did not require proving the applicant directly committed specific crimes, but rather that he shared the criminal intentions of the MLC and knowingly tolerated its actions.",
      "The court emphasized that the standard of proof required for exclusion under 1F(a) is ‘serious reasons for considering,’ which falls between mere suspicion and proof on a balance of probabilities, and that the RPD met this standard.",
      "The court found the RPD’s conclusion that the applicant had the necessary *mens rea* (mental element) for complicity to be reasonable, given his position within the MLC and his apparent lack of concern for the victims of the organization’s crimes."

    "final_outcome": [
      "The applicant's application for judicial review is dismissed.",
      "No serious question of general importance is certified."
