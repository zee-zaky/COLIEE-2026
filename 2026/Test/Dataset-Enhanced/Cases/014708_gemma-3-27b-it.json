    "[1]\nTremblay-Lamer, J.\n[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review from a decision by Martine Beaulac, post-claim determination officer, on October 5, 1999 that the plaintiffs are not members of the post-determination refugee claimants in Canada class (hereinafter \"PDRCC\"), as defined in s. 2(1) of the\nImmigration Regulations\n, 1978. [see footnote 1]",
    "[2]\nThe reviewing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were not members of the PDRCC class because there were no objectively identifiable risks to which other persons from Pakistan were not exposed.",
    "[3]\nShe based her decision essentially on (i) the lack of credibility found by the Refugee Division regarding the plaintiff's political involvement, (ii) the fact that the plaintiff, an educated woman who was an independent worker living in an urban centre, who could return to her country and who was able to come back to Canada without difficulty, was not in a vulnerable position, and (iii) the fact that the allegations of problems resulting from the plaintiffs' religion were not supported by the reference documents.",
    "[4]\nThe plaintiffs submitted that the reviewing officer was influenced by matters external to the record, namely that the female plaintiff's husband was in an illegal situation in Canada.",
    "[5]\nIn fact, in assessing the risks of return, and in particular under the heading (TRANSLATION) \"risk(s) identified by applicant(s)\", the officer noted the following in her notes:\n(TRANSLATION) \"... I note that the subjects, that is the female claimant and her child, left Canada on January 24, 1994 and returned to Pakistan and came back on February 10, 1998, submitting a new application for refugee status in Canada.\nThe female claimant's husband remained in Canada and is still being sought by the Immigration authorities\n.\" [see footnote 2] (My emphasis.)",
    "[6]\nIn my view, these comments may be regarded as extrinsic evidence since the unfavourable decision on the plaintiffs' case, to the effect that they do not face risks on returning to Pakistan, is in no way based on comments related to the husband.",
    "[7]\nThe plaintiffs further argued that there was an apparent bias in the fact that the reviewing officer made two assessments of the risk incurred by the plaintiffs if they returned. I am not of that view.",
    "[8]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  clearly stated that the mere fact of a second hearing before the same adjudicator, without more, did not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. [see footnote 4] That case concerned a quasi-judicial decision. A fortiori this principle will apply to an administrative decision, where the requirements of natural justice are less stringent.",
    "[9]\nAs regards the comments on the presence in Canada of certain members of the plaintiffs' family, the reviewing officer's decision dealt only with risks of return. Although I find these comments gratuitous, they did not deal with the issue and so had no impact on the decision made regarding risks of return.",
    "[10]\nAs he has already done in the past, counsel for the plaintiff tried to present new arguments at the hearing which did not appear anywhere in his principal memorandum or in his reply memorandum. I refused to hear his arguments. In my opinion, such a tactic by counsel is not acceptable since it prejudices the opposing party, who is obviously taken by surprise. Further, it is clear that the Court is not in a position to fully assess the merits of a new argument suddenly raised at the hearing. This practice is all the more surprising as under Rule 13 of the\nFederal Court Immigration Rules, 1993\n[see footnote 5] it is possible to file a reply memorandum after the defendant's memorandum is filed as well as a supplementary memorandum under Rule 15.",
    "[11]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that had not been raised in his memorandum. More recently, Richard, J., relied on that judgment in also refusing to hear new arguments at a hearing which were not in the memorandum. [see footnote 7] I accept that there may be very special circumstances in which it is in the interests of justice to hear a plaintiff on a new argument. In my opinion, such a situation requires an adjournment to give the defendant an opportunity to prepare adequately. However, such a situation can only be exceptional since all counsel would have to do is appear on the day of the hearing with a new argument and thereby be granted an adjournment which he could not have obtained if he had confined himself to the argument appearing in his memorandum.",
    "[12]\nOne final observation: the structure of the\nFederal Court Rules, 1998\n[see footnote 8] provides for the filing of a memorandum in support of the reasons given by a plaintiff as the basis of the application for leave and application for judicial review. It is on the basis of the reasons given in this memorandum, and if applicable in the defendant's memorandum and the memorandum in reply, that the application for leave will or will not be granted by a judge of the Court. Apart from exceptional cases, this is one more reason why in my opinion it is not appropriate to disregard the arguments for which leave has been given and present new arguments at the hearing without the latter being the subject of the same consideration at the time of the application for leave.",
    "[13]\nFor these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Sharon J.

      "The court rejected the argument of apparent bias due to a second assessment of risk, citing precedent that a second hearing before the same adjudicator does not automatically create a reasonable apprehension of bias, particularly in administrative decisions where the standard of natural justice is less stringent.",
      "The court established a firm procedural rule against hearing new arguments at the judicial review hearing that were not presented in the initial or reply memoranda, reasoning that it prejudices the opposing party and prevents adequate assessment of the new argument. It acknowledged potential exceptions requiring an adjournment for the opposing party to prepare, but emphasized these should be rare.",
      "The court reinforced the importance of the memorandum system within the Federal Court Rules, stating that applications for leave and judicial review are based on the arguments presented in those memoranda, and deviating from this process is inappropriate except in exceptional circumstances.",
      "Ultimately, the court dismissed the application for judicial review, upholding the reviewing officer’s decision that the plaintiffs were not members of the PDRCC class, based on the procedural grounds of improperly raised arguments and the lack of demonstrated bias or error in the original decision-making process."
