Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\nI.\nOverview",
    "[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: In 2009, Mr. Roberto Eduardo Amaya Jerez fled his native El Salvador and claimed refugee protection in Canada. He claims to fear drug dealers who tried to force him to sell drugs in the restaurant he owned in the town of San Martin.",
    "[2]\nA panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed Mr. Amaya Jerez's claim, finding that his fear was not related to any ground recognized in the Refugee Convention, and that he was not subject to a personal risk of mistreatment. Rather, he was exposed to a generalized risk of crime.",
    "[3]\nMr. Amaya Jerez argues that the Board erred in both of its findings. He submits that the Board ignored evidence that he was perceived to be a gay man and was persecuted, at least in part, for that reason. Further, he contends that the Board's conclusion that he was exposed to a generalized risk, not a personal risk, was unreasonable on the evidence.",
    "[4]\nIn my view, the Board did not overlook significant evidence. In addition, its conclusions were reasonable on the evidence before it.",
    "[5]\nThere are two issues:\ni. Did the Board overlook evidence?\nii. Was the Board's decision unreasonable?\nII.\nFactual Background",
    "[6]\nIn 2003, Mr. Amaya Jerez and his wife opened a small restaurant in San Martin, which attracted a wide range of clientele including gay customers and local drug dealers. One of those drug dealers, a man called \"El Chino Tres Colas\", attempted to enlist Mr. Amaya Jerez to sell drugs in the restaurant. Mr. Amaya said no.",
    "[7]\nIn 2004, two of Chino Tres Colas' associates, known as \"Cousin\" and \"El Tabatha\", told Mr. Amaya Jerez that he would have to cooperate. They put a gun to Mr. Amaya Jerez's head and threatened his pregnant wife by pointing a gun at her belly and vagina. Mr. Amaya Jerez was beaten. During the assault, the gang members forced a gun into Mr. Amaya Jerez's underwear and said, \"[y]ou allow fags in the restaurant and therefore you must be one of them\".",
    "[8]\nMr. Amaya Jerez made arrangements to send his wife to another town and started to close his business. Cousin and four other gang members told Mr. Amaya Jerez that he was not allowed to refuse, and that they knew where his wife was. They beat Mr. Amaya Jerez, suggested again that he must be homosexual, and assaulted him by putting a gun in his underwear.",
    "[9]\nMr. Amaya Jerez did not make a police complaint because he had seen prominent police officers, including the local chief of police, socializing at his restaurant with the same drug dealers he feared. However, Mr. Amaya Jerez sought medical attention and was hospitalized for three days. His family physician stated that he had injuries all over his body, including a head wound that required five stitches, serious bruising and lacerations on his back, and signs of sexual abuse in the anal and genital region.",
    "[10]\nMr. Amaya Jerez fled San Martin and moved to San Salvador with his wife, obtained a new job, and was living there until July 2007, when he was surrounded by people asking for money. One of them was Cousin, who recognized Mr. Amaya Jerez from San Martin.",
    "[11]\nCousin stole Mr. Amaya Jerez's wallet and keys, told him he would kill him if he went to the police, and reminded him that there was unfinished business with Chino Tres Colas. Mr. Amaya Jerez and his wife moved to another city, Chalchuapa, and hid at home when they were not working. He felt he could not live that way forever, so he decided to leave the country.",
    "[12]\nMr. Amaya Jerez obtained a Canadian work visa and entered Canada in 2009. After he left El Salvador, his wife was approached by gang members who attempted to kidnap their child. She was also approached by other men who asked where Mr. Amaya Jerez was.",
    "[13]\nIn Canada, the job Mr. Amaya Jerez had been promised never materialized and he was unable to renew his work permit. Fearing a return to El Salvador, he made a refugee claim in June 2010.\nIII.\nThe Board's Decision",
    "[14]\nThe Board found Mr. Amaya Perez to be a truthful witness. Further, his account of events was consistent with the documentary evidence, which stated that El Salvador has an extremely serious crime problem, including extortion and violence by drug traffickers. Furthermore, the documentary evidence confirmed the existence of the drug dealer, Chino Tres Colas. He is a well-known, high-ranking leader of the Mara 18, an organization that is known for drug trafficking and committing street crimes. News reports stated that Chino Tres Colas has recently been prosecuted for his violent crimes.",
    "[15]\nThe Board noted Mr. Amaya Jerez's claim that he had been subject to sexual violence. While it concluded that his allegations were substantially true, it found that they did not support a claim under ss 96 or 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] (see Annex for statutory reference).",
    "[16]\nFirst, he had not shown a nexus to a Convention ground. In essence, Mr. Amaya Jerez was a victim of criminality, having been extorted and pressured to sell drugs, and attacked when he refused. This treatment had no connection to any of the grounds of persecution recognized in s 96.",
    "[17]\nSecond, s 97 of IRPA protects those facing a risk not faced generally by others in the country. The Board noted that, although Mr. Amaya Jerez had been personally affected by the events in El Salvador, he did not face a personalized risk of mistreatment. Mr. Amaya Jerez came to the attention of Chino Tres Colas because he was a potential source of revenue. Furthermore, the documentary evidence confirmed that there are many gang members active in El Salvador who extort money from the general population. The Board concluded that all people with businesses, facilities or assets faced a generalized risk.",
    "[18]\nMr. Amaya Jerez had argued that he faced a personalized risk because his mistreatment, in part, was based on the fact that he was perceived to be homosexual. The Board disagreed. It found no evidence that the claimant was perceived to be a gay man in El Salvador. The alleged agents of persecution knew he was a married man with children. Furthermore, when questioned, Mr. Amaya Jerez did not allege that he has any gay self-identity. The Board stated that, although the criminals who assaulted Mr. Amaya Jerez suggested he must be gay, they did not do so because they genuinely believed that he was homosexual.",
    "[19]\nAccordingly, the Board found that the issue of persecution on grounds of sexual orientation was not supported by the evidence. It found Mr. Amaya Jerez not to be a person in need of protection under s 97 of IRPA, nor a Convention refugee under s 96.\nIV.\nIssue One - Did the Board overlook evidence?",
    "[20]\nMr. Amaya Jerez submits the Board stated incorrectly that \"[t]here is no evidence the claimant is perceived to be a gay man in El Salvador\". This finding contradicted the evidence provided by Mr. Amaya Jerez, whom the Board found to be a credible witness. He testified that the gang members made homophobic statements during both sexual assaults, accusing him of being gay because he served homosexual customers at his restaurant.",
    "[21]\nIn my view, the Board did not overlook this evidence. It concluded that the agents of alleged persecution knew that Mr. Amaya Jerez was not actually homosexual. They knew that he was married. The fact that he served homosexuals in his restaurant was an aggravating factor affecting the language and conduct they employed in expressing their threats. However, it was not the reason they were interested in Mr. Amaya Jerez or the real basis for their threats. The Board's conclusion that the real reason the gang pursued Mr. Amaya Jerez was because it wanted to sell drugs in his restaurant was not unreasonable on the evidence before it.\nV.\nIssue Two - Was the Board's decision unreasonable?",
    "[22]\nMr. Amaya Jerez submits that, because the Board ignored his evidence about his perceived sexual orientation, it incorrectly concluded that Mr. Amaya Jerez's evidence did not show a nexus to a Convention ground. Furthermore, he argues that the Minister erroneously suggested that because Mr. Amaya Jerez is married, he cannot be perceived to be a homosexual. Further, the Board's incorrect analytical framework is expressed in the last sentence of the decision, which states that \"[o]ne does not become gay as a result of being assaulted\".",
    "[23]\nAs I see it, the Board considered Mr. Amaya Jerez's claim that he had been persecuted based on perceived sexual orientation and implicitly acknowledged that the gang members could have had mixed motives. However, as discussed above, the Board took into account the evidence relating to this issue and concluded that the gang's motives were financial.",
    "[24]\nIt is certainly possible for a claimant to support a refugee claim based on imputed membership in a particular social group when he or she is not actually a member of that group. Here, the Board did not rule out that possibility. It simply concluded that Mr. Amaya Jerez was targeted not for his sexual orientation but for his ownership of a restaurant. Based on the evidence before it, I cannot conclude that its determination was unreasonable.",
    "[25]\nIn addition, Mr. Amaya Jerez submits that the Board incorrectly applied the law on generalized risk and overlooked his particular circumstances. He maintains that he was subjected to multiple incidents of sexualized violence because he was perceived to be homosexual.",
    "[26]\nHowever, the Board considered the evidence related to the allegedly imputed sexual orientation and concluded that Mr. Amaya Jerez was not targeted on that basis. Accordingly, he was not subjected to a personalized risk. Based on the evidence before it, the Board's conclusion was not unreasonable.\nVI.\nConclusion and Disposition",
    "[27]\nThe Board's decision was intelligible, justified and defensible based on the law and evidence before it. It was not unreasonable. Further, the Board did not ignore evidence regarding Mr. Amaya Jerez's alleged imputed sexual orientation. Accordingly, I must dismiss this application for judicial review. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[28]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;\n2. No question of general importance is stated.\nAppendix “A”\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\nRefugee Convention\n96.

Roberto Eduardo Amaya Jerez a quitté son Salvador natal et a fait une demande d'asile au Canada. Il allègue craindre les trafiquants de drogue qui ont tenté de l'obliger à vendre de la drogue dans le restaurant dont il était propriétaire à San Martin.\n[2]\nUn tribunal de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié a rejeté la demande de M. Amaya Jerez, concluant que sa crainte n'était pas liée à l'un des motifs reconnus dans la Convention sur les réfugiés et qu'il n'était pas exposé personnellement au risque de mauvais traitements. Il a été établi qu'il était plutôt exposé à un risque généralisé lié à la criminalité.\n[3]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez soutient que la Commission a commis des erreurs en tirant ces deux conclusions. Selon lui, la Commission n'a pas tenu compte des éléments de preuve démontrant qu'il était considéré comme un homosexuel et qu'il était persécuté, du moins en partie, pour ce motif. De plus, il soutient que la conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle il était exposé à un risque généralisé, et non à un risque auquel il était personnellement exposé, était déraisonnable vu la preuve soumise.\n[4]\nÀ mon avis, la Commission n'a pas ignoré des éléments de preuve importants. De plus, ses conclusions étaient raisonnables compte tenu de la preuve produite.\n[5]\nIl y a deux questions en litige:\ni. La Commission a-t-elle ignoré des éléments de preuve?\nii. La décision de la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?\nII.\nContexte factuel\n[6]\nEn 2003, M. Amaya Jerez et sa femme ont ouvert à San Martin un petit restaurant qui attirait une clientèle très diversifiée, comprenant notamment des homosexuels et des trafiquants de drogue locaux. Un de ces derniers, surnommé  El Chino Tres Colas , a tenté de convaincre M. Amaya Jerez de vendre de la drogue dans son restaurant, mais ce dernier a refusé.\n[7]\nEn 2004, deux associés de Chino Tres Colas, appelés  Cousin  et  El Tabatha , ont expliqué à M. Amaya Jerez qu'il allait devoir collaborer avec eux. Ils ont appuyé la pointe d'un fusil sur la tête de M. Amaya Jerez et ont menacé sa femme enceinte en pointant un fusil vers son ventre et son vagin. Monsieur Amaya Jerez a été battu. Au cours de l'agression, les membres du gang ont entré la pointe d'un fusil dans les sous-vêtements de M. Amaya Jerez et lui ont dit [traduction]  su tu laisses entrer les homos dans le restaurant, tu dois donc en être un toi-même .\n[8]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez a pris des dispositions pour envoyer sa femme dans une autre ville et il a fermé progressivement son commerce. Cousin et quatre autres membres du gang ont dit à M. Amaya Jerez qu'il ne pouvait refuser leur demande et qu'ils savaient où se trouvait sa femme. Ils ont battu M. Amaya Jerez, l'on soupçonné de nouveau d'être homosexuel et l'ont agressé en mettant le canon d'un fusil dans ses sous-vêtements.\n[9]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez a déclaré ne pas avoir porté plainte à la police parce qu'il avait vu des membres importants de la police, dont le chef de la police locale, fraterniser dans son restaurant avec les mêmes trafiquants de drogue qu'il craignait. Cependant, M. Amaya Jerez a eu besoin de soins médicaux et a été hospitalisé pendant trois jours. Son médecin généraliste a déclaré qu'il avait des blessures sur tout le corps, y compris une blessure à la tête qui avait exigé cinq points de suture, d'importantes meurtrissures et lacérations au dos et des marques d'agression sexuelle dans la région anale et génitale.\n[10]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez a fui San Martin et s'est installé à San Salvador avec son épouse, où il a trouvé un autre travail et a vécu dans cette ville jusqu'en juillet 2007; à cette date, toutes les personnes de son entourage voulaient de l'argent. Parmi eux se trouvait Cousin, qui a reconnu M. Amaya Jerez parce qu'il se rappelait l'avoir connu à San Martin.\n[11]\nCousin a volé le portefeuille et les clés de M. Amaya Jerez, lui a dit qu'il le tuerait s'il portait plainte à la police et lui a rappelé que Chino Tres Colas avait des comptes à régler avec lui. Monsieur Amaya Jerez et son épouse se sont installés dans une autre ville, Chalchuapa, et se cachaient chez eux lorsqu'ils ne travaillaient pas. Incapable de fonctionner de cette façon toute sa vie, il a décidé de quitter le pays.\n[12]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez a obtenu un visa de travail au Canada et y est arrivé en 2009. Après qu'il eut quitté le Salvador, sa femme a été accostée par les membres d'un gang qui ont tenté de kidnapper leur enfant. Elle a aussi été abordée par d'autres hommes qui lui ont demandé où se trouvait M. Amaya Jerez.\n[13]\nAu Canada, M. Amaya Jerez n'a jamais obtenu l'emploi qui lui avait été promis et il a été incapable de renouveler son permis de travail. Craignant de retourner au Salvador, il a présenté une demande d'asile en juin 2010.\nIII.\nLa décision de la Commission\n[14]\nLa Commission a estimé que M. Amaya Perez était un témoin sincère. De plus, son compte rendu des événements était conforme à la preuve documentaire selon laquelle le Salvador est aux prises avec un problème de criminalité extrêmement grave, qui comprend des tentatives d'extorsion et des actes violents commis par des trafiquants de drogue. De plus, la preuve documentaire a confirmé l'existence du trafiquant de drogue appelé Chino Tres Colas. Il s'agit d'un des chefs importants et en vue de Mara 18, une organisation connue qui se livre au trafic de la drogue et à la criminalité de rue. Selon certaines nouvelles, Chino Tres Colas a récemment fait l'objet de poursuites à cause des crimes violents qu'il a commis.\n[15]\nLa Commission a tenu compte de l'allégation de M. Amaya Jerez selon laquelle il avait fait l'objet de violences à caractère sexuel. Elle a conclu que ses allégations étaient pour l'essentiel fondées, mais elle a estimé qu'elles ne permettaient pas de fonder une demande sur les articles 96 ou 97 de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, L.C. 2001, c. 27 [LIPR] (voir les articles pertinents de la Loi en annexe).\n[16]\nPremièrement, il n'avait pas démontré l'existence d'un lien avec un des motifs de la Convention. Essentiellement, M. Amaya Jerez a été victime d'actes criminels, notamment d'extorsion; il a subi des pressions pour vendre de la drogue et il a été agressé par suite de son refus. Le traitement qu'il a subi n'était lié à aucun des motifs de persécution reconnus à l'article 96.\n[17]\nDeuxièmement, l'article 97 de la LIPR protège les personnes qui affrontent un risque auquel ne sont pas exposés de façon générale les autres citoyens du même pays. La Commission a souligné que M. Amaya Jerez avait certes été visé personnellement par les événements au Salvador, mais qu'il n'était pas exposé personnellement à des risques de mauvais traitements. Monsieur Amaya Jerez a attiré l'attention de Chino Tres Colas parce qu'il représentait une source potentielle de revenus. De plus, la preuve documentaire a confirmé qu'il existe au Salvador de nombreux membres de gangs qui pratiquent l'extorsion de façon généralisée. La Commission a conclu que toutes les personnes possédant des entreprises, des installations ou des actifs sont exposées à un risque généralisé.\n[18]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez a soutenu qu'il était exposé personnellement à un risque parce que les mauvais traitements qu'il avait subis résultaient en partie du fait qu'il était considéré comme un homosexuel. La Commission a exprimé son désaccord. Elle a conclu qu'aucun élément de preuve ne démontrait que le demandeur était considéré comme un homosexuel au Salvador. Les agents de persécution allégués savaient qu'il était un homme marié avec des enfants. De plus, en réponse à des questions à ce sujet, M. Amaya Jerez n'a pas dit qu'il se considérait comme un homosexuel. Selon la Commission, bien que les criminels qui ont agressé M. Amaya Jerez l'aient accusé d'être un homosexuel, ils ne l'ont pas fait parce qu'ils croyaient réellement qu'il était homosexuel.\n[19]\nPar conséquent, la Commission a établi que la preuve n'étayait pas l'existence d'une persécution du fait de l'orientation sexuelle. Elle a conclu que M. Amaya Jerez n'était ni une personne à protéger en vertu de l'article 97 de la LIPR, ni un réfugié au sens de la Convention en vertu de l'article 96.\nIV.\nPremière question en litige - La Commission a-t-elle ignoré des éléments de preuve?\n[20]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez soutient que la Commission a déclaré à tort que  [r]ien n'indique que le demandeur d'asile est perçu comme un homosexuel au Salvador . Cette conclusion contredit la preuve fournie par M. Amaya Jerez, lequel a été considéré par la Commission comme un témoin crédible. Il a déclaré que les membres du gang ont fait des déclarations homophobes au cours des deux agressions sexuelles, l'accusant d'être homosexuel parce qu'il servait des clients homosexuels dans son restaurant.\n[21]\nÀ mon avis, la Commission n'a pas ignoré cet élément de preuve. Elle a conclu que les agents de la persécution alléguée savaient que M. Amaya Jerez n'était pas vraiment un homosexuel. Ils savaient qu'il était marié. Le fait qu'il servait des clients homosexuels dans son restaurant ne faisait qu'empirer les excès de langage et les comportements menaçants des agresseurs. Cependant, ce n'est pas pour cette raison qu'ils s'intéressaient à M. Amaya Jerez et ce n'était pas non plus le fondement réel de leurs menaces. La conclusion de la Commission selon laquelle le gang s'attaquait en fait à M. Amaya Jerez parce qu'ils voulaient que le demandeur vende de la drogue dans son restaurant n'était pas déraisonnable vu la preuve qui lui était soumise.\nV.\nDeuxième question en litige - La décision de la Commission était-elle déraisonnable?\n[22]\nMonsieur Amaya Jerez soutient que la Commission a conclu à tort que le témoignage de M. Amaya Jerez n'établissait pas de lien avec un motif de la Convention parce qu'elle avait ignoré son témoignage au sujet de l'orientation sexuelle dont on l'accusait. De plus, il allègue que le ministre a affirmé à tort que M. Amaya Jerez ne peut être considéré comme un homosexuel étant donné qu'il est marié. De plus, la dernière phrase de la décision de la Commission exprime l'erreur qu'elle a commise dans son cadre analytique:  Une personne ne devient pas homosexuelle du fait qu'elle a été agressée. \n[23]\nÀ mon avis, la Commission a tenu compte de l'allégation de M. Amaya Jerez selon laquelle il avait été persécuté du fait de l'orientation sexuelle dont on l'accusait et elle a reconnu implicitement que les membres du gang ont pu avoir des motivations multiples. Cependant, comme il en a été question précédemment, la Commission a tenu compte de la preuve relative à cette question et a conclu que les motivations du gang étaient de nature pécuniaire.\n[24]\nUn demandeur peut certainement fonder sa demande d'asile sur son appartenance présumée à un groupe social particulier alors qu'il n'appartient pas vraiment à ce groupe. En l'espèce, la Commission n'a pas exclu cette possibilité. Elle a simplement conclu que M. Amaya Jerez était ciblé non pas à cause de son orientation sexuelle, mais parce qu'il était propriétaire d'un restaurant. Vu la preuve présentée à la Commission, je ne peux conclure que sa décision était déraisonnable.\n[25]\nDe plus, M. Amaya Jerez soutient que la Commission a appliqué de façon erronée le droit régissant le risque généralisé et a ignoré sa situation particulière. Il soutient qu'il a été soumis à de multiples incidents de violence à caractère sexuel parce qu'il était considéré comme un homosexuel.\n[26]\nCependant, la Commission a tenu compte de la preuve liée à l'orientation sexuelle qui aurait été reprochée au demandeur et a conclu que M. Amaya Jerez n'avait pas été ciblé pour cette raison. Par conséquent, il n'a pas été personnellement exposé à un risque. Compte tenu de la preuve dont la Commission était saisie, sa conclusion n'était pas déraisonnable.\nVI.\nConclusion et décision\n[27]\nCompte tenu du droit et de la preuve qui lui a été présentée, la décision de la Commission était compréhensible et justifiée. Elle n'était pas déraisonnable. De plus, la Commission n'a pas ignoré les éléments de preuve concernant l'orientation sexuelle qui aurait été reprochée à M. Amaya Jerez. Par conséquent, je dois rejeter la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire. Aucune question ne sera certifiée, les parties n'en ayant proposé aucune.\nJUGEMENT\n[28]\nLA COUR ORDONNE\n:\n1.

He claims to fear drug dealers who tried to force him to sell drugs in the restaurant he owned in the town of San Martin.\n\n[2]\nA panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed Mr. Amaya Jerez's claim, finding that his fear was not related to any ground recognized in the Refugee Convention, and that he was not subject to a personal risk of mistreatment. Rather, he was exposed to a generalized risk of crime.\n\n[3]\nMr. Amaya Jerez argues that the Board erred in both of its findings. He submits that the Board ignored evidence that he was perceived to be a gay man and was persecuted, at least in part, for that reason. Further, he contends that the Board's conclusion that he was exposed to a generalized risk, not a personal risk, was unreasonable on the evidence.\n\n[4]\nIn my view, the Board did not overlook significant evidence. In addition, its conclusions were reasonable on the evidence before it.\n\n[5]\nThere are two issues:\ni. Did the Board overlook evidence?\nii. Was the Board's decision unreasonable?\nII.\nFactual Background\n\n[6]\nIn 2003, Mr. Amaya Jerez and his wife opened a small restaurant in San Martin, which attracted a wide range of clientele including gay customers and local drug dealers. One of those drug dealers, a man called \"El Chino Tres Colas\", attempted to enlist Mr. Amaya Jerez to sell drugs in the restaurant. Mr. Amaya said no.\n\n[7]\nIn 2004, two of Chino Tres Colas' associates, known as \"Cousin\" and \"El Tabatha\", told Mr. Amaya Jerez that he would have to cooperate. They put a gun to Mr. Amaya Jerez's head and threatened his pregnant wife by pointing a gun at her belly and vagina. Mr. Amaya Jerez was beaten. During the assault, the gang members forced a gun into Mr. Amaya Jerez's underwear and said, \"[y]ou allow fags in the restaurant and therefore you must be one of them\".\n\n[8]\nMr. Amaya Jerez made arrangements to send his wife to another town and started to close his business. Cousin and four other gang members told Mr. Amaya Jerez that he was not allowed to refuse, and that they knew where his wife was. They beat Mr. Amaya Jerez, suggested again that he must be homosexual, and assaulted him by putting a gun in his underwear.\n\n[9]\nMr. Amaya Jerez did not make a police complaint because he had seen prominent police officers, including the local chief of police, socializing at his restaurant with the same drug dealers he feared. However, Mr. Amaya Jerez sought medical attention and was hospitalized for three days. His family physician stated that he had injuries all over his body, including a head wound that required five stitches, serious bruising and lacerations on his back, and signs of sexual abuse in the anal and genital region.\n\n[10]\nMr. Amaya Jerez fled San Martin and moved to San Salvador with his wife, obtained a new job, and was living there until July 2007, when he was surrounded by people asking for money. One of them was Cousin, who recognized Mr. Amaya Jerez from San Martin.\n\n[11]\nCousin stole Mr. Amaya Jerez's wallet and keys, told him he would kill him if he went to the police, and reminded him that there was unfinished business with Chino Tres Colas. Mr. Amaya Jerez and his wife moved to another city, Chalchuapa, and hid at home when they were not working. He felt he could not live that way forever, so he decided to leave the country.\n\n[12]\nMr. Amaya Jerez obtained a Canadian work visa and entered Canada in 2009. After he left El Salvador, his wife was approached by gang members who attempted to kidnap their child. She was also approached by other men who asked where Mr. Amaya Jerez was.\n\n[13]\nIn Canada, the job Mr. Amaya Jerez had been promised never materialized and he was unable to renew his work permit. Fearing a return to El Salvador, he made a refugee claim in June 2010.\nIII.\nThe Board's Decision\n\n[14]\nThe Board found Mr. Amaya Perez to be a truthful witness. Further, his account of events was consistent with the documentary evidence, which stated that El Salvador has an extremely serious crime problem, including extortion and violence by drug traffickers. Furthermore, the documentary evidence confirmed the existence of the drug dealer, Chino Tres Colas. He is a well-known, high-ranking leader of the Mara 18, an organization that is known for drug trafficking and committing street crimes. News reports stated that Chino Tres Colas has recently been prosecuted for his violent crimes.\n\n[15]\nThe Board noted Mr. Amaya Jerez's claim that he had been subject to sexual violence. While it concluded that his allegations were substantially true, it found that they did not support a claim under ss 96 or 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] (see Annex for statutory reference).\n\n[16]\nFirst, he had not shown a nexus to a Convention ground. In essence, Mr. Amaya Jerez was a victim of criminality, having been extorted and pressured to sell drugs, and attacked when he refused. This treatment had no connection to any of the grounds of persecution recognized in s 96.\n\n[17]\nSecond, s 97 of IRPA protects those facing a risk not faced generally by others in the country. The Board noted that, although Mr. Amaya Jerez had been personally affected by the events in El Salvador, he did not face a personalized risk of mistreatment. Mr. Amaya Jerez came to the attention of Chino Tres Colas because he was a potential source of revenue. Furthermore, the documentary evidence confirmed that there are many gang members active in El Salvador who extort money from the general population. The Board concluded that all people with businesses, facilities or assets faced a generalized risk.\n\n[18]\nMr. Amaya Jerez had argued that he faced a personalized risk because his mistreatment, in part, was based on the fact that he was perceived to be homosexual. The Board disagreed. It found no evidence that the claimant was perceived to be a gay man in El Salvador. The alleged agents of persecution knew he was a married man with children. Furthermore, when questioned, Mr. Amaya Jerez did not allege that he has any gay self-identity. The Board stated that, although the criminals who assaulted Mr. Amaya Jerez suggested he must be gay, they did not do so because they genuinely believed that he was homosexual.\n\n[19]\nAccordingly, the Board found that the issue of persecution on grounds of sexual orientation was not supported by the evidence. It found Mr. Amaya Jerez not to be a person in need of protection under s 97 of IRPA, nor a Convention refugee under s 96.\nIV.\nIssue One - Did the Board overlook evidence?\n\n[20]\nMr. Amaya Jerez submits the Board stated incorrectly that \"[t]here is no evidence the claimant is perceived to be a gay man in El Salvador\". This finding contradicted the evidence provided by Mr. Amaya Jerez, whom the Board found to be a credible witness. He testified that the gang members made homophobic statements during both sexual assaults, accusing him of being gay because he served homosexual customers at his restaurant.\n\n[21]\nIn my view, the Board did not overlook this evidence. It concluded that the agents of alleged persecution knew that Mr. Amaya Jerez was not actually homosexual. They knew that he was married. The fact that he served homosexuals in his restaurant was an aggravating factor affecting the language and conduct they employed in expressing their threats. However, it was not the reason they were interested in Mr. Amaya Jerez or the real basis for their threats. The Board's conclusion that the real reason the gang pursued Mr. Amaya Jerez was because it wanted to sell drugs in his restaurant was not unreasonable on the evidence before it.\nV.\nIssue Two - Was the Board's decision unreasonable?\n\n[22]\nMr. Amaya Jerez submits that, because the Board ignored his evidence about his perceived sexual orientation, it incorrectly concluded that Mr. Amaya Jerez's evidence did not show a nexus to a Convention ground. Furthermore, he argues that the Minister erroneously suggested that because Mr. Amaya Jerez is married, he cannot be perceived to be a homosexual. Further, the Board's incorrect analytical framework is expressed in the last sentence of the decision, which states that \"[o]ne does not become gay as a result of being assaulted\".\n\n[23]\nAs I see it, the Board considered Mr. Amaya Jerez's claim that he had been persecuted based on perceived sexual orientation and implicitly acknowledged that the gang members could have had mixed motives. However, as discussed above, the Board took into account the evidence relating to this issue and concluded that the gang's motives were financial.\n\n[24]\nIt is certainly possible for a claimant to support a refugee claim based on imputed membership in a particular social group when he or she is not actually a member of that group. Here, the Board did not rule out that possibility. It simply concluded that Mr. Amaya Jerez was targeted not for his sexual orientation but for his ownership of a restaurant. Based on the evidence before it, I cannot conclude that its determination was unreasonable.\n\n[25]\nIn addition, Mr. Amaya Jerez submits that the Board incorrectly applied the law on generalized risk and overlooked his particular circumstances. He maintains that he was subjected to multiple incidents of sexualized violence because he was perceived to be homosexual.\n\n[26]\nHowever, the Board considered the evidence related to the allegedly imputed sexual orientation and concluded that Mr. Amaya Jerez was not targeted on that basis. Accordingly, he was not subjected to a personalized risk. Based on the evidence before it, the Board's conclusion was not unreasonable.\nVI.\nConclusion and Disposition\n\n[27]\nThe Board's decision was intelligible, justified and defensible based on the law and evidence before it. It was not unreasonable. Further, the Board did not ignore evidence regarding Mr. Amaya Jerez's alleged imputed sexual orientation. Accordingly, I must dismiss this application for judicial review. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[28]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed;\n2. No question of general importance is stated.\nAppendix “A”\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\nRefugee Convention\n96.

      "The court found the Board did not overlook evidence regarding the homophobic statements made during the assaults, but rather reasonably interpreted them as an aggravating factor in a crime motivated by financial gain (extortion), not as evidence of persecution based on sexual orientation.",
      "The court upheld the Board’s finding that the applicant did not establish a nexus to a Convention ground under s. 96 of the IRPA, because the mistreatment stemmed from a desire to use his restaurant for drug sales, not from his perceived sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic.",
      "The court agreed with the Board that the applicant did not demonstrate a ‘personalized risk’ under s. 97 of the IRPA, as the threats and violence he experienced were consistent with the generalized risk faced by business owners in El Salvador due to gang activity and extortion, and were not specifically targeted at him due to a personal characteristic.",
      "The court determined the Board’s conclusion that the gang members’ statements about the applicant’s sexuality were not indicative of a genuine belief he was homosexual was a reasonable interpretation of the evidence, particularly given they knew he was married.",
      "The court found the Board’s decision was intelligible, justified, and defensible based on the law and evidence presented, and therefore not unreasonable, satisfying the standard of review for judicial review.",
      "The court explicitly rejected the argument that being assaulted with homophobic slurs automatically equates to persecution based on sexual orientation, deferring to the Board’s assessment of the gang’s primary motive as financial."
