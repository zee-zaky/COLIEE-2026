    "[1]\nO'Reilly, J.\n: In 2009, Mr. Sarabjit Singh Sekhon, a citizen of India, sought permanent residence in Canada as a skilled worker. He had been working at a school in Brampton teaching Punjabi on a temporary work permit, and had an offer for continued employment. An immigration officer in Buffalo concluded that Mr. Sekhon did not meet the required threshold of 67 points.",
    "[2]\nWhen the officer received Mr. Sekhon's application, she asked for additional information, including tax documents, financial statements for his employer, and pay slips. Mr. Sekhon supplied the requested information and an updated job offer. However, the officer was not satisfied that the offer was genuine or that Mr. Sekhon's employer was conducting business at the address provided. Mr. Sekhon then provided additional documents - letters from the employer, the employer's accountant and parents at the school, as well as some photographs. Still, the officer's concerns remained and she rejected his application.",
    "[3]\nMr. Sekhon argues that the officer treated him unfairly by relying on concerns she did not disclose to him. In addition, Mr. Sekhon submits that the officer's decision was unreasonable because she discounted the documents on which his application relied without justification.",
    "[4]\nI agree with Mr. Sekhon that he was treated unfairly in the circumstances and will grant his application for judicial review on that basis. I need not, therefore, consider whether the officer's decision was unreasonable.",
    "[5]\nAccordingly, the sole issue is whether Mr. Sekhon was treated unfairly.\nII.\nThe Officer's Decision",
    "[6]\nThe officer granted Mr. Sekhon points for his work experience, education and English language skills. However, the officer gave him no points for his arranged employment because she was not satisfied that his job offer was genuine. The employer's documents did not show Mr. Sekhon was on the payroll until October 2010, after he was asked to provide proof of employment. Further, his tax statement showed an annual income of $33,523, which amounted to an average of 24 hours a week - not a full-time work load.",
    "[7]\nAfter the officer raised these concerns, Mr. Sekhon provided documentary evidence showing that his income was reduced because of time off for illness and renovations at the school, and that payroll deductions had not been made for him because of an accounting error. He also provided corroborative letters from parents and photographs of the school.",
    "[8]\nHowever, the officer was not satisfied with this evidence. She concluded that the accountant's explanations were implausible, and that the evidence did not prove that parents had paid tuition or that students had received instruction in a real classroom. She noted that the school's address was in a residential neighbourhood.\nIII.\nDid the officer treat Mr. Sekhon unfairly?",
    "[9]\nThe Minister argues that the officer gave Mr. Sekhon a chance to respond to her concerns about the genuineness of his job offer. Accordingly, she treated him fairly. I disagree.",
    "[10]\nIn her correspondence with Mr. Sekhon, the officer stated that she was not satisfied that the offer of employment was genuine or that the school was actively conducting business at the address provided. Mr. Sekhon provided further documents but these did not satisfy the officer's concerns.",
    "[11]\nHowever, from the officer's notes, it appears that the officer had more specific concerns of which Mr. Sekhon would have been unaware. For example, the officer was sceptical about the location of the school and its ability to pay Mr. Sekhon's salary. She was also concerned about the school's late tax remittances, the lack of a business registration for the school, and the absence of a further updated job offer.",
    "[12]\nMr. Sekhon's submissions were directed to the officer's concerns about whether the school was carrying on business at the stated address. The parents' letters and photographs were aimed at meeting those concerns, and further documentation was provided regarding the school's finances. But Mr. Sekhon could not have met the officer's other unstated concerns because he was not made aware of them.",
    "[13]\nAccordingly, I find that Mr. Sekhon was not given a fair opportunity to meet the officer's concerns about the shortcomings of his application.\nIV.\nConclusion and Disposition",
    "[14]\nThe officer did not give Mr. Sekhon a chance to meet her real concerns about his application. Therefore, he was not treated fairly. Accordingly, I must allow this application for judicial review and order a reassessment of Mr. Sekhon's application by another officer. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[15]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed. The matter is referred back to another officer for a reassessment.\n2. No question of general importance is stated.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> O'Reilly\n[Translation]: In 2009, Mr. Sarabjit Singh Sekhon, a citizen of India, applied for permanent residence in Canada as a skilled worker. He was teaching Punjabi at a school in Brampton under a temporary work permit and was offered a permanent job. An immigration officer in Buffalo concluded that Mr. Sekhon did not obtain the minimum number of 67 points required. [2]\nWhen the officer received Mr. Sekhon's request, she requested additional information and documents, including tax documents, financial statements from Mr. Sekhon's employer and pay stubs. Mr. Sekhon provided the requested information and documents, as well as an updated job offer. However, the officer was not convinced that this was a genuine job offer or that Mr. Sekhon's employer was operating at the address provided. Mr. Sekhon then produced other documents: letters from his employer, his accountant and parents at the school, as well as photos. However, these documents did not allay the agent's doubts and she rejected the request. [3]\nMr. Sekhon claims the officer did not treat him fairly because her decision was based on concerns she had not discussed with him. He also claims that the officer's decision was unreasonable because she unnecessarily excluded documents on which his request was based. [4]\nI agree with Mr. Sekhon that he was not treated fairly in the circumstances and I will grant his application for judicial review for this reason. It is therefore not necessary for me to determine whether the officer's decision was unreasonable. [5]\nThe only issue in dispute is therefore whether Mr. Sekhon was treated unfairly.\nII.\nThe officer's decision [6]\nThe officer awarded points to Mr. Sekhon for his work experience, education and knowledge of English. However, she did not award him any points for his reserved employment since she was not convinced that the offer he had received was a real job offer. The employer's documents did not indicate that Mr. Sekhon was on payroll until October 2010, after he was asked for proof of employment. In addition, his tax statement showed an annual income of $33,523, which equated to approximately 24 hours of work per week - therefore a job that was not full-time. [7]\nAfter the officer raised these concerns with him, Mr. Sekhon produced documentary evidence showing that his income had been reduced because he had been on sick leave and because of renovations at the school. This evidence also revealed that withholding taxes had not been made in his case because of an accounting error. He also produced letters from parents and photos from the school corroborating his statements. [8]\nThis evidence, however, did not convince the officer, who concluded that the accountant's explanations were not plausible and that the evidence did not demonstrate that the parents had paid tuition fees or that the students had received instruction in a real classroom. She noted that the school's address was located in a residential area.\nIII.\nDid the officer treat Mr. Sekhon unfairly? [9]\nThe minister says the officer gave Mr. Sekhon the opportunity to address her concerns about the genuineness of the job offer. So she treated him fairly. I do not follow this opinion.

No question of general importance is stated.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O'Reilly\n[Traduction]: En 2009, M. Sarabjit Singh Sekhon, un citoyen de l'Inde, a demandé la résidence permanente au Canada en qualité de travailleur qualifié. Il enseignait le pendjabi dans une école de Brampton en vertu d'un permis de travail temporaire et un emploi permanent lui avait été offert. Une agente d'immigration de Buffalo a conclu que M. Sekhon n'obtenait pas le nombre minimal de 67 points requis.\n[2]\nLorsque l'agente a reçu la demande de M. Sekhon, elle a demandé des renseignements et des documents additionnels, notamment des documents fiscaux, des états financiers de l'employeur de M. Sekhon et des bordereaux de paie. M. Sekhon a fourni les renseignements et documents demandés, ainsi qu'une offre d'emploi à jour. L'agente n'était toutefois pas convaincue qu'il s'agissait d'une véritable offre d'emploi ou que l'employeur de M. Sekhon exerçait des activités à l'adresse fournie. M. Sekhon a alors produit d'autres documents: des lettres de son employeur, du comptable de celui-ci et de parents de l'école, ainsi que des photos. Ces documents n'ont toutefois pas apaisé les doutes de l'agente et elle a rejeté la demande.\n[3]\nM. Sekhon prétend que l'agente ne l'a pas traité équitablement parce que sa décision reposait sur des préoccupations dont elle ne lui avait pas parlé. Il prétend également que la décision de l'agente était déraisonnable parce qu'elle a écarté sans raison des documents sur lesquels sa demande était fondée.\n[4]\nJe conviens avec M. Sekhon qu'il n'a pas été traité équitablement dans les circonstances et je ferai droit à sa demande de contrôle judiciaire pour cette raison. Il n'est donc pas nécessaire que je détermine si la décision de l'agente était déraisonnable.\n[5]\nLa seule question en litige consiste donc à déterminer si M. Sekhon a été traité de manière inéquitable.\nII.\nLa décision de l'agente\n[6]\nL'agente a accordé des points à M. Sekhon pour son expérience de travail, ses études et sa connaissance de l'anglais. Par contre, elle ne lui a attribué aucun point pour son emploi réservé étant donné qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que l'offre qu'il avait reçue était une véritable offre d'emploi. Les documents de l'employeur n'indiquaient pas que M. Sekhon était inscrit sur la liste de paye jusqu'en octobre 2010, après qu'on lui eut demandé une preuve d'emploi. En outre, son relevé d'impôt faisait état d'un revenu annuel de 33 523 $, ce qui équivalait à 24 heures de travail par semaine environ - donc à un emploi qui n'était pas à temps plein.\n[7]\nAprès que l'agente lui eut fait part de ces préoccupations, M. Sekhon a produit une preuve documentaire démontrant que son revenu avait été réduit parce qu'il avait été en congé pour cause de maladie et en raison des rénovations effectuées à l'école. Cette preuve révélait également que des retenues à la source n'avaient pas été effectuées dans son cas à cause d'une erreur de comptabilité. Il a aussi produit des lettres de parents et des photos de l'école corroborant ses dires.\n[8]\nCes éléments de preuve n'ont toutefois pas convaincu l'agente, qui a conclu que les explications du comptable n'étaient pas plausibles et que la preuve ne démontrait pas que les parents avaient payé des droits de scolarité ou que les étudiants avaient reçu un enseignement dans une véritable salle de classe. Elle a fait remarquer que l'adresse de l'école était située dans un quartier résidentiel.\nIII.\nL'agente a-t-elle traité M. Sekhon de manière inéquitable?\n[9]\nLe ministre affirme que l'agente a donné à M. Sekhon la possibilité de répondre à ses préoccupations au sujet du caractère véritable de l'offre d'emploi. Elle l'a donc traité de manière équitable. Je ne suis pas cet avis.\n[10]\nDans sa correspondance avec M. Sekhon, l'agente a écrit qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que l'offre qu'il avait reçue était une véritable offre d'emploi ou que l'école exerçait ses activités à l'adresse fournie. M. Sekhon a produit des documents additionnels, qui n'ont toutefois pas répondu aux préoccupations de l'agente.\n[11]\nIl ressort cependant de ses notes que l'agente avait des préoccupations plus précises dont M. Sekhon n'aurait pas été informé. Par exemple, elle avait des doutes au sujet de l'emplacement de l'école et de la capacité de celle-ci de payer le salaire de M. Sekhon. Elle était également préoccupée par les remises tardives des taxes de l'école, par l'absence d'inscription de l'école au registre des entreprises et par l'absence d'une offre d'emploi plus à jour.\n[12]\nLes observations de M. Sekhon visaient à répondre aux préoccupations de l'agente concernant la question de savoir si l'école exerçait bien ses activités à l'adresse indiquée. Les lettres des parents et les photos devaient répondre à ces préoccupations et d'autres documents relatifs aux finances de l'école ont été produits. M. Sekhon n'aurait toutefois pas pu répondre aux autres préoccupations de l'agente puisqu'il ne les connaissait pas.\n[13]\nEn conséquence, j'estime que M. Sekhon n'a pas eu une possibilité raisonnable de répondre aux préoccupations de l'agente concernant les faiblesses de sa demande.\nIV.\nConclusion et décision\n[14]\nL'agente n'a pas donné à M. Sekhon la possibilité de répondre aux véritables préoccupations suscitées par sa demande. Il n'a donc pas été traité équitablement. En conséquence, je dois accueillir la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire et ordonner le réexamen de la demande de M. Sekhon par un autre agent. Aucune partie n'a proposé une question de portée générale à certifier et aucune n'est énoncée.\nJUGEMENT\n[15]\nLA COUR STATUE\n:\n1. La demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie. L'affaire est renvoyée à un autre agent pour réexamen.\n2. Aucune question de portée générale n'est énoncée.\n[End of document]",

    "factual_background": [
      "An individual, a citizen of India, applied for permanent residency in Canada as a skilled worker in 2009.",
      "The applicant had been employed as a Punjabi teacher at a school in Brampton, Ontario, under a temporary work permit.",
      "The applicant possessed a job offer for continued employment.",
      "An immigration officer initially determined the applicant did not meet the required point threshold for residency.",
      "The officer requested supporting documentation, including tax records, employer financial statements, and pay stubs.",
      "The applicant provided the requested documentation, including an updated job offer, letters from the employer, accountant, and school parents, and photographs.",
      "The officer remained unconvinced regarding the legitimacy of the job offer and the employer's operations.",
      "Specifically, the officer noted discrepancies in payroll records, the applicant's reported income (equivalent to part-time work), and the school's location in a residential area.",
      "The applicant provided further explanations regarding income reductions due to illness and renovations, accounting errors, and corroborating evidence from parents and photographs.",
      "The officer found the additional explanations and evidence unpersuasive.",
      "The officer expressed concerns about the school's tax remittances, lack of business registration, and the absence of a more recent job offer, but these concerns were not explicitly communicated to the applicant."
    ],
    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The immigration officer treated him unfairly by relying on concerns not disclosed to him.",
        "The officer's decision was unreasonable because she discounted documents supporting his application without justification.",
        "He provided additional documentation (letters from employer, accountant, parents, and photos) to address the officer's concerns.",
        "His income was reduced due to illness and school renovations, and payroll deductions were delayed due to an accounting error.",
        "The parents' letters and photographs were provided to demonstrate the school was operating and providing instruction.",
        "He was not given a fair opportunity to respond to all of the officer's concerns because some were unstated."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The officer gave Mr. Sekhon a chance to respond to her concerns about the genuineness of his job offer, therefore treating him fairly.",
        "The employer's documents showed Mr. Sekhon was not on payroll until after being asked for proof of employment.",
        "Mr. Sekhon's tax statement showed an income insufficient for full-time work (approximately 24 hours/week).",
        "The accountant's explanations were implausible.",
        "The evidence did not prove tuition payments or instruction in a real classroom.",
        "The school's location was in a residential neighbourhood."
      ]
    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The central finding was that the immigration officer treated Mr. Sekhon unfairly during the application process.",
      "The court reasoned that unfairness stemmed from the officer possessing unstated concerns about the application – specifically regarding the school’s location, ability to pay, late tax remittances, lack of business registration, and the absence of an updated job offer – that were not communicated to Mr. Sekhon.",
      "The court emphasized that Mr. Sekhon responded to the concerns *explicitly* raised by the officer, providing documentation addressing those points (school operation, tuition payments, classroom instruction). However, he was unable to address the unstated concerns because he was unaware of them.",
      "The court rejected the Minister’s argument that providing an opportunity to respond to stated concerns constituted fairness, clarifying that a fair process requires disclosure of *all* relevant concerns.",
      "The court did not rule on the reasonableness of the officer’s ultimate decision regarding the application’s merits, focusing solely on the procedural fairness issue.",
      "Based on the finding of unfairness, the court ordered a reassessment of Mr. Sekhon’s application by a different officer."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application for judicial review is allowed.",
      "The matter is referred back to another officer for a reassessment.",
      "No question of general importance is stated."
