    "[1]\nDubé, J.\n: The plaintiff (\"Feherguard\"), an Ontario company, is the owner of Canadian Patent Number 1123704 (\"the patent\") for an invention entitled \"POOL COVER ROLLER ASSEMBLY\" assigned to it by its inventors Wayne Guard and Tibor Feher on May 18, 1992. Feherguard commenced this action in infringement against the defendant (\"Rocky's\"), a North Vancouver company, on June 25, 1986.",
    "[2]\nIt is common ground that the patent generally relates to a telescoping roller for a pool cover, the roller having at least two tubes, which telescope together, each tube constructed so as to lock together upon rotation of one tube with respect to the other.\nConstruction Of The Patent",
    "[3]\nThe disclosure reveals that the invention relates to a device for use in removing, applying, and storing a swimming pool cover. Such covers are of the same dimension as the surface of the pool, comprise a single sheet of material sized for the pool and tend to be large, heavy, and awkward to remove. The invention provides a convenient and effort saving means for removing the cover. The device provides a roller usually as long as the largest width dimension of the cover. Each end of the roller is supported about the pool edge by a wheel or a pedestal, and an axle member connected to the roller. By simply rotating one of the axles using a crank and handle the cover is pulled off the pool and gathered in a roll on a roller.",
    "[4]\nIt is common ground that such rollers existed before the patent but they were of a standard size, not adjustable to all pools. Thus, the invented roller is a telescoping tube which permits adjustment of the apparatus to accommodate the various widths of different swimming pools. A telescoping tube of this kind must have some clearance between the outside diameter of the inner tube and the inside diameter of the outer tube to ensure that one will fit within the other given the tolerance that can be expected in manufacturing such tubing.",
    "[5]\nWhen two tubes are connected to form a telescoping tube and lifted into a horizontal position by its end, the telescoping tube sags in the middle. The very simple solution offered by the patent is to provide ribs along the inner wall of the outer tube and the outer wall of the inner tube. The two sections of tubing are then slipped one into the other with the ribs out of line with each other so that they fit beside each other. Once the appropriate length is obtained, the inner tube is turned within the outer tube so that the ribs mesh or lock up, thus providing a satisfactory alignment of the axes with the telescoping tube in a locked position.",
    "[6]\nFigure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a pool with a cover roller assembly supported on wheels, and the cover unreeled onto the pool water surface. Figure 2 is a view of one end of a preferred embodiment of the roller assembly illustrating the telescoping sections and the wheel attachment, crank attachment, wheel construction and wheel block.\n[See printed version]",
    "[7]\nThere are 20 claims in the patent but only the first one is in issue. It reads as follows:\n\"1. An apparatus adapted to be rested on a surface adjacent to a pool for use in removing and storing a swimming pool cover and the like, comprising:\n'a telescoping roller member having first and second ends which are telescopically separable to vary the distance between said roller member ends, said roller member having a first tubular section and at least one second tubular section, each section having an inside cylindrical surface and an outside cylindrical surface, said second tubular section adapted to be telescopically disposed from an end of said first tubular section, said tubular sections when so telescoped providing said first and second roller member ends, said first tubular section further defining a plurality of uniformly spaced ribs disposed from its inside cylindrical surface and extending longitudinally of the section from end to end thereof, said second tubular section further defining a plurality of similarly spaced ribs disposed from its outside cylindrical surface and extending longitudinally of each section from end to end thereof, the said ribs of said first tubular section engaging upon the said ribs of said second member when the said ribs of each section are aligned radially, thereby securing said tubular sections relative to each other;\n'support means positioned externally of the first and of the second ends of the roller member for mounting said roller member above the surface on which the apparatus is to be rested such that the pool cover can be wound onto the roller, and adapted to permit rotation of the roller;\n'means for securing an edge portion of the pool cover to the roller; and,\n'means positioned externally of said roller member to rotate said roller member for winding and unwinding said pool cover.'\"",
    "[8]\nThus, the first claim, which is the basis of the patent upon which the other claims rest, defines a telescoping roller member which consists of two tubes (or more) which telescope one into the other. Each tubular section is hollow and the inside surface forms a cylinder and the outside surface of each section also forms a cylinder. The first tube comprises a plurality of uniformly spaced ribs disposed from its inside cylindrical surface and extending longitudinally along the section. The second tube, or the inner section, also comprises a plurality of uniformed spaced ribs. Both sections are secured relative to the other and the ribs of each section are engaged together, that is, when they are aligned radially. It is to be noted that while the word \"ribs\" appears in claim 1, the word \"nibs\" appears in the disclosure.",
    "[9]\nIt is common ground that Rocky's product includes several of the elements outlined in claim 1. The points of contention involve the definition of the terms \"cylindrical surface\", \"ribs\", \"radical alignment\" and \"securing said tubular sections\".",
    "[10]\nThe terms \"cylindrical surface\" are significant because whereas the claim calls for tubular sections with an inside cylindrical surface and an outside cylindrical surface, Rocky's product comprises two tubular sections that are polygonal on the inside and the outside. On that score, I accept the opinion of Rocky's first expert, Ezra Timothy Peachey, a professional engineer, to the effect that \"tubing of twelve-sided polygonal cross-section is no more an adaptation of a round or cylindrical tube than is a tube of square cross-section\". Consequently, Feherguard cannot establish textual infringement in that respect and must rely on substantial infringement.",
    "[11]\nI also accept this expert's definition of the word \"rib\" as being \"a narrow structural member used to form, strengthen or shape something, typically extending perpendicularly to the surface being strengthened such as a rib of ship's hull, or a rib of an airplane's wing\". Feherguard will therefore have to show that Rocky's product does include a rib. In fact the defendant's product consists of nested twelve-sided polygonal shapes. In Mr. Peachey's view \"a vertex of a polygon could not, in my opinion, be considered a 'rib', nor could a flat wall surface be considered a 'rib'\".",
    "[12]\nClaim 1 stipulates that the ribs of each section must be aligned radially. According to the evidence of Mr. Peachey, when the vertices of the nested tubes of Rocky's product are aligned radially there can be no engagement of one vertex on another and therefore the two sections cannot be securely fixed in that position (unless they are bolted together).",
    "[13]\nThe fourth issue is the most crucial. On that score as well, I accept the opinion of Mr. Peachey that the person of average skill in the art would understand that the term \"thereby securing\" must be understood \"in the sense of fixing or locking\" and \"was also intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention\". Rocky's argument is that its product does not provide any locking, temporary or otherwise, but merely the holding of the two tubular sections together until they are bolted. It is to be noted that claim 1 does not refer to screws or bolts, whereas claim 16 refers to an apparatus \"further comprising a plurality of screws, whereby said tubular roller sections are further secured at a predetermined position\".\nInfringement Of The Patent",
    "[14]\nRocky's admits that it has manufactured and sold in Canada and exported to the United States a telescoping pool cover roller assembly comprising rigid telescoping tubes having a polygonal cross-section but denies that such polygonal cross-section provides inwardly and outwardly projecting rib-like areas extending longitudinally up the tubes. The original Rocky's roller product was first sold on October 30, 1985. At that time, it was installed by twisting the tubes until the corners of the inner tubes contacted the outer tubes, and drilling and screwing through the points of contact. It was found that this initial method did not work properly since the screws loosened and, six months or so later, the installation instructions were changed to provide for telescoping the tubes to the desired length and then drilling and bolting without twisting.",
    "[15]\nAdmittedly, there is no literal infringement on the part of Rocky's. Consequently, the burden is upon Feherguard to show that Rocky's is guilty of substantial infringement. In a nutshell, did Rocky's use other components to reproduce the invention? However, it must be borne in mind that the doctrine of equivalence only applies to nonessential elements of the claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (T.D.). The doctrine of equivalence in a mechanical invention also requires that the defendant's selection and arrangement of parts is substantially the same as the plaintiff's selection and arrangement of parts \"for it is in such selection and arrangement that the appellant's invention resides\", see Lord Evershed, M.R., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).",
    "[16]\nThe plaintiff's expert, Robert Courtney, the manager of an aluminum plant with much experience in aluminum dyes and extrusion techniques, opined that \"the twist and lock action of the inner and outer tubing is an essential feature of the invention of this combination. However, I do not think that it is material to the invention that the rib structures have any one particular shape\". He analyzed the defendant's tubing structure and found \"that it operates on the same principle as that described in the patent\". In his view, the polygonal structure of the tubing acts as a rib as \"the corners of the inner tube ride against the walls of the outer tube, thereby aligning the tubes and locking them in position for further fastening\". In his view, the word \"cylinder\" is not used in a geometric sense in the patent and it is immaterial in the operation of the invention that the tube be cylindrical. He also states that the word \"rib\" is not used to indicate a flat member perpendicular to another surface: \"it is also clear from the patent specification that the fundamental characteristic of a rib is that it has an inclined surface upon which an opposing rib may ride up or cam\". He concludes that \"the defendant's structure is a mechanical equivalent of the shape of the ribs in the patent\". However, Mr. Courtney admitted not being very familiar with patents.",
    "[17]\nAlthough I appreciate the long practical experience of Mr. Courtney in aluminum extrusion, I found that the impressive academic training of Mr. Peachey provided more knowledgeable answers to the particular mechanical engineering issues involved in this action. He was extremely well prepared. In his view, Rocky's swimming pool cover roller clearly does not include \"ribs\", as defined in claim 1 of the patent, under any meaningful definition of the term. A rib is a narrow structural member added to a surface. A rib is not the vertex of a polygon. Moreover, \"the person of average skill in the art would understand that strict compliance with the term 'rib' appearing in claim 1 was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention as claimed in claim 1 so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed\". It is also the view of Mr. Peachey, a view which I share, that \"the terms 'thereby securing' are used in the sense of fixing or locking [and] was also intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention\". The locking or fixing would be achieved by the engagement of the ribs alone and would not require further securing means. Whereas Rocky's product is of no utility unless and until the two telescopic sections are screwed or bolted together. According to this expert, the design reason for use of a polygonal cross-section in Rocky's system is that the polygonal cross-section achieves greater flexural rigidity between the two nested sections when the sections are secured by screws (as used by Rocky's for its earlier system) or locked by bolting (as for the subsequent system): \"there is a greater flat surface of contact between inner and outer sections when bolted than for round sections, and the flat surface is easier to drill into\".",
    "[18]\nThe defendant's second expert, Michael E. Jones, a metallurgical engineer and general manager of Alcan Extrusions, also testified that neither model can securely \"lock\" the two sections. They both merely \"interlock\" with hand twisting.",
    "[19]\nConsequently, I find that there is no infringement on the part of the defendant of the plaintiff's patent.\nValidity Of The Patent",
    "[20]\nIn its statement of defence Rocky's alleges that the patent is invalid on grounds of inutility, obviousness and ambiguity. The ground of obviousness was dropped at the opening of the trial.\na) Inutility",
    "[21]\nIn patent law, a patent is \"not useful\" if the invention will not work, either in the sense that it will not operate at all or, more broadly, that it will not do what the specification promises that it will do (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 203; 56 C.P.R.(2d) 145 at p. 160). A patent must be fairly construed. If the fair construction reveals that an essential element or, as in this case a limitation, has not been claimed, the omission is fatal (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 176 (F.C.A.)). If a material portion of the invention is useless, there is a failure of consideration and the patent is void (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[22]\nIn the case at bar, claim 1 promises that once the ribs of a tubular section are engaged upon the ribs of the other tubular section and the ribs are aligned radially, both telescoped sections will be secured. I accept that to mean that both sections will thus be locked and the roller will become useful in pulling the cover. However, the evidence in court has satisfied me that it cannot do so without the screws or the bolts. In particular, Mr. Peachey's oral testimony as well as his manual demonstration with plaintiff's product showed quite clearly that the two tubular sections in a \"locked\" position \"unlock\" easily with a light reverse manual twist. And the patent states that pool covers \"tend to be large, heavy and awkward to remove\". Without the screws or bolts, the roller is useless. But claim 1 is silent about screws and bolts and, thus, the patent is void.\nb) Ambiguity",
    "[23]\nA patent is presumed to be valid (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 350 (F.C.A.)). However, it may be declared void for ambiguity. The defendant's argument on that score is that the use of the word \"ribs\" in claim 1 and the use of the word \"nibs\" in the disclosure cause confusion. Counsel did not make much of that argument and neither do I. The interchangeable use of both words did not appear to confuse the expert nor anyone else. Consequently, I feel that ground has no merit.",
    "[24]\nConsequently, the action in infringement is dismissed, and claim 1 of the patent is hereby declared invalid and void. Costs to the defendant.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Gary W. McLaughlin/sms\n[End of document]"

Figure 2 is a view of one end of a preferred embodiment of the roller assembly illustrating the telescoping sections and the wheel attachment, crank attachment, wheel construction and wheel block.\n[See printed version]\n\n[7]\nThere are 20 claims in the patent but only the first one is in issue. It reads as follows:\n\"1. An apparatus adapted to be rested on a surface adjacent to a pool for use in removing and storing a swimming pool cover and the like, comprising:\n'a telescoping roller member having first and second ends which are telescopically separable to vary the distance between said roller member ends, said roller member having a first tubular section and at least one second tubular section, each section having an inside cylindrical surface and an outside cylindrical surface, said second tubular section adapted to be telescopically disposed from an end of said first tubular section, said tubular sections when so telescoped providing said first and second roller member ends, said first tubular section further defining a plurality of uniformly spaced ribs disposed from its inside cylindrical surface and extending longitudinally of the section from end to end thereof, said second tubular section further defining a plurality of similarly spaced ribs disposed from its outside cylindrical surface and extending longitudinally of each section from end to end thereof, the said ribs of said first tubular section engaging upon the said ribs of said second member when the said ribs of each section are aligned radially, thereby securing said tubular sections relative to each other;\n'support means positioned externally of the first and of the second ends of the roller member for mounting said roller member above the surface on which the apparatus is to be rested such that the pool cover can be wound onto the roller, and adapted to permit rotation of the roller;\n'means for securing an edge portion of the pool cover to the roller; and,\n'means positioned externally of said roller member to rotate said roller member for winding and unwinding said pool cover.'\"\n\n[8]\nThus, the first claim, which is the basis of the patent upon which the other claims rest, defines a telescoping roller member which consists of two tubes (or more) which telescope one into the other. Each tubular section is hollow and the inside surface forms a cylinder and the outside surface of each section also forms a cylinder. The first tube comprises a plurality of uniformly spaced ribs disposed from its inside cylindrical surface and extending longitudinally along the section. The second tube, or the inner section, also comprises a plurality of uniformed spaced ribs. Both sections are secured relative to the other and the ribs of each section are engaged together, that is, when they are aligned radially. It is to be noted that while the word \"ribs\" appears in claim 1, the word \"nibs\" appears in the disclosure.\n\n[9]\nIt is common ground that Rocky's product includes several of the elements outlined in claim 1. The points of contention involve the definition of the terms \"cylindrical surface\", \"ribs\", \"radical alignment\" and \"securing said tubular sections\".\n\n[10]\nThe terms \"cylindrical surface\" are significant because whereas the claim calls for tubular sections with an inside cylindrical surface and an outside cylindrical surface, Rocky's product comprises two tubular sections that are polygonal on the inside and the outside. On that score, I accept the opinion of Rocky's first expert, Ezra Timothy Peachey, a professional engineer, to the effect that \"tubing of twelve-sided polygonal cross-section is no more an adaptation of a round or cylindrical tube than is a tube of square cross-section\". Consequently, Feherguard cannot establish textual infringement in that respect and must rely on substantial infringement.\n\n[11]\nI also accept this expert's definition of the word \"rib\" as being \"a narrow structural member used to form, strengthen or shape something, typically extending perpendicularly to the surface being strengthened such as a rib of ship's hull, or a rib of an airplane's wing\". Feherguard will therefore have to show that Rocky's product does include a rib. In fact the defendant's product consists of nested twelve-sided polygonal shapes. In Mr. Peachey's view \"a vertex of a polygon could not, in my opinion, be considered a 'rib', nor could a flat wall surface be considered a 'rib'\".\n\n[12]\nClaim 1 stipulates that the ribs of each section must be aligned radially. According to the evidence of Mr. Peachey, when the vertices of the nested tubes of Rocky's product are aligned radially there can be no engagement of one vertex on another and therefore the two sections cannot be securely fixed in that position (unless they are bolted together).\n\n[13]\nThe fourth issue is the most crucial. On that score as well, I accept the opinion of Mr. Peachey that the person of average skill in the art would understand that the term \"thereby securing\" must be understood \"in the sense of fixing or locking\" and \"was also intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention\". Rocky's argument is that its product does not provide any locking, temporary or otherwise, but merely the holding of the two tubular sections together until they are bolted. It is to be noted that claim 1 does not refer to screws or bolts, whereas claim 16 refers to an apparatus \"further comprising a plurality of screws, whereby said tubular roller sections are further secured at a predetermined position\".\nInfringement Of The Patent\n\n[14]\nRocky's admits that it has manufactured and sold in Canada and exported to the United States a telescoping pool cover roller assembly comprising rigid telescoping tubes having a polygonal cross-section but denies that such polygonal cross-section provides inwardly and outwardly projecting rib-like areas extending longitudinally up the tubes. The original Rocky's roller product was first sold on October 30, 1985. At that time, it was installed by twisting the tubes until the corners of the inner tubes contacted the outer tubes, and drilling and screwing through the points of contact. It was found that this initial method did not work properly since the screws loosened and, six months or so later, the installation instructions were changed to provide for telescoping the tubes to the desired length and then drilling and bolting without twisting.\n\n[15]\nAdmittedly, there is no literal infringement on the part of Rocky's. Consequently, the burden is upon Feherguard to show that Rocky's is guilty of substantial infringement. In a nutshell, did Rocky's use other components to reproduce the invention? However, it must be borne in mind that the doctrine of equivalence only applies to nonessential elements of the claim.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ex. Ct.) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 1 (T.D.). The doctrine of equivalence in a mechanical invention also requires that the defendant's selection and arrangement of parts is substantially the same as the plaintiff's selection and arrangement of parts \"for it is in such selection and arrangement that the appellant's invention resides\", see Lord Evershed, M.R., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).\n\n[16]\nThe plaintiff's expert, Robert Courtney, the manager of an aluminum plant with much experience in aluminum dyes and extrusion techniques, opined that \"the twist and lock action of the inner and outer tubing is an essential feature of the invention of this combination. However, I do not think that it is material to the invention that the rib structures have any one particular shape\". He analyzed the defendant's tubing structure and found \"that it operates on the same principle as that described in the patent\". In his view, the polygonal structure of the tubing acts as a rib as \"the corners of the inner tube ride against the walls of the outer tube, thereby aligning the tubes and locking them in position for further fastening\". In his view, the word \"cylinder\" is not used in a geometric sense in the patent and it is immaterial in the operation of the invention that the tube be cylindrical. He also states that the word \"rib\" is not used to indicate a flat member perpendicular to another surface: \"it is also clear from the patent specification that the fundamental characteristic of a rib is that it has an inclined surface upon which an opposing rib may ride up or cam\". He concludes that \"the defendant's structure is a mechanical equivalent of the shape of the ribs in the patent\". However, Mr. Courtney admitted not being very familiar with patents.\n\n[17]\nAlthough I appreciate the long practical experience of Mr. Courtney in aluminum extrusion, I found that the impressive academic training of Mr. Peachey provided more knowledgeable answers to the particular mechanical engineering issues involved in this action. He was extremely well prepared. In his view, Rocky's swimming pool cover roller clearly does not include \"ribs\", as defined in claim 1 of the patent, under any meaningful definition of the term. A rib is a narrow structural member added to a surface. A rib is not the vertex of a polygon. Moreover, \"the person of average skill in the art would understand that strict compliance with the term 'rib' appearing in claim 1 was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention as claimed in claim 1 so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed\". It is also the view of Mr. Peachey, a view which I share, that \"the terms 'thereby securing' are used in the sense of fixing or locking [and] was also intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention\". The locking or fixing would be achieved by the engagement of the ribs alone and would not require further securing means. Whereas Rocky's product is of no utility unless and until the two telescopic sections are screwed or bolted together. According to this expert, the design reason for use of a polygonal cross-section in Rocky's system is that the polygonal cross-section achieves greater flexural rigidity between the two nested sections when the sections are secured by screws (as used by Rocky's for its earlier system) or locked by bolting (as for the subsequent system): \"there is a greater flat surface of contact between inner and outer sections when bolted than for round sections, and the flat surface is easier to drill into\".\n\n[18]\nThe defendant's second expert, Michael E. Jones, a metallurgical engineer and general manager of Alcan Extrusions, also testified that neither model can securely \"lock\" the two sections. They both merely \"interlock\" with hand twisting.\n\n[19]\nConsequently, I find that there is no infringement on the part of the defendant of the plaintiff's patent.\nValidity Of The Patent\n\n[20]\nIn its statement of defence Rocky's alleges that the patent is invalid on grounds of inutility, obviousness and ambiguity. The ground of obviousness was dropped at the opening of the trial.\na) Inutility\n\n[21]\nIn patent law, a patent is \"not useful\" if the invention will not work, either in the sense that it will not operate at all or, more broadly, that it will not do what the specification promises that it will do (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 203; 56 C.P.R.(2d) 145 at p. 160). A patent must be fairly construed. If the fair construction reveals that an essential element or, as in this case a limitation, has not been claimed, the omission is fatal (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 176 (F.C.A.)). If a material portion of the invention is useless, there is a failure of consideration and the patent is void (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[22]\nIn the case at bar, claim 1 promises that once the ribs of a tubular section are engaged upon the ribs of the other tubular section and the ribs are aligned radially, both telescoped sections will be secured. I accept that to mean that both sections will thus be locked and the roller will become useful in pulling the cover. However, the evidence in court has satisfied me that it cannot do so without the screws or the bolts. In particular, Mr. Peachey's oral testimony as well as his manual demonstration with plaintiff's product showed quite clearly that the two tubular sections in a \"locked\" position \"unlock\" easily with a light reverse manual twist. And the patent states that pool covers \"tend to be large, heavy and awkward to remove\". Without the screws or bolts, the roller is useless. But claim 1 is silent about screws and bolts and, thus, the patent is void.\nb) Ambiguity\n\n[23]\nA patent is presumed to be valid (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 350 (F.C.A.)). However, it may be declared void for ambiguity. The defendant's argument on that score is that the use of the word \"ribs\" in claim 1 and the use of the word \"nibs\" in the disclosure cause confusion. Counsel did not make much of that argument and neither do I. The interchangeable use of both words did not appear to confuse the expert nor anyone else. Consequently, I feel that ground has no merit.\n\n[24]\nConsequently, the action in infringement is dismissed, and claim 1 of the patent is hereby declared invalid and void. Costs to the defendant.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Gary W. McLaughlin/sms\n[End of document]",
