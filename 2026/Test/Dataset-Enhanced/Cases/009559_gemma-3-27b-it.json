    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (TD)\nMLB unedited judgment\nHanson International Inc. and Hanson Marketing Inc. (plaintiffs) and Whirley Industries Inc. and Greg Aucoin d.b.a. GT Sales (defendants)\nIndexed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )\nCounsel:\nHenry Lue and Jenna L. Wilson, for the plaintiffs;\nHélène D'Iorio, for the defendants.\nSolicitors of Record:\nDimock Stratton Clarizio, Toronto, Ontario, for the plaintiffs;\nGowling Lafleur Henderson, Montreal, Quebec, for the defendants.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.",
    "[1]\nMorneau, Prothonotary\n: This is a motion by the Defendants under Rules 208 and 221(1)(a), (b), (c) and (f) of the Federal Court Rules, 1998 (the Rules) in opposition to the Amended Statement of Claim filed by the Plaintiffs. At the hearing of the motion, I understood counsel for the Defendants to rely mainly on Rule 221.",
    "[2]\nIn the alternative to the striking out of the Plaintiffs' claim, the Defendants request that the Plaintiffs provide particulars of their claim and that the Defendants be granted an extension of time to serve and file their Statement of Defence.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe Plaintiffs served and filed an Amended Statement of Claim on Defendants Whirley Industries Inc. (hereinafter \"Whirley\") and Greg Aucoin, d.b.a. GT Sales (hereinafter \"Mr. Aucoin\"), alleging industrial design infringement and the procurement and inducement of industrial design infringement of Plaintiffs' Canadian Industrial Design No. 92298.\nThe Law on Striking Out",
    "[4]\nAs stated by Mr. Justice Décary in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pages 23-24:\nStatements of claim are struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action only in plain and obvious cases and where the court is satisfied that the case is beyond doubt (see Inuit Tapirisat of Canada and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R. (3d) 1, at 740 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.R.R. 287; 18 D.L.R. (4th) 481; 12 Admin. L.R. 16 and Hunt v. T & N plc et al., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 959; 117 N.R. 321; 4 C.C.L.T.(2d) 1; 43 C.P.C.(2d) 105; 49 B.C.L.R.(2d) 273; 74 D.L.R.(4th) 321). The burden is as stringent when the ground argued is that of abuse of process or that of pleadings being scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Pinard, J., and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 36 (T.D.) Gibson, J.). The words of Pratte, J. (as he then was), spoken in 1972,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Estate, supra, are still very much appropriate:\n\"... a presiding judge should not make such an order unless it be obvious that the plaintiff's action is so clearly futile that it has not the slightest chance of succeeding ...\"",
    "[5]\nThe Defendants seek to strike out the Amended Statement of Claim principally on the basis that it alleges no reasonable cause of action. In support of this argument, the Defendants have filed evidence in the form of two affidavits from Mr. Aucoin and Robert Sokolski, a representative of Whirley, in an attempt to demonstrate that sales of the Whirley DC32 bottle took place outside the jurisdiction of this Court.",
    "[6]\nIn his affidavit or further in cross-examination on said affidavit, the Defendant Aucoin admitted that he has contacted customers such as Petro-Canada to see if they were interested in \"acquiring\" the products of Whirley. He has also admitted that he \"facilitated\" in Canada the sale of the Whirley DC32 bottle, that he assisted Petro-Canada in filling out a purchase order listing form for the purchase of the Whirley DC32 bottle.",
    "[7]\nMr. Aucoin has shown catalogues depicting the Whirley DC32 bottle in Canada.",
    "[8]\nIn the course of its dealings with Whirley regarding the Whirley DC32 bottle, Petro-Canada communicated with Whirley through Mr. Aucoin.",
    "[9]\nAs to the Defendant Whirley, it has caused samples of the Whirley DC32 bottle to be shown to prospective Canadian customers in Canada.",
    "[10]\nWhirley has represented to the public that Mr. Aucoin is Whirley's sales representative in Canada.",
    "[11]\nWhirley features the Whirley DC32 bottle on a website, www.whirley.com, which is accessible by Canadians and contains content expressly directed to Canadians. Mr. Aucoin has admitted that he has seen this website.",
    "[12]\nWhirley has given credit to Canadian recipients for Whirley DC32 bottles damaged in shipment, despite Mr. Sokolski's claim that all sales of the bottles were FOB Pennsylvania.",
    "[13]\nIt would appear that both Whirley and Mr. Aucoin offered or exposed the Whirley DC32 bottle for sale in Canada, either through the provision of physical samples, sales catalogues, or website advertising.",
    "[14]\nSurely, the evidence regarding the transactions in question in this motion is contradictory. It is not by any means plain and obvious at this early stage in the proceedings that the Defendants have not offered or exposed for sale in Canada within the meaning of Section 11 of the Industrial Design Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-9, as amended. Section 11(1) reads as follows:\n11.(1) During the existence of an exclusive right, no person shall, without the licence of the proprietor of the design,\n(a) make, import for the purpose of trade or business, or sell, rent, or offer or expose for sale or rent, any article in respect of which the design is registered and to which the design or a design not differing substantially therefrom has been applied; or\n(b) do, in relation to a kit, anything specified in paragraph (a) that would constitute an infringement if done in relation to an article assembled from the kit.\n11.(1) Pendant l'existence du droit exclusif, il est interdit, sans l'autorisation du propriétaire du dessin:\na) de fabriquer, d'importer à des fins commerciales, ou de vendre, de louer ou d'offrir ou d'exposer en vue de la vente ou la location un objet pour lequel un dessin a été enregistré et auquel est appliqué le dessin ou un dessin ne différant pas de façon importante de celui-ci;\nb) d'effectuer l'une quelconque des opérations visées à l'alinéa a) dans la mesure où elle constituerait une violation si elle portait sur l'objet résultant de l'assemblage d'un prêt-à-monter.",
    "[15]\nAs well, it is not clear and obvious that title to the Whirley DC32 bottles was transferred outside Canada. From a reading of Exhibit 1 to the Affidavit of Mr. Sokolski, one cannot exclude the possibility that Whirley accepts responsibility for goods damaged in shipment. This could tend to establish that responsibility and title to the goods are transferred, not in Pennsylvania but in Canada.",
    "[16]\nAs for the action of inducing and procuring infringement, the Amended Statement of Claim alleges that the Defendants have induced and procured the offer for sale and sale in Canada of the Whirley DC32 bottle by Petro-Canada through its sale of the bottle to Petro-Canada, as Petro-Canada has sold the infringing bottle in Canada.",
    "[17]\nIn order \"to induce or procure another person to infringe an intellectual property right\", one must do something that leads that other person to infringe the intellectual property right, or must:\n(a) knowingly;\n(b) induce or procure (for example, by offering for sale, and knowing that their use by the purchaser would be an infringement);\n(c) another to infringe the intellectual property right.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 83 (Ex. Ct.).)",
    "[18]\nOn the contradictory evidence submitted so far, I cannot conclude that the Plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim is clearly lacking with regard to that offence.",
    "[19]\nFinally, the fact that paragraph 11 of the Plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim alleges that the Defendants have acted in concert does not seem contradictory to Section 11 of the Industrial Design Act although the said Act uses the expression \"no person shall\". By such wording, the Act does not preclude the possibility that more than one person could be involved in an infringing matter. A joint tortfeasor offence could be in play (see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 102).",
    "[20]\nFor the above reasons, I cannot conclude that the Plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim must fall under Rule 208 or any or all of the paragraphs of Rule 221 relied upon by the Defendants in the motion at bar.",
    "[21]\nHowever, as acknowledged by counsel for the Plaintiffs, paragraphs 11 to 14 of their Amended Statement of Claim need to be further and better particularized. Particularly, the Plaintiffs must allege and support by material facts the exposure for sale scenario if they intend to rely on it. All particulars shall be incorporated by the Plaintiffs in a Re-Amended Statement of Claim that the Plaintiffs shall serve and file within ten (10) days of the date of the accompanying order.",
    "[22]\nThe time under the Rules for the Defendants to serve and file their Statement of Defence shall start to run from the date of service of the Plaintiffs' Re-Amended Statement of Claim.",
    "[23]\nAs success is divided on the instant motion, no costs are awarded.\n[End of document]"

      "Applicants": [
        "The Defendants offered or exposed the Whirley DC32 bottle for sale in Canada through physical samples, sales catalogues, and website advertising.",
        "Mr. Aucoin contacted customers (like Petro-Canada) regarding Whirley products and facilitated sales in Canada.",
        "Whirley communicated with Petro-Canada through Mr. Aucoin regarding the DC32 bottle.",
        "Whirley represented Mr. Aucoin as its Canadian sales representative.",
        "Whirley’s website is accessible to Canadians and contains content directed towards them.",
        "Whirley provided credit for damaged bottles shipped to Canada, suggesting title transfer may occur in Canada.",
        "The Defendants induced and procured infringement by selling the bottle to Petro-Canada, who then sold the infringing bottle in Canada.",
        "The allegation that the Defendants acted in concert does not contradict the Industrial Design Act, and a joint tortfeasor offence could be applicable."

        "The Amended Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.",
        "Sales of the Whirley DC32 bottle took place outside the jurisdiction of the Court.",
        "All sales of the bottles were FOB Pennsylvania, meaning title and responsibility remained outside of Canada.",
        "Mr. Aucoin’s actions were limited to contacting potential customers and facilitating sales, not actual sales within Canada."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court denied the defendants’ motion to strike the plaintiffs’ amended statement of claim, finding that it did not meet the stringent threshold for dismissal as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The court emphasized that such motions are only granted in ‘plain and obvious’ cases where the claim has ‘not the slightest chance of succeeding.’",
      "The court found the evidence presented by the defendants regarding sales occurring outside of Canada to be contradictory. Specifically, evidence showed Mr. Aucoin actively soliciting Canadian customers, facilitating purchase orders, and displaying catalogues in Canada. This contradicted the defendants’ claim that all sales were FOB Pennsylvania.",
      "The court interpreted Section 11 of the Industrial Design Act, focusing on the elements of ‘offer or expose for sale’ in Canada. It determined that the evidence, including website accessibility, sample showings, and advertising, created a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendants had offered or exposed the product for sale within Canada.",
      "The court considered the issue of title transfer, noting that the evidence did not definitively establish that title passed outside of Canada. Whirley’s acceptance of responsibility for damaged goods in shipment suggested potential title transfer within Canada.",
      "Regarding the claim of inducing and procuring infringement, the court found that the evidence, while contradictory, did not allow it to conclude the claim was clearly lacking. It applied the legal test requiring a knowing act that leads another to infringe, stating it could not rule out this possibility at this stage.",
      "The court addressed the defendants’ argument that the use of “no person shall” in the Industrial Design Act precluded multiple actors. It reasoned that the wording did not preclude a joint tortfeasor offence and that the allegation of concerted action was not inherently contradictory to the Act.",
      "While denying the motion to strike, the court ordered the plaintiffs to provide further particulars regarding their claim of ‘exposure for sale,’ requiring them to allege and support this claim with material facts in a re-amended statement of claim. This was to clarify the basis of that specific aspect of their claim."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The motion to strike out the Plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim was denied.",
      "The Plaintiffs are directed to file a Re-Amended Statement of Claim within ten (10) days, further particularizing paragraphs 11 to 14.",
      "The time for the Defendants to serve and file their Statement of Defence shall commence upon service of the Plaintiffs' Re-Amended Statement of Claim.",
      "No costs were awarded."
