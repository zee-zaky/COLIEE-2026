    "[1]\nKelen, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence as a Québec investor on the grounds that the visa officer was not satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible to Canada. The applicant is a businessman in China, and the visa officer is based in Hong Kong.\nBackground\nThe applicant's application under the Quebec investor category",
    "[2]\nThe applicant, Mr. Wei Biao Chen, is a citizen and resident of China. In June 2002, he applied to the Province of Québec for a nomination under the Québec investor category. After attending an interview with the Service d'immigration du Québec (the Service), he received a letter from the Service advising that he did not meet the definition of the investor class under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n(the\nRegulations\n). The Service advised the applicant that the letter would be considered a refusal unless he submitting the following documentation to the Service within 60 days:\n\"An explanation from an accountant in relation to the amounts of 3.7 and 2.35 million RMB [renminbi] shown under 'Other Payables' and with respect to the revolving fund set up under the chengbao [sub-contract agreement] of 1996.\"\nThe applicant submitted the requested information and, on March 29, 2004, the province of Québec issued the applicant a selection certificate.",
    "[3]\nIn conjunction with his application for selection under the Quebec investor category, the applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada under the investor immigrant category. As part of his application, the applicant submitted material regarding his assets in order to prove that he legally obtained a net worth of at least $800,000 in accordance with the\nRegulations\n. This material included:\n1. a notarized \"CHENGBAO\" contract (sub-contract agreement) signed between the applicant and Guang Dong You He Trade with Taiwan Trading Company (the Trading Company);\n2. a translated copy of the 1996 purchase agreement for the sale of property located at 10th Street Clifford Estate (the Property);\n3. a receipt confirming the method, manner and amount of payment for the Property;\n4. the applicant's sworn statement regarding the source of his funds;\n5. submissions on behalf of the applicant dated March 30, 2005;\n6. various business contracts entered into by the applicant on behalf of the Trading Company;\n7. notarized corporate tax receipts;\n8. a tax certificate confirming the Trading Company's payments to the local tax bureau for the period from March 1996 to December 2002;\n9. bank statements for the Trading Company issued by the Bank of China for the period from 1999 to 2002;\n10. an audit report prepared for the Trading Company for the period from 1996 to 2002;\n11. a chart of the Trading Company's profits and losses for the period from 1996 to 2002; and\n12. the Trading Company's balance sheets for the period from 1996 to 2002.",
    "[4]\nThe applicant attended an interview with a visa officer from the Hong Kong Immigration Section of the Canadian Consulate General on November 17, 2005. By letter dated the next day, the visa officer refused the applicant's application for permanent residence. The letter stated in part:\n\"Subsections 34 to 42 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act 2001\nprescribe inadmissible classes of persons to Canada. In order for your application to succeed, you must satisfy me that you meet all the requirements of\nIRPA\nand the regulations, including a determination that you are not a member of an inadmissible class of persons described in subsections 34 to 42.\nYour failure to adequately account for the origins of your net worth makes it impossible for me to complete a comprehensive and proper assessment of admissibility in your case.\nSubsection 16(1) of the\nAct\nrequires that a person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonable requires.\nYou do not meet these requirements because you have not complied with my requests for evidence to satisfy me that your personal net worth was derived from legal and legitimate sources.\nSubsection 11(1) of the\nAct\nprovides that a foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this\nAct\n.\nBased on the information that is available,\nI am not satisfied that you are not inadmissible and that you meet the requirements of the\nAct\nfor the reasons explained above\n. I am therefore not authorized to issue you a permanent reside visa. Your application is therefore refused.\" (Emphasis added)",
    "[5]\nThe visa officer's concerns about the legality of the source of the applicant's funds are identified throughout the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes:\n1. The visa officer questioned the source of the applicant's funds with which he purchased the Property in 1996. The visa officer observed that the purchase price was RMB 509,652 and that the applicant earned RMB 421,400 from 1984 to 1996.\n2. According to the chengbao sub-contract agreement between the applicant and the Trading Company, the applicant bore responsibility for providing a revolving fund. The visa officer opined that the applicant could not have operated the chengbao without start-up funds.\n3. The applicant previously stated to the Bureau d'immigration du Québec that the revolving fund for the chengbao came from the applicant's own savings and from credit extended to him by a Hong Kong supplier.\n4. It was not feasible for the applicant to make a substantial payment towards the purchase price of the Property while operating a chengbao which required start-up funds.\n5. The purchase contracts submitted by the applicant did not contain accurate telephone numbers and listings for the contracting companies. In fact, three of these contracts were found by the respondent to be fraudulent.\nIssues",
    "[6]\nThis application for judicial review raises the following issues:\n1. Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?\n2. Did the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?\n3. Did the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?\nStandard of Review",
    "[7]\nThe case law is divided as to the appropriate standard of review applicable to visa officers' decisions. In some cases, the Court has determined that patent unreasonableness is the appropriate standard: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In others, the Court has applied a standard of reasonableness: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170. As stated by Linden, J.A., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\" 46 ... [T]he pragmatic and functional analysis must be undertaken anew by the reviewing Court with respect to each decision of an administrative decision-maker, not merely each general type of decision of a particular decision-maker under a particular provision.\"",
    "[8] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[9]\nHaving regard to the absence of a privative clause or absolute right of appeal, the availability of judicial review upon leave of the Court, a visa officer's relative expertise in assessing applications for permanent residence visas, the polycentric context within which decisions are made under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27, and the nature of the decision under review as a question of mixed fact and law, I conclude that the visa officer's decision on questions of fact is appropriately reviewed on a standard of patent unreasonableness.",
    "[10]\nWith respect to the issue of procedural fairness, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that questions of procedural fairness or natural justice are subject to the correctness standard:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 201, at paragraph 65. If a breach of the duty of fairness is found, the decision must be set aside: see, e.g.,\nCongrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 665. Questions of law like jurisdiction are also reviewed on a standard of correctness.\nRelevant Legislation",
    "[11]\nThe following legislation and inter-provincial agreements govern this application:\n1. the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the\nAct\n), the relevant excerpts of which are set out in Appendix \"A\" to these Reasons;\n2.\nAn Act Respecting Immigration to Québec\n,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the issuance of selection certificates to qualified immigrants wishing to settle in the Province of Québec. The relevant excerpts of this legislation are set out in Appendix \"B\" to these Reasons; and\n3. the\nCanada-Québec Accord Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens\n, dated February 5, 1991, which assigns responsibility for the selection of qualified immigrants to Québec. The relevant excerpts of this agreement are set out in Appendix \"C\" to these Reasons.\nAnalysis\nIssue No. 1\n: Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?",
    "[12]\nThe Hong Kong Immigration Section of the respondent conducted an investigation of the applicant's Hong Kong clients to confirm their business relationship with the applicant. The verification was specifically with respect to six contracts which the applicant had submitted to verify his business, source of funds and capital. The verification result was that three of the six contracts were flagged with a \"FRAUD\" warning. This verification report was completed on July 7, 2005.",
    "[13]\nOn cross-examination, the visa officer admitted that the fraud reports were not disclosed to the applicant prior to the interview on November 17, 2005, which was the day before the visa officer's decision. Moreover, it is clear that not all the fraud reports were discussed at the interview, the applicant was never shown the reports, and the applicant was not given even one day to respond to the verbal rendition by the visa officer of the \"verification results\" indicating \"fraud\".",
    "[14]\nThe duty to act fairly requires the visa officer to allow the applicant an opportunity to respond to any central concern, inconsistency or extrinsic evidence with respect to the application: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Pinard, J., at paragraph 15. The applicant was not given the opportunity to know that the verification result showed that three of six contracts investigated were found to be coloured with \"FRAUD\". The manner in which the visa officer raised this issue at the interview did not provide the applicant with a proper opportunity to know the case against him with respect to important extrinsic evidence against his application, or a proper opportunity to respond.",
    "[15]\nIn\nShi\n, above, Justice Snider considered a similar fact scenario at paragraphs 20 and 21 where the respondent sent a \"fairness letter\" to a Chinese applicant for immigration to Canada as an Investor in the Business Category selected by the Province of Québec:\n\" 20 In a fairness letter dated October 5, 2004, the visa officer advised Mr. Shi of the fraudulent certificate and allowed him 30 days to respond. The relevant portion of that letter reads as follows:\n'Following a review of your application for permanent residence in Canada, our office made telephone inquiries to verify tax documentation provided in support of your application. The verification uncovered serious discrepancies in the information submitted with your application and these call into question the authenticity of your accumulation of your personal net wealth.\nSpecifically, our office discovered that the tax document purported to be issued by the Shenyang Local Tax Bureau Helping Branch is fraudulent \nThe result of the verification suggests that you have submitted a false document. Misrepresentation such as this may result in the refusal of your application.'\n\" 21 In response to this letter, Mr. Shi denied that the certificate was not genuine and produced photo copies of tax receipts which, when added, corresponded to the 2000 total tax paid on the certificate in question.\"",
    "[16]\nIn the case at bar, the visa officer did not send Mr. Chen any \"fairness letter\" giving him knowledge of the findings of fraud against him, or a proper opportunity to respond. This is an obvious breach of the duty of fairness owed to the applicant, and warrants the intervention of the Court on this basis alone. For this reason, the Court will:\n1. allow this application;\n2. set aside the decision of the visa officer;\n3. expect Mr. Chen to respond to the results of the fraud verification report by sending the Hong Kong visa office more information to prove the legitimacy of those contracts and to better explain the legitimacy of his source of funds; and\n4. expect a different visa officer to then redetermine the application for a visa in a reasonably expeditious manner having regard to the delays experienced on this file.",
    "[17]\nAccordingly, the Court does not need to consider the other two issues raised by the applicant. However, in obiter, I will briefly express my opinion on these other two issues for the benefit of the parties.\nIssue No. 2:\nDid the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?",
    "[18]\nParagraph 9(1)(a) of the\nAct\nprovides that the applicant shall be granted permanent resident status because he met the Québec selection criteria as an investor immigration unless found inadmissible. The visa officer did not find the applicant inadmissible; rather, the visa officer said he could not be \"satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible\". This is not a finding that the applicant is inadmissible. If the visa officer concluded that Mr. Chen was not truthfully answering questions about his source of funds as required under s. 16 of the\nAct\n, the visa officer could have found Mr. Chen inadmissible under ss. 40 or 41 of the\nAct\n. He did not do so, and did not have the jurisdiction to deny a permanent resident visa to Mr. Chen under paragraph 9(1)(a) of the\nAct\n.\nIssue No. 3:\nDid the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?",
    "[19]\nThe visa officer clearly misunderstood the evidence before the Québec immigration officer and erroneously found that there was a contradiction in Mr. Chen's evidence about his initial working capital. Since the visa officer relied upon this misunderstanding to find that Mr. Chen could not have had the working capital in 1996 required under the chengbao contract or the capital to buy a house in 1996, this misunderstanding resulted in a patently unreasonable finding of fact.\nCosts",
    "[20]\nAt the hearing, the applicant sought for the first time legal costs under Rule 22 of the\nFederal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22.",
    "[21]\nThe Rule for immigration judicial review applications is that no costs shall be awarded to or against any party unless the court so orders for \"special reasons\". In this case, the respondent has acted in good faith without any undue delay. The applicant knew the legitimacy of his funds (C$800,000) was an important issue. The applicant should have presented his source of funds in a manner which clearly shows they are legitimate. The applicant did not do so, and now, as a result of his Federal Court case, he has a second chance. However, I do not think the respondent's conduct in this case constitutes special reasons for awarding costs.\nCertified Question",
    "[22]\nThe Court is satisfied that this case does not raise a serious issue of general importance which ought to be certified with respect to procedural fairness. The determinative issue concerning procedural fairness is obvious and not of general importance. The other two issues, being obiter, are not determinative.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[23]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed;\n2. The visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence is set aside and remitted for reconsideration by a different visa officer after the applicant has submitted additional information to respond to the results of the fraud verification and any other information which the applicant wishes to submit to verify the legitimacy of his funds (i.e. C$800,000).\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E. McKay/gs\nAppendix \"A\"\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection\nAct\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27\n\"Federal-provincial agreements\n\"8(1) The Minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, may enter into an agreement with the government of any province for the purposes of this Act.

A person is inadmissible for failing to comply with this Act\n(a) in the case of a foreign national, through an act or omission which contravenes, directly or indirectly, a provision of this Act; and\n(b) in the case of a permanent resident, through failing to comply with subsection 27(2) or s. 28.\"\n\"\nAccords fédéro-provinciaux\n\"8(1) Pour l'application de la présente loi, le ministre peut, avec l'agrément du gouverneur en conseil, conclure un accord avec une province; il publie chaque année la liste des accords en vigueur.\nConformité\n\"(2) Malgré les autres dispositions de la présente loi, doivent être conformes à l'accord:\na) la sélection et le parrainage des étrangers, ainsi que l'acquisition d'un statut, sous le régime de la présente loi;\nb) les règlements régissant ces matières, et notamment tout règlement concernant l'examen au Canada de certaines demandes pour devenir résident permanent ou concernant des étrangers dont la sélection est faite sur la base de placements au Canada.\nPrécision: interdictions de territoire\n\"(3) Le paragraphe (2) n'a toutefois pas pour effet de limiter l'application des dispositions de la présente loi visant les interdictions de territoire.\nResponsabilité provinciale exclusive : résidents permanents\n\"9(1) Lorsqu'une province a, sous le régime d'un accord, la responsabilité exclusive de sélection de l'étranger qui cherche à s'y établir comme résident permanent, les règles suivantes s'appliquent à celui-ci sauf stipulation contraire de l'accord:\na) le statut de résident permanent est octroyé à l'étranger qui répond aux critères de sélection de la province et n'est pas interdit de territoire;\nb) le statut de résident permanent ne peut être octroyé à l'étranger qui ne répond pas aux critères de sélection de la province;\nc) le statut de résident permanent ne peut être octroyé contrairement aux dispositions de la législation de la province régissant le nombre - qu'il s'agisse d'estimations ou de plafonds - des étrangers qui peuvent s'y établir comme résidents permanents, ainsi que leur répartition par catégorie;\nd) les conditions imposées à l'étranger, avant ou à l'octroi du statut de résident permanent, en vertu de la législation de la province ont le même effet que celles prévues sous le régime de la présente loi.\nVisa et documents\n\"11(1) L'étranger doit, préalablement à son entrée au Canada, demander à l'agent les visa et autres documents requis par règlement, lesquels sont délivrés sur preuve, à la suite d'un contrôle, qu'il n'est pas interdit de territoire et se conforme à la présente loi.\nCas de la demande parrainée\n\"(2) Ils ne peuvent être délivrés à l'étranger dont le répondant ne se conforme pas aux exigences applicables au parrainage.\n. . . . .\nInterprétation\n\"33.

À l'inverse, le ministre peut refuser de délivrer un tel certificat à celui qui satisfait aux conditions et critères de sélection s'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire que le ressortissant étranger n'a pas l'intention de s'établir au Québec, n'a que peu de possibilités de s'y établir avec succès ou dont l'établissement irait à l'encontre de l'intérêt public.\"\n2.\nRegulation respecting the selection of foreign nationals, c. I-0.2, r.5\n[as of March 29, 2004]\n\"\n2. Procedure for obtaining a selection and acceptance certificate\n2. The application for a selection certificate referred to in s. 3.1 of the Act is filed with the Minister by a foreign national for himself and for his family members whether or not they accompany him ; the application for a certificate of acceptance referred to in s. 3.2 of the Act is filed with the Minister by a foreign national for himself and for his accompanying family members.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the application for a selection certificate filed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in a class referred to in ss. 110 to 115 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations or in ss. 25 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act may not consider the foreign national's family members who are not in Canada, except if they are already covered by an undertaking subscribed to under s. 23.\nIt may also be made in their name by a person having the right to act on their behalf when the foreign national does not have the legal capacity to do so. Furthermore, in the case of a foreign national belonging to the class of independent immigrants, the application for a selection certificate is filed by the said foreign national, or if he so wishes, by his spouse or de facto spouse.\n3. Any foreign national wishing to settle permanently  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  must hold a selection certificate issued by the Minister under s. 3.1 of the Act.\nThe application shall be made on the form provided by the Minister.\n. . . . .\n6. The Minister decides to which class the foreign national applying for a selection certificate belongs.\n. . . . .\n8. Any foreign national belonging to the investors class shall be called for an interview, as well as any national in the class of persons in distress, excluding nationals referred to in paragraph a of s. 18 and, if a meeting is not possible while their records contain the information necessary for making a decision, nationals referred to in paragraphs b and c of that section.\nNationals referred to in s. 7 shall be called for an interview if they meet the requirements of the preliminary processing but fail to achieve the passing or cutoff scores, or whose application contains declarations the truthfulness of which is not demonstrated.\nThe notice of interview shall indicate the place and date of the interview and the documents that the national must submit in support of his application.\n9. The foreign national who makes an application for a selection certificate or certificate of acceptance must answer the questions of an immigration officer and produce the documents that the said officer demands for the purposes of determining whether he meets the requirements of this Regulation.\n10. The sponsor must answer the questions of an immigration officer and produce the documents that the said officer demands for the purposes of determining whether he meets the requirements of this Regulation.\n11. The foreign national or the sponsor must provide evidence of each fact submitted in support of his application for a selection certificate or certificate of acceptance or his application for an undertaking.\n. . . . .\n15. The foreign national is advised of the acceptance or the rejection of his application for a selection or acceptance certificate within a period of 60 days after the decision.\nThe selection certificate issued following the acceptance of the application is valid for 3 years from the date of its issue. Where a new selection certificate is issued immediately following the expiry of the previous selection certificate, it is valid for 12 months, if the conditions in effect at the time of the issue of the previous selection certificate continue to be met.\nThe certificate of acceptance of a foreign national coming to Québec to study is valid from the beginning of his studies for a period equal to the duration of the program or of the level of study referred to in s. 47. The certificate is valid for a period of not more than 36 months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a minor child, the period of validity of his certificate is the same as that of the certificate of acceptance or the work permit issued by the Canadian authorities to his father, mother or another person holding parental authority whom he accompanies, or, failing that, is 14 months.\nThe certificate of acceptance of a foreign national coming to Québec to work is valid from the beginning of his period of work for a period equal to the duration of an offer of employment that satisfies subsections 1 and 3 of s. 50. The certificate is issued for a duration of not more than 36 months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a foreign national who has an offer of employment in an occupation where the level of qualification for such an occupation within the meaning of the National Occupational Classification is less than B, the period of validity of his certificate is not more than, 14 months.\nThe certificate of acceptance issued to a foreign national coming to Québec to receive medical treatment is valid from the beginning of his medical treatment for the expected duration of the treatment.\nA selection certificate or a certificate of acceptance is valid until a foreign national is authorized to be present in Canada or to enter Canada under a temporary resident permit referred to in s. 24 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, even if the foreign national is inadmissible under the Act.\n. . . . .\n 3. Classes of foreign nationals wishing to settle permanently  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \n17. For the purposes of an application for a selection certificate, the foreign national who wishes to settle permanently  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  belongs to one of the 3 following classes:\n(a) class of foreign nationals who are in a particularly distressful situation;\n(b) family class; or\n(c) class of independent immigrants.\n. . . . .\n21. The class of independent immigrants includes a foreign national at least 18 years of age who: []\n(d) is designated as an investor if:\n(i) he has at least 3 years of experience in management:\n- in a farming, commercial or industrial business that is profitable and legal;\n- for a government or one of its departments or agencies;\n- for an international agency;\n(ii) he has net assets of at least 800 000 $ that he has accumulated through legal economic activities;\n(iii) he comes to settle and to invest  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation;\n. . . . .\n38. The Minister shall issue a selection certificate to a foreign national belonging to the class of independent immigrants if the foreign national is awarded, in the awarding of the points prescribed in the Regulation respecting weighting for his class in respect of the factors and criteria of the Selection Grid for Independent Immigrants in Schedule A, the number of points required as a cutoff score, where applicable, and as a passing score.\nFurthermore, an investor shall also file with the Minister a document proving that the amount mentioned in the investment agreement has been transferred to his broker or his trust company  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\"\n\"\n 2.

Le ressortissant étranger qui présente une demande de certificat de sélection ou de certificat d'acceptation doit répondre aux questions d'un fonctionnaire à l'immigration et produire les documents que ce fonctionnaire réclame aux fins d'établir qu'il répond aux exigences du présent règlement.\n10. Le garant doit répondre aux questions d'un fonctionnaire à l'immigration et produire les documents que ce fonctionnaire réclame aux fins d'établir qu'il répond aux exigences du présent règlement.\n11. Le ressortissant étranger, ou le garant, doit fournir la preuve de tout fait à l'appui de sa demande de certificat de sélection, de certificat d'acceptation ou de sa demande d'engagement.\n. . . . .\n15.

  "full_text": "[1]\nKelen, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence as a Québec investor on the grounds that the visa officer was not satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible to Canada. The applicant is a businessman in China, and the visa officer is based in Hong Kong.\nBackground\nThe applicant's application under the Quebec investor category\n[2]\nThe applicant, Mr. Wei Biao Chen, is a citizen and resident of China. In June 2002, he applied to the Province of Québec for a nomination under the Québec investor category. After attending an interview with the Service d'immigration du Québec (the Service), he received a letter from the Service advising that he did not meet the definition of the investor class under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n(the\nRegulations\n). The Service advised the applicant that the letter would be considered a refusal unless he submitting the following documentation to the Service within 60 days:\n\"An explanation from an accountant in relation to the amounts of 3.7 and 2.35 million RMB [renminbi] shown under 'Other Payables' and with respect to the revolving fund set up under the chengbao [sub-contract agreement] of 1996.\"\nThe applicant submitted the requested information and, on March 29, 2004, the province of Québec issued the applicant a selection certificate.\n[3]\nIn conjunction with his application for selection under the Quebec investor category, the applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada under the investor immigrant category. As part of his application, the applicant submitted material regarding his assets in order to prove that he legally obtained a net worth of at least $800,000 in accordance with the\nRegulations\n. This material included:\n1. a notarized \"CHENGBAO\" contract (sub-contract agreement) signed between the applicant and Guang Dong You He Trade with Taiwan Trading Company (the Trading Company);\n2. a translated copy of the 1996 purchase agreement for the sale of property located at 10th Street Clifford Estate (the Property);\n3. a receipt confirming the method, manner and amount of payment for the Property;\n4. the applicant's sworn statement regarding the source of his funds;\n5. submissions on behalf of the applicant dated March 30, 2005;\n6. various business contracts entered into by the applicant on behalf of the Trading Company;\n7. notarized corporate tax receipts;\n8. a tax certificate confirming the Trading Company's payments to the local tax bureau for the period from March 1996 to December 2002;\n9. bank statements for the Trading Company issued by the Bank of China for the period from 1999 to 2002;\n10. an audit report prepared for the Trading Company for the period from 1996 to 2002;\n11. a chart of the Trading Company's profits and losses for the period from 1996 to 2002; and\n12. the Trading Company's balance sheets for the period from 1996 to 2002.\n[4]\nThe applicant attended an interview with a visa officer from the Hong Kong Immigration Section of the Canadian Consulate General on November 17, 2005. By letter dated the next day, the visa officer refused the applicant's application for permanent residence. The letter stated in part:\n\"Subsections 34 to 42 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act 2001\nprescribe inadmissible classes of persons to Canada. In order for your application to succeed, you must satisfy me that you meet all the requirements of\nIRPA\nand the regulations, including a determination that you are not a member of an inadmissible class of persons described in subsections 34 to 42.\nYour failure to adequately account for the origins of your net worth makes it impossible for me to complete a comprehensive and proper assessment of admissibility in your case.\nSubsection 16(1) of the\nAct\nrequires that a person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonable requires.\nYou do not meet these requirements because you have not complied with my requests for evidence to satisfy me that your personal net worth was derived from legal and legitimate sources.\nSubsection 11(1) of the\nAct\nprovides that a foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this\nAct\n.\nBased on the information that is available,\nI am not satisfied that you are not inadmissible and that you meet the requirements of the\nAct\nfor the reasons explained above\n. I am therefore not authorized to issue you a permanent reside visa. Your application is therefore refused.\" (Emphasis added)\n[5]\nThe visa officer's concerns about the legality of the source of the applicant's funds are identified throughout the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes:\n1. The visa officer questioned the source of the applicant's funds with which he purchased the Property in 1996. The visa officer observed that the purchase price was RMB 509,652 and that the applicant earned RMB 421,400 from 1984 to 1996.\n2. According to the chengbao sub-contract agreement between the applicant and the Trading Company, the applicant bore responsibility for providing a revolving fund. The visa officer opined that the applicant could not have operated the chengbao without start-up funds.\n3. The applicant previously stated to the Bureau d'immigration du Québec that the revolving fund for the chengbao came from the applicant's own savings and from credit extended to him by a Hong Kong supplier.\n4. It was not feasible for the applicant to make a substantial payment towards the purchase price of the Property while operating a chengbao which required start-up funds.\n5. The purchase contracts submitted by the applicant did not contain accurate telephone numbers and listings for the contracting companies. In fact, three of these contracts were found by the respondent to be fraudulent.\nIssues\n[6]\nThis application for judicial review raises the following issues:\n1. Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?\n2. Did the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?\n3. Did the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?\nStandard of Review\n[7]\nThe case law is divided as to the appropriate standard of review applicable to visa officers' decisions. In some cases, the Court has determined that patent unreasonableness is the appropriate standard: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In others, the Court has applied a standard of reasonableness: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170. As stated by Linden, J.A., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\" 46 ... [T]he pragmatic and functional analysis must be undertaken anew by the reviewing Court with respect to each decision of an administrative decision-maker, not merely each general type of decision of a particular decision-maker under a particular provision.\"\n[9]\nHaving regard to the absence of a privative clause or absolute right of appeal, the availability of judicial review upon leave of the Court, a visa officer's relative expertise in assessing applications for permanent residence visas, the polycentric context within which decisions are made under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27, and the nature of the decision under review as a question of mixed fact and law, I conclude that the visa officer's decision on questions of fact is appropriately reviewed on a standard of patent unreasonableness.\n[10]\nWith respect to the issue of procedural fairness, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that questions of procedural fairness or natural justice are subject to the correctness standard:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 201, at paragraph 65. If a breach of the duty of fairness is found, the decision must be set aside: see, e.g.,\nCongrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 665. Questions of law like jurisdiction are also reviewed on a standard of correctness.\nRelevant Legislation\n[11]\nThe following legislation and inter-provincial agreements govern this application:\n1. the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the\nAct\n), the relevant excerpts of which are set out in Appendix \"A\" to these Reasons;\n2.\nAn Act Respecting Immigration to Québec\n,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the issuance of selection certificates to qualified immigrants wishing to settle in the Province of Québec. The relevant excerpts of this legislation are set out in Appendix \"B\" to these Reasons; and\n3. the\nCanada-Québec Accord Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens\n, dated February 5, 1991, which assigns responsibility for the selection of qualified immigrants to Québec. The relevant excerpts of this agreement are set out in Appendix \"C\" to these Reasons.\nAnalysis\nIssue No. 1\n: Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?\n[12]\nThe Hong Kong Immigration Section of the respondent conducted an investigation of the applicant's Hong Kong clients to confirm their business relationship with the applicant. The verification was specifically with respect to six contracts which the applicant had submitted to verify his business, source of funds and capital. The verification result was that three of the six contracts were flagged with a \"FRAUD\" warning. This verification report was completed on July 7, 2005.\n[13]\nOn cross-examination, the visa officer admitted that the fraud reports were not disclosed to the applicant prior to the interview on November 17, 2005, which was the day before the visa officer's decision. Moreover, it is clear that not all the fraud reports were discussed at the interview, the applicant was never shown the reports, and the applicant was not given even one day to respond to the verbal rendition by the visa officer of the \"verification results\" indicating \"fraud\".\n[14]\nThe duty to act fairly requires the visa officer to allow the applicant an opportunity to respond to any central concern, inconsistency or extrinsic evidence with respect to the application: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Pinard, J., at paragraph 15. The applicant was not given the opportunity to know that the verification result showed that three of six contracts investigated were found to be coloured with \"FRAUD\". The manner in which the visa officer raised this issue at the interview did not provide the applicant with a proper opportunity to know the case against him with respect to important extrinsic evidence against his application, or a proper opportunity to respond.\n[15]\nIn\nShi\n, above, Justice Snider considered a similar fact scenario at paragraphs 20 and 21 where the respondent sent a \"fairness letter\" to a Chinese applicant for immigration to Canada as an Investor in the Business Category selected by the Province of Québec:\n\" 20 In a fairness letter dated October 5, 2004, the visa officer advised Mr. Shi of the fraudulent certificate and allowed him 30 days to respond. The relevant portion of that letter reads as follows:\n'Following a review of your application for permanent residence in Canada, our office made telephone inquiries to verify tax documentation provided in support of your application. The verification uncovered serious discrepancies in the information submitted with your application and these call into question the authenticity of your accumulation of your personal net wealth.\nSpecifically, our office discovered that the tax document purported to be issued by the Shenyang Local Tax Bureau Helping Branch is fraudulent \nThe result of the verification suggests that you have submitted a false document. Misrepresentation such as this may result in the refusal of your application.'\n\" 21 In response to this letter, Mr. Shi denied that the certificate was not genuine and produced photo copies of tax receipts which, when added, corresponded to the 2000 total tax paid on the certificate in question.\"\n[16]\nIn the case at bar, the visa officer did not send Mr. Chen any \"fairness letter\" giving him knowledge of the findings of fraud against him, or a proper opportunity to respond. This is an obvious breach of the duty of fairness owed to the applicant, and warrants the intervention of the Court on this basis alone. For this reason, the Court will:\n1. allow this application;\n2. set aside the decision of the visa officer;\n3. expect Mr. Chen to respond to the results of the fraud verification report by sending the Hong Kong visa office more information to prove the legitimacy of those contracts and to better explain the legitimacy of his source of funds; and\n4. expect a different visa officer to then redetermine the application for a visa in a reasonably expeditious manner having regard to the delays experienced on this file.\n[17]\nAccordingly, the Court does not need to consider the other two issues raised by the applicant. However, in obiter, I will briefly express my opinion on these other two issues for the benefit of the parties.\nIssue No. 2:\nDid the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?\n[18]\nParagraph 9(1)(a) of the\nAct\nprovides that the applicant shall be granted permanent resident status because he met the Québec selection criteria as an investor immigration unless found inadmissible. The visa officer did not find the applicant inadmissible; rather, the visa officer said he could not be \"satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible\". This is not a finding that the applicant is inadmissible. If the visa officer concluded that Mr. Chen was not truthfully answering questions about his source of funds as required under s. 16 of the\nAct\n, the visa officer could have found Mr. Chen inadmissible under ss. 40 or 41 of the\nAct\n. He did not do so, and did not have the jurisdiction to deny a permanent resident visa to Mr. Chen under paragraph 9(1)(a) of the\nAct\n.\nIssue No. 3:\nDid the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?\n[19]\nThe visa officer clearly misunderstood the evidence before the Québec immigration officer and erroneously found that there was a contradiction in Mr. Chen's evidence about his initial working capital. Since the visa officer relied upon this misunderstanding to find that Mr. Chen could not have had the working capital in 1996 required under the chengbao contract or the capital to buy a house in 1996, this misunderstanding resulted in a patently unreasonable finding of fact.\nCosts\n[20]\nAt the hearing, the applicant sought for the first time legal costs under Rule 22 of the\nFederal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22.\n[21]\nThe Rule for immigration judicial review applications is that no costs shall be awarded to or against any party unless the court so orders for \"special reasons\". In this case, the respondent has acted in good faith without any undue delay. The applicant knew the legitimacy of his funds (C$800,000) was an important issue. The applicant should have presented his source of funds in a manner which clearly shows they are legitimate. The applicant did not do so, and now, as a result of his Federal Court case, he has a second chance. However, I do not think the respondent's conduct in this case constitutes special reasons for awarding costs.\nCertified Question\n[22]\nThe Court is satisfied that this case does not raise a serious issue of general importance which ought to be certified with respect to procedural fairness. The determinative issue concerning procedural fairness is obvious and not of general importance. The other two issues, being obiter, are not determinative.\nJUDGMENT\n[23]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed;\n2.

The Minister may, for or within a class, suspend the examination of applications or cease to issue selection certificates until the beginning of the following calendar year if the Minister considers that the maximum number or estimate set out in the annual plan will be reached.\nSelection certificate.\nNotwithstanding the third or fourth paragraph, the Minister may, in accordance with the regulations, issue a selection certificate to a foreign national in a particularly distressful situation, in particular, in the case of Convention refugees as defined in the\nImmigration Act\n(Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, chapter I-2), or in any other case where the Minister considers that the results obtained following the application of the selection criteria do not reflect whether or not the foreign national will be able to become successfully established  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Conversely, the Minister may refuse to issue such a certificate to a foreign national who meets the conditions and criteria of selection if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national does not intend to settle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or is unlikely to settle successfully  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or that the settlement of the foreign national would be contrary to public interest.\"\n\"\nRessortissant étranger permanent.\n3.1.

The applicant is a businessman in China, and the visa officer is based in Hong Kong.\nBackground\nThe applicant's application under the Quebec investor category\n\n[2]\nThe applicant, Mr. Wei Biao Chen, is a citizen and resident of China. In June 2002, he applied to the Province of Québec for a nomination under the Québec investor category. After attending an interview with the Service d'immigration du Québec (the Service), he received a letter from the Service advising that he did not meet the definition of the investor class under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n(the\nRegulations\n). The Service advised the applicant that the letter would be considered a refusal unless he submitting the following documentation to the Service within 60 days:\n\"An explanation from an accountant in relation to the amounts of 3.7 and 2.35 million RMB [renminbi] shown under 'Other Payables' and with respect to the revolving fund set up under the chengbao [sub-contract agreement] of 1996.\"\nThe applicant submitted the requested information and, on March 29, 2004, the province of Québec issued the applicant a selection certificate.\n\n[3]\nIn conjunction with his application for selection under the Quebec investor category, the applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada under the investor immigrant category. As part of his application, the applicant submitted material regarding his assets in order to prove that he legally obtained a net worth of at least $800,000 in accordance with the\nRegulations\n. This material included:\n1. a notarized \"CHENGBAO\" contract (sub-contract agreement) signed between the applicant and Guang Dong You He Trade with Taiwan Trading Company (the Trading Company);\n2. a translated copy of the 1996 purchase agreement for the sale of property located at 10th Street Clifford Estate (the Property);\n3. a receipt confirming the method, manner and amount of payment for the Property;\n4. the applicant's sworn statement regarding the source of his funds;\n5. submissions on behalf of the applicant dated March 30, 2005;\n6. various business contracts entered into by the applicant on behalf of the Trading Company;\n7. notarized corporate tax receipts;\n8. a tax certificate confirming the Trading Company's payments to the local tax bureau for the period from March 1996 to December 2002;\n9. bank statements for the Trading Company issued by the Bank of China for the period from 1999 to 2002;\n10. an audit report prepared for the Trading Company for the period from 1996 to 2002;\n11. a chart of the Trading Company's profits and losses for the period from 1996 to 2002; and\n12. the Trading Company's balance sheets for the period from 1996 to 2002.\n\n[4]\nThe applicant attended an interview with a visa officer from the Hong Kong Immigration Section of the Canadian Consulate General on November 17, 2005. By letter dated the next day, the visa officer refused the applicant's application for permanent residence. The letter stated in part:\n\"Subsections 34 to 42 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act 2001\nprescribe inadmissible classes of persons to Canada. In order for your application to succeed, you must satisfy me that you meet all the requirements of\nIRPA\nand the regulations, including a determination that you are not a member of an inadmissible class of persons described in subsections 34 to 42.\nYour failure to adequately account for the origins of your net worth makes it impossible for me to complete a comprehensive and proper assessment of admissibility in your case.\nSubsection 16(1) of the\nAct\nrequires that a person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of the examination and must produce all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonable requires.\nYou do not meet these requirements because you have not complied with my requests for evidence to satisfy me that your personal net worth was derived from legal and legitimate sources.\nSubsection 11(1) of the\nAct\nprovides that a foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this\nAct\n.\nBased on the information that is available,\nI am not satisfied that you are not inadmissible and that you meet the requirements of the\nAct\nfor the reasons explained above\n. I am therefore not authorized to issue you a permanent reside visa. Your application is therefore refused.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n[5]\nThe visa officer's concerns about the legality of the source of the applicant's funds are identified throughout the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes:\n1. The visa officer questioned the source of the applicant's funds with which he purchased the Property in 1996. The visa officer observed that the purchase price was RMB 509,652 and that the applicant earned RMB 421,400 from 1984 to 1996.\n2. According to the chengbao sub-contract agreement between the applicant and the Trading Company, the applicant bore responsibility for providing a revolving fund. The visa officer opined that the applicant could not have operated the chengbao without start-up funds.\n3. The applicant previously stated to the Bureau d'immigration du Québec that the revolving fund for the chengbao came from the applicant's own savings and from credit extended to him by a Hong Kong supplier.\n4. It was not feasible for the applicant to make a substantial payment towards the purchase price of the Property while operating a chengbao which required start-up funds.\n5. The purchase contracts submitted by the applicant did not contain accurate telephone numbers and listings for the contracting companies. In fact, three of these contracts were found by the respondent to be fraudulent.\nIssues\n\n[6]\nThis application for judicial review raises the following issues:\n1. Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?\n2. Did the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?\n3. Did the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?\nStandard of Review\n\n[7]\nThe case law is divided as to the appropriate standard of review applicable to visa officers' decisions. In some cases, the Court has determined that patent unreasonableness is the appropriate standard: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In others, the Court has applied a standard of reasonableness: see, e.g.,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170. As stated by Linden, J.A., in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n\" 46 ... [T]he pragmatic and functional analysis must be undertaken anew by the reviewing Court with respect to each decision of an administrative decision-maker, not merely each general type of decision of a particular decision-maker under a particular provision.\"\n\n[8] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[9]\nHaving regard to the absence of a privative clause or absolute right of appeal, the availability of judicial review upon leave of the Court, a visa officer's relative expertise in assessing applications for permanent residence visas, the polycentric context within which decisions are made under the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27, and the nature of the decision under review as a question of mixed fact and law, I conclude that the visa officer's decision on questions of fact is appropriately reviewed on a standard of patent unreasonableness.\n\n[10]\nWith respect to the issue of procedural fairness, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that questions of procedural fairness or natural justice are subject to the correctness standard:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 201, at paragraph 65. If a breach of the duty of fairness is found, the decision must be set aside: see, e.g.,\nCongrégation des témoins de  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 665. Questions of law like jurisdiction are also reviewed on a standard of correctness.\nRelevant Legislation\n\n[11]\nThe following legislation and inter-provincial agreements govern this application:\n1. the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the\nAct\n), the relevant excerpts of which are set out in Appendix \"A\" to these Reasons;\n2.\nAn Act Respecting Immigration to Québec\n,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for the issuance of selection certificates to qualified immigrants wishing to settle in the Province of Québec. The relevant excerpts of this legislation are set out in Appendix \"B\" to these Reasons; and\n3. the\nCanada-Québec Accord Relating to Immigration and Temporary Admission of Aliens\n, dated February 5, 1991, which assigns responsibility for the selection of qualified immigrants to Québec. The relevant excerpts of this agreement are set out in Appendix \"C\" to these Reasons.\nAnalysis\nIssue No. 1\n: Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by denying the applicant an opportunity to know and respond to the case against him?\n\n[12]\nThe Hong Kong Immigration Section of the respondent conducted an investigation of the applicant's Hong Kong clients to confirm their business relationship with the applicant. The verification was specifically with respect to six contracts which the applicant had submitted to verify his business, source of funds and capital. The verification result was that three of the six contracts were flagged with a \"FRAUD\" warning. This verification report was completed on July 7, 2005.\n\n[13]\nOn cross-examination, the visa officer admitted that the fraud reports were not disclosed to the applicant prior to the interview on November 17, 2005, which was the day before the visa officer's decision. Moreover, it is clear that not all the fraud reports were discussed at the interview, the applicant was never shown the reports, and the applicant was not given even one day to respond to the verbal rendition by the visa officer of the \"verification results\" indicating \"fraud\".\n\n[14]\nThe duty to act fairly requires the visa officer to allow the applicant an opportunity to respond to any central concern, inconsistency or extrinsic evidence with respect to the application: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Pinard, J., at paragraph 15. The applicant was not given the opportunity to know that the verification result showed that three of six contracts investigated were found to be coloured with \"FRAUD\". The manner in which the visa officer raised this issue at the interview did not provide the applicant with a proper opportunity to know the case against him with respect to important extrinsic evidence against his application, or a proper opportunity to respond.\n\n[15]\nIn\nShi\n, above, Justice Snider considered a similar fact scenario at paragraphs 20 and 21 where the respondent sent a \"fairness letter\" to a Chinese applicant for immigration to Canada as an Investor in the Business Category selected by the Province of Québec:\n\" 20 In a fairness letter dated October 5, 2004, the visa officer advised Mr. Shi of the fraudulent certificate and allowed him 30 days to respond. The relevant portion of that letter reads as follows:\n'Following a review of your application for permanent residence in Canada, our office made telephone inquiries to verify tax documentation provided in support of your application. The verification uncovered serious discrepancies in the information submitted with your application and these call into question the authenticity of your accumulation of your personal net wealth.\nSpecifically, our office discovered that the tax document purported to be issued by the Shenyang Local Tax Bureau Helping Branch is fraudulent \nThe result of the verification suggests that you have submitted a false document. Misrepresentation such as this may result in the refusal of your application.'\n\" 21 In response to this letter, Mr. Shi denied that the certificate was not genuine and produced photo copies of tax receipts which, when added, corresponded to the 2000 total tax paid on the certificate in question.\"\n\n[16]\nIn the case at bar, the visa officer did not send Mr. Chen any \"fairness letter\" giving him knowledge of the findings of fraud against him, or a proper opportunity to respond. This is an obvious breach of the duty of fairness owed to the applicant, and warrants the intervention of the Court on this basis alone. For this reason, the Court will:\n1. allow this application;\n2. set aside the decision of the visa officer;\n3. expect Mr. Chen to respond to the results of the fraud verification report by sending the Hong Kong visa office more information to prove the legitimacy of those contracts and to better explain the legitimacy of his source of funds; and\n4. expect a different visa officer to then redetermine the application for a visa in a reasonably expeditious manner having regard to the delays experienced on this file.\n\n[17]\nAccordingly, the Court does not need to consider the other two issues raised by the applicant. However, in obiter, I will briefly express my opinion on these other two issues for the benefit of the parties.\nIssue No. 2:\nDid the visa officer lack jurisdiction to refuse the applicant's application in light of the fact that he had been selected as an investor in the business category by the Province of Québec and had not been found inadmissible?\n\n[18]\nParagraph 9(1)(a) of the\nAct\nprovides that the applicant shall be granted permanent resident status because he met the Québec selection criteria as an investor immigration unless found inadmissible. The visa officer did not find the applicant inadmissible; rather, the visa officer said he could not be \"satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible\". This is not a finding that the applicant is inadmissible. If the visa officer concluded that Mr. Chen was not truthfully answering questions about his source of funds as required under s. 16 of the\nAct\n, the visa officer could have found Mr. Chen inadmissible under ss. 40 or 41 of the\nAct\n. He did not do so, and did not have the jurisdiction to deny a permanent resident visa to Mr. Chen under paragraph 9(1)(a) of the\nAct\n.\nIssue No. 3:\nDid the visa officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact in refusing the applicant's application?\n\n[19]\nThe visa officer clearly misunderstood the evidence before the Québec immigration officer and erroneously found that there was a contradiction in Mr. Chen's evidence about his initial working capital. Since the visa officer relied upon this misunderstanding to find that Mr. Chen could not have had the working capital in 1996 required under the chengbao contract or the capital to buy a house in 1996, this misunderstanding resulted in a patently unreasonable finding of fact.\nCosts\n\n[20]\nAt the hearing, the applicant sought for the first time legal costs under Rule 22 of the\nFederal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\n, SOR/93-22.\n\n[21]\nThe Rule for immigration judicial review applications is that no costs shall be awarded to or against any party unless the court so orders for \"special reasons\". In this case, the respondent has acted in good faith without any undue delay. The applicant knew the legitimacy of his funds (C$800,000) was an important issue. The applicant should have presented his source of funds in a manner which clearly shows they are legitimate. The applicant did not do so, and now, as a result of his Federal Court case, he has a second chance. However, I do not think the respondent's conduct in this case constitutes special reasons for awarding costs.\nCertified Question\n\n[22]\nThe Court is satisfied that this case does not raise a serious issue of general importance which ought to be certified with respect to procedural fairness. The determinative issue concerning procedural fairness is obvious and not of general importance. The other two issues, being obiter, are not determinative.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[23]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n:\n1. The application for judicial review is allowed;\n2. The visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence is set aside and remitted for reconsideration by a different visa officer after the applicant has submitted additional information to respond to the results of the fraud verification and any other information which the applicant wishes to submit to verify the legitimacy of his funds (i.e. C$800,000).\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Angela E.

The Minister may, for or within a class, suspend the examination of applications or cease to issue selection certificates until the beginning of the following calendar year if the Minister considers that the maximum number or estimate set out in the annual plan will be reached.\nSelection certificate.\nNotwithstanding the third or fourth paragraph, the Minister may, in accordance with the regulations, issue a selection certificate to a foreign national in a particularly distressful situation, in particular, in the case of Convention refugees as defined in the\nImmigration Act\n(Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, chapter I-2), or in any other case where the Minister considers that the results obtained following the application of the selection criteria do not reflect whether or not the foreign national will be able to become successfully established  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Conversely, the Minister may refuse to issue such a certificate to a foreign national who meets the conditions and criteria of selection if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national does not intend to settle  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or is unlikely to settle successfully  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  or that the settlement of the foreign national would be contrary to public interest.\"\n\"\nRessortissant étranger permanent.\n3.1. Un ressortissant étranger désirant s'établir à titre permanent au Québec doit, sauf pour les catégories ou dans les cas prévus par règlement, présenter une demande de certificat de sélection au ministre des Relations avec les citoyens et de l'Immigration conformément à la procédure visée au paragraphe f de l'article 3.3.\nDemande examinée.\nLe ministre examine la demande en tenant compte du plan annuel d'immigration et de l'ordre des priorités fixé par règlement.\nCertificat de sélection.\nLe ministre délivre un certificat de sélection au ressortissant étranger qui satisfait aux conditions et critères de sélection déterminés par règlement.\nAtteinte du maximum.\nLe ministre suspend l'examen des demandes ou cesse de délivrer des certificats de sélection pour une catégorie ou à l'intérieur d'une même catégorie jusqu'au début de l'année civile suivante, si le maximum prévu au plan annuel est atteint. Il peut, pour une catégorie ou à l'intérieur d'une même catégorie, suspendre l'examen des demandes ou cesser la délivrance des certificats de sélection jusqu'au début de l'année civile suivante, s'il est d'avis que le maximum ou l'estimation prévu au plan annuel sera atteint.\nCertificat de sélection.\nMalgré le troisième ou le quatrième alinéa, le ministre peut, conformément au règlement, délivrer un certificat de sélection à un ressortissant étranger qui est dans une situation particulière de détresse, notamment dans le cas de réfugiés au sens de la Convention, tels que définis dans la Loi sur l'immigration (Lois révisées du Canada (1985), chapitre I-2), ou dans tout autre cas où le ministre juge que le résultat obtenu, à la suite de l'application des critères de sélection, ne reflète pas les possibilités de ce ressortissant étranger de s'établir avec succès au Québec. À l'inverse, le ministre peut refuser de délivrer un tel certificat à celui qui satisfait aux conditions et critères de sélection s'il a des motifs raisonnables de croire que le ressortissant étranger n'a pas l'intention de s'établir au Québec, n'a que peu de possibilités de s'y établir avec succès ou dont l'établissement irait à l'encontre de l'intérêt public.\"\n2.\nRegulation respecting the selection of foreign nationals, c. I-0.2, r.5\n[as of March 29, 2004]\n\"\n2. Procedure for obtaining a selection and acceptance certificate\n2. The application for a selection certificate referred to in s. 3.1 of the Act is filed with the Minister by a foreign national for himself and for his family members whether or not they accompany him ; the application for a certificate of acceptance referred to in s. 3.2 of the Act is filed with the Minister by a foreign national for himself and for his accompanying family members.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the application for a selection certificate filed  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in a class referred to in ss. 110 to 115 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations or in ss. 25 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act may not consider the foreign national's family members who are not in Canada, except if they are already covered by an undertaking subscribed to under s. 23.\nIt may also be made in their name by a person having the right to act on their behalf when the foreign national does not have the legal capacity to do so. Furthermore, in the case of a foreign national belonging to the class of independent immigrants, the application for a selection certificate is filed by the said foreign national, or if he so wishes, by his spouse or de facto spouse.\n3. Any foreign national wishing to settle permanently  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  must hold a selection certificate issued by the Minister under s. 3.1 of the Act.\nThe application shall be made on the form provided by the Minister.\n. . . . .\n6.

      "An applicant, a Chinese businessman, applied for permanent residence in Canada as a Québec investor in June 2002.",
      "The initial application to the Province of Québec for nomination under the Québec investor category was refused in 2002 due to not meeting the investor class definition.",
      "The applicant was requested to provide further documentation regarding financial matters ('Other Payables' and a revolving fund) within 60 days.",
      "The applicant submitted the requested documentation, and a selection certificate was issued by the Province of Québec on March 29, 2004.",
      "Concurrently with the Québec application, the applicant applied for permanent residence under the investor immigrant category, submitting materials to demonstrate a net worth of at least $800,000.",
      "Submitted materials included contracts, property purchase agreements, receipts, sworn statements, business contracts, tax receipts, bank statements, audit reports, and balance sheets.",
      "An interview with a visa officer in Hong Kong took place on November 17, 2005.",
      "The visa officer refused the application for permanent residence on November 18, 2005, citing concerns about the applicant's admissibility and the origins of their net worth.",
      "The visa officer questioned the source of funds used to purchase a property in 1996 and the funding of a revolving fund related to a sub-contract agreement.",
      "The applicant had previously stated the revolving fund came from personal savings and a credit line from a Hong Kong supplier.",
      "The visa officer identified discrepancies and flagged three submitted contracts as potentially fraudulent.",
      "The applicant was not informed of the fraud findings prior to the interview and was not given an opportunity to respond to the specific concerns."

    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The visa officer breached the duty of fairness by not disclosing fraud reports regarding submitted contracts before the interview and refusing to provide an opportunity to respond.",
        "The visa officer lacked jurisdiction to refuse the application because the applicant had been selected by Québec as an investor and was not found inadmissible.",
        "The visa officer made patently unreasonable findings of fact by misunderstanding evidence regarding the applicant's initial working capital and its source.",
        "The visa officer incorrectly stated the applicant was not 'satisfied that the applicant is not inadmissible' rather than making a finding of inadmissibility.",
        "The applicant submitted sufficient documentation to demonstrate the legitimacy of funds, including contracts, purchase agreements, receipts, sworn statements, and financial records."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The applicant failed to adequately account for the origins of his net worth, making it impossible to assess admissibility.",
        "The applicant did not comply with requests for evidence to demonstrate that his net worth was derived from legal and legitimate sources.",
        "The applicant did not answer truthfully all questions and produce all relevant evidence as required by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.",
        "The source of funds used to purchase the Property in 1996 was questionable, as the purchase price exceeded the applicant's earnings from 1984-1996.",
        "The applicant could not have operated the *chengbao* sub-contract agreement without start-up funds, and the source of those funds was unclear.",
        "The applicant previously provided inconsistent statements regarding the source of funds for the *chengbao* revolving fund.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found a breach of procedural fairness because the visa officer did not disclose fraud reports concerning submitted contracts to the applicant prior to the interview or decision, and did not provide an adequate opportunity to respond to the allegations of fraud. The court relied on precedent establishing the duty to allow an applicant to respond to central concerns and extrinsic evidence.",
      "The court determined the appropriate standard of review for factual findings by the visa officer was patent unreasonableness, given the context of immigration law and the visa officer’s expertise, while questions of procedural fairness and jurisdiction were reviewed on a standard of correctness.",
      "The court found the visa officer lacked jurisdiction to deny the application under paragraph 9(1)(a) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* because the officer did not find the applicant inadmissible, only that they were not satisfied he was *not* inadmissible. The Act requires a finding of inadmissibility for denial in this context.",
      "The court, *obiter*, found the visa officer’s factual finding regarding a contradiction in the applicant’s evidence about initial working capital to be patently unreasonable, as it stemmed from a misunderstanding of evidence presented to the Quebec immigration officer.",
      "The court interpreted the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* and the Canada-Québec Accord, emphasizing that once a province selects an investor, the federal government’s role is generally limited to determining admissibility, not re-assessing the merits of the provincial selection.",
      "The court applied the principle that a failure to disclose crucial evidence (the fraud reports) and provide a meaningful opportunity to respond constitutes a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, necessitating setting aside the decision."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application for judicial review is allowed.",
      "The visa officer's decision dated November 18, 2005 refusing the applicant's application for permanent residence is set aside and remitted for reconsideration by a different visa officer.",
      "The applicant shall submit additional information to respond to the results of the fraud verification.",
      "A different visa officer shall redetermine the application in a reasonably expeditious manner."
