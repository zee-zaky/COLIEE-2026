    "[1]\nLeBlanc, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of a Senior Immigration Officer (the Officer), dated August 30, 2013, rejecting the applicants' pre-removal risk assessment application submitted pursuant to s 112 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[the Act]. The applicants claim that the Officer's state protection analysis and conclusions are flawed and warrant intervention from this Court.",
    "[2]\nFor the reasons that follow, I shall dismiss the applicants' judicial review application.\nI.\nBackground\nA.\nThe Applicants Arrival in Canada and the Failed Refuge Claim",
    "[3]\nThe applicants are mother and son. They are from Portugal. They arrived in Canada, as temporary residents, in September 2009. Fifteen months later, in late December 2010, they claimed refugee status under s 96 and 97 of the Act, on the basis that they were victims of domestic violence on the part of the ex-husband and father and could not expect adequate state protection in Portugal.",
    "[4]\nOn April 18, 2012, the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [the RPD] dismissed their claim on the ground that the evidence in areas crucial to their claim lacked reliable and credible support or, in the case of Portugal's alleged inability or unwillingness to protect them, was not clear and convincing.",
    "[5]\nThe RPD accepted that the applicants had been subject to forms of domestic violence but found that the applicants had failed to provide sufficient, independent and reliable evidence that they were under any prospective threats of serious harm by any persecutory agent. In particular, it was not satisfied that the applicants' allegations of attacks and attempted assaults in July and August of 2009 were credible.",
    "[6]\nIt also found that the applicants had failed to establish that their re-availment to Portugal at highly material time to their refugee claims, that is, in or around September 2009, was justified and reasonable in all the circumstances. It further held that the applicants had not credibly explained why it was only fifteen months after their arrival in Canada that they had filed their claims.",
    "[7]\nFinally, the RPD concluded that the alleged refusal by the police to assist and protect the applicants had not been credibly established. In particular, it held that country condition documentation showed that Portugal was making serious efforts to protect its citizens from the forms of abuse set out in the applicants' claims, that the applicants themselves were able to avail of various mechanisms of protection and redress and that, in any event, the imperfection of state protection was not an adequate basis for a refugee claim.\nB.\nThe RPD' Decision Upheld as being Reasonable",
    "[8]\nIn February 2013, this Court, disposing of the applicants' judicial review application against the RPD's decision, saw no reasons to interfere with the RPD's findings (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  state protection, the Court stressed the fact that in a democracy such as Portugal, there is a significant burden on refugee claimants to establish that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. It also observed that the RPD had before it considerable country condition documentation that demonstrated that, while domestic violence was an ongoing problem in that country, police protection, if sought, would have been available.\nC.\nThe Pre-removal Risk Assessment Application and the Decision under Review",
    "[9] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[10]\nOn June 11, 2013, the applicants submitted to the Minister a Pre-removal risk assessment application identifying the same risks as those expressed in the refugee claims, that is, fear of serious harm from the ex-husband and father and absence of adequate state protection.",
    "[11]\nThis applicants' application was rejected on August 30, 2013. The Officer, acting on behalf of the Minister, first observed that no new information or supporting independent reliable evidence had been provided to support the applicants' allegations that they would be a target of serious harm or continue to be targeted or sought by the ex-husband and father in Portugal, and that adequate state protection would not be available for them in Portugal.",
    "[12]\nAs a result, the Officer found the applicants not to be persons in need of protection within the meaning of s 96 and 97 of the Act.",
    "[13]\nAfter having so found, he also looked at current country conditions. He observed that Portugal is a constitutional democracy which generally upholds the human rights of its citizens through a defined system of law and order that is administered by security and police forces and enforced by an independent judiciary.",
    "[14]\nHe also noted that domestic violence is illegal and subject to criminal penalties in that country, but that it continues to be a serious concern due to societal attitudes which discourage victims from accessing the Portuguese justice system. In this regard, he found that the Portuguese government was addressing the problem by encouraging complaints to be filed against alleged persecutors and by making serious efforts, through various initiatives, to provide protection for victims of domestic abuse.\nD.\nThe Removal Order and its Subsequent Stay",
    "[15]\nOn December 18, 2013, the applicants were served with a direction to report which indicated that they were to be removed from Canada on January 12, 2014.",
    "[16]\nThis removal order was stayed by Court order pending the outcome of the present judicial review application.\nE.\nThe Applicants' Challenge to the Officer's Decision",
    "[17]\nThe applicants do not challenge the Officer's findings that they failed to discharge the onus of providing evidence addressing the RPD's findings on the alleged risks of domestic violence and state protection.",
    "[18]\nWhat they are challenging is that, even if he did not have to, the Officer, by looking at the current country conditions, was bound to come up with a reasonable finding, which he did not. For that reason, they claim the Officer's decision must be set aside.\nII.\nIssue and Standard of Review",
    "[19]\nThe issue that stems from the applicants' attack on the impugned decision is whether the Officer committed a reviewable error in his analysis and findings regarding Portugal's current country conditions.",
    "[20]\nIt is well established that decisions taken on pre-removal risk assessments, including on state protection issues, attract deference as they are in large part the result of a fact-driven inquiry for which the Minister and his delegates have a specialized expertise. They are, therefore, to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nNavarro Canseco\n]).",
    "[21]\nThis means that in the absence of a failure to consider relevant factors or reliance upon irrelevant ones, the weighing of the evidence lies within the purview of the Minister and his delegates and does not normally give rise to judicial review, (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).",
    "[22]\nHowever, there is, in my view, a more fundamental question that first needs to be addressed. This question is whether it is even open to the applicants to dispute the Officer's findings on current country conditions in the absence of a challenge to his primary conclusion, that conclusion being that the applicants failed to provide evidence addressing the RPD's findings, later confirmed by this Court, on the alleged risks of domestic violence and on the availability of police protection, should it be sought by the applicants.",
    "[23]\nIn other words, assuming the Officer was wrong in his assessment of an issue he no longer needed to decide, given that he had already concluded that the applicants were not persons in need within the meaning of s 96 and 97 of the Act, can his decision still be set aside without a challenge of his primary findings being initiated?",
    "[24]\nI am of the view that it cannot.\nIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nThe Absence of a Challenge to the Officer's Primary Finding is Fatal to the Applicants",
    "[25]\nThe applicants' position is pretty clear. They concede that the Officer did not have to look at the country's current conditions but since he did, his conclusions had to be reasonable. The applicants contend that they were not, and that this vitiates the whole decision.",
    "[26]\nThe statutory authority for a pre-removal risk assessment is set out in s 112 of the Act. That provision enables the Minister - or his delegate - to determine whether a person who faces a removal order is in need of protection. That determination is conducted on the grounds set out in s 96 and 97 of the Act. These provisions are reproduced in the Annex to this decision.",
    "[27]\nAs the Federal Court of Appeal reminds us in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the policy basis for assessing risk prior to removal is found in Canada's domestic and international commitments to the principle of non-refoulement which holds that a person should not be removed from Canada to a country where he or she would be at risk of persecution, torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 10).",
    "[28]\nHowever, a person seeking Canada's protection bears the onus of establishing that he or she meets the conditions set out in s 96 or 97 of the Act (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )",
    "[29]\nWhen one looks at the structure of those two provisions, a person seeking Canada's protection must first establish that he or she would face one of the risks set out in these provisions if returned to his or her country of origin. If this is established, then the person must show that he or she would be unable, or, because of that risk, unwilling, to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. Conversely, if the likelihood of such a risk is not established, then the issue of whether state protection is available to him or her becomes irrelevant.",
    "[30]\nHere, although it was ready to accept that the applicants had been the subject of forms of abuse in the course of their domestic relationship with the ex-husband and father, the RPD found that the applicants have failed to establish they would face one of the risks identified at s 96 and 97 of the Act if they were to be removed to Portugal.",
    "[31]\nWhen they appeared before the Officer following their failed refugee claim and judicial review proceeding, the applicants did not produce any new information or supporting independent and reliable evidence to corroborate the allegations that were before the RPD.",
    "[32]\nThis was enough for the Officer to conclude that the applicants were not persons in need of protection within the meaning of s 96 and 97 for the purposes of their pre-removal risk assessment request. More importantly, this was enough to dispose of the applicants' request. The applicants agree with that and they do not challenge the Officer's finding in this regard.",
    "[33]\nThe fact that the Officer then went on to look at current country conditions, presumably for the sake of completeness, does not, cannot and should not, alter the validity of his primary finding which, again, was dispositive of the applicants' request.",
    "[34]\nIn such context, the current country conditions analysis can only be characterised as an obiter or subsidiary finding with respect to an issue that had already been decided. I cannot see how, even assuming the Officer was wrong in his analysis, this could impact on the Officer's primary finding and on the decision as a whole.",
    "[35]\nIn\nThe\nMinister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Federal Court of Appeal deplored the fact that the review judge had not address the primary finding of the RPD which, if he had done so, could have ended the litigation and prevented an appeal on a subsidiary ground for dismissing the refugee claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 14-15) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[36]\nHere, the applicants have not challenged the Officer's main reason for dismissing their pre-removal risk assessment request. Simply put, they have failed to establish that they are at risk. This is all it takes, in my view, to dismiss the present judicial review application.",
    "[37]\nIn any event, I am of the view that the applicants have failed to establish that the Officer's findings on Portugal's current condition are unreasonable.\nB.\nThe Officer's Subsidiary Finding On Current Country Conditions Is, In Any Event, Reasonable",
    "[38]\nAt this stage, it is worth repeating that the applicants are failed refugee claimants and that they unsuccessfully challenged the RPD's findings, including those related to state protection and country conditions. As Madam Justice Snider stated in dismissing the applicants' challenge to the RPD decision, it is well settled that in a democratic state there is a significant burden on refugee claimants to establish that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. In other words, the more democratic the state's institutions are, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all available avenues. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 15).",
    "[39]\nThis rule stems from the presumption of state protection which, as Mr. Justice Laforest stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , \"serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the refugee claimant\" (\nWard\n, at para 51; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 25).",
    "[40]\nA refugee claimant coming from a democratic country, like Portugal, will therefore have \"a heavy burden when attempting to show that he should not have been required to exhaust all of the resources available to him domestically before claiming refugee status\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26). In practical terms, this means that the person seeking to rebut the presumption of state protection must adduce \"relevant, reliable and convincing evidence which satisfies the trier of fact on balance of probabilities that the state protection is inadequate\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 30).",
    "[41]\nWhen failed refugee claimants, such as the applicants, reach the stage of a pre-removal-risk assessment, they are not in the position of appellants of the RPD's decision. In\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that a pre-removal risk assessment by a failed refugee claimant is not an appeal or reconsideration of the decision of the RPD to reject the claim for refugee protection (\nRaza,\nat para 12).",
    "[42]\nAlthough such an assessment may require consideration of some or all of the same factual and legal issues as a claim for refugee protection, the Act mitigates, at s 113, the obvious risk of wasteful and potentially abusive relitigation by limiting the evidence that may be presented to a Minister's delegate. This limitation means, as Madam Justice Sharlow stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, \"that a negative refugee determination by the RPD must be respected by the PPRA officer unless there is\nnew evidence of facts that might have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing if this evidence had been presented to the RPD\n\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 12-13) [my emphasis].",
    "[43]\nThis \"new evidence\" can only be evidence that arose after the rejection of the refugee claim or that was not reasonably available at that time, or that the refugee claimant could not have been expected in the circumstances to have presented (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 182, at para 20).",
    "[44]\nAs previously stated, Mme Justice Snider, in dismissing the applicants' judicial review application against the RPD decision, ruled that it was reasonable for the RPD, based on the considerable country condition documentation that was before it, to find that, while domestic violence was an ongoing problem in Portugal, police protection, if sought by the applicants, would have been available.",
    "[45]\nThe applicants concede that they did not provide any new evidence in support of their allegations that state protection would not be available to them if they were to return to Portugal. This, alone, would be sufficient to dismiss their challenge to the Officer's finding regarding current country conditions to the extent it relates to state protection available to victims of domestic violence.",
    "[46]\nBut there is more. The applicants' submissions in this regard cannot be upheld.",
    "[47]\nThey claim that it was not enough for the Officer to state that the Portugal government was making \"serious efforts\" to provide protection to victims of domestic violence. They submit he rather had to be satisfied that these efforts had actually translated into meaningful protection and that in order to be meaningful, protection had to be provided by the police, not by non-law enforcement government institutions.",
    "[48]\nHowever, the Officer's decision has to be read as a whole (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para 27,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the absence of new evidence, the analysis on country conditions cannot be divorced from the primary finding that the applicants have failed to address the previous RPD's conclusion on the availability of adequate state protection in Portugal for people in their particular situation.",
    "[49]\nThe applicants rely heavily on this Court's decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to support their claim that the serious efforts' test is not the proper test in a state protection analysis However, that decision also reminds us that reference to these words in a state protection analysis will not automatically result in the analysis being set aside and that regard must be had to the decision\nas a whole\nin determining whether the proper test was applied ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 6) [my emphasis].",
    "[50]\nHere, there is no doubt that taken as a whole, the state protection analysis was done in accordance with the proper test, considering the role of a Minister' delegate when seized with a pre-removal risk assessment request presented by a failed refugee claimant.",
    "[51]\nAlso, as the Respondent points out, the country conditions' documentation on the pre-removal risk assessment application's record, and therefore available to the Officer, was less than 20 pages. It was even more limited with respect to the specific topic of domestic violence. However, the onus was not on the Officer, but on the applicants to provide new evidence on the unavailability of state protection for victims of domestic violence. They did not.",
    "[52]\nAccepting the applicants' position would be equivalent to ignoring this Court's dismissal of their judicial review application against the RPD's decision. In its decision, the Court observed that the RPD had considered \"considerable country condition documentation\" and found that it had reasonably concluded from it that while domestic violence was an ongoing problem in Portugal, police protection, if sought by the applicants, would have been available.",
    "[53]\nBearing in mind the previous RPD's finding, the upholding of these findings by this Court, the presumption of state protection in a democratic country such as Portugal that the applicants had the onus of rebutting, and the lack of any efforts on their part to show the Officer that the situation in Portugal had deteriorated over a span of less than 2 years to a point where state protection in that country is now no longer available, the judicial review of the Officer's decision calls for even greater deference.",
    "[54]\nFor all these reasons, the present judicial review application is dismissed.",
    "[55]\nNeither party has proposed a question of general importance. None will be certified.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[56]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The present application for judicial review is dismissed;\n2. No question is certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: J.

I cannot see how, even assuming the Officer was wrong in his analysis, this could impact on the Officer's primary finding and on the decision as a whole.\n[35]\nIn\nThe\nMinister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Federal Court of Appeal deplored the fact that the review judge had not address the primary finding of the RPD which, if he had done so, could have ended the litigation and prevented an appeal on a subsidiary ground for dismissing the refugee claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 14-15) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[36]\nHere, the applicants have not challenged the Officer's main reason for dismissing their pre-removal risk assessment request. Simply put, they have failed to establish that they are at risk. This is all it takes, in my view, to dismiss the present judicial review application.\n[37]\nIn any event, I am of the view that the applicants have failed to establish that the Officer's findings on Portugal's current condition are unreasonable.\nB.\nThe Officer's Subsidiary Finding On Current Country Conditions Is, In Any Event, Reasonable\n[38]\nAt this stage, it is worth repeating that the applicants are failed refugee claimants and that they unsuccessfully challenged the RPD's findings, including those related to state protection and country conditions. As Madam Justice Snider stated in dismissing the applicants' challenge to the RPD decision, it is well settled that in a democratic state there is a significant burden on refugee claimants to establish that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. In other words, the more democratic the state's institutions are, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all available avenues. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 15).\n[39]\nThis rule stems from the presumption of state protection which, as Mr. Justice Laforest stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , \"serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the refugee claimant\" (\nWard\n, at para 51; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 25).\n[40]\nA refugee claimant coming from a democratic country, like Portugal, will therefore have \"a heavy burden when attempting to show that he should not have been required to exhaust all of the resources available to him domestically before claiming refugee status\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26). In practical terms, this means that the person seeking to rebut the presumption of state protection must adduce \"relevant, reliable and convincing evidence which satisfies the trier of fact on balance of probabilities that the state protection is inadequate\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 30).\n[41]\nWhen failed refugee claimants, such as the applicants, reach the stage of a pre-removal-risk assessment, they are not in the position of appellants of the RPD's decision. In\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that a pre-removal risk assessment by a failed refugee claimant is not an appeal or reconsideration of the decision of the RPD to reject the claim for refugee protection (\nRaza,\nat para 12).\n[42]\nAlthough such an assessment may require consideration of some or all of the same factual and legal issues as a claim for refugee protection, the Act mitigates, at s 113, the obvious risk of wasteful and potentially abusive relitigation by limiting the evidence that may be presented to a Minister's delegate. This limitation means, as Madam Justice Sharlow stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, \"that a negative refugee determination by the RPD must be respected by the PPRA officer unless there is\nnew evidence of facts that might have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing if this evidence had been presented to the RPD\n\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 12-13) [my emphasis].\n[43]\nThis \"new evidence\" can only be evidence that arose after the rejection of the refugee claim or that was not reasonably available at that time, or that the refugee claimant could not have been expected in the circumstances to have presented (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FTR 182, at para 20).\n[44]\nAs previously stated, Mme Justice Snider, in dismissing the applicants' judicial review application against the RPD decision, ruled that it was reasonable for the RPD, based on the considerable country condition documentation that was before it, to find that, while domestic violence was an ongoing problem in Portugal, police protection, if sought by the applicants, would have been available.\n[45]\nThe applicants concede that they did not provide any new evidence in support of their allegations that state protection would not be available to them if they were to return to Portugal. This, alone, would be sufficient to dismiss their challenge to the Officer's finding regarding current country conditions to the extent it relates to state protection available to victims of domestic violence.\n[46]\nBut there is more. The applicants' submissions in this regard cannot be upheld.\n[47]\nThey claim that it was not enough for the Officer to state that the Portugal government was making \"serious efforts\" to provide protection to victims of domestic violence. They submit he rather had to be satisfied that these efforts had actually translated into meaningful protection and that in order to be meaningful, protection had to be provided by the police, not by non-law enforcement government institutions.\n[48]\nHowever, the Officer's decision has to be read as a whole (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  para 27,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In the absence of new evidence, the analysis on country conditions cannot be divorced from the primary finding that the applicants have failed to address the previous RPD's conclusion on the availability of adequate state protection in Portugal for people in their particular situation.\n[49]\nThe applicants rely heavily on this Court's decision in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  to support their claim that the serious efforts' test is not the proper test in a state protection analysis However, that decision also reminds us that reference to these words in a state protection analysis will not automatically result in the analysis being set aside and that regard must be had to the decision\nas a whole\nin determining whether the proper test was applied ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 6) [my emphasis].\n[50]\nHere, there is no doubt that taken as a whole, the state protection analysis was done in accordance with the proper test, considering the role of a Minister' delegate when seized with a pre-removal risk assessment request presented by a failed refugee claimant.\n[51]\nAlso, as the Respondent points out, the country conditions' documentation on the pre-removal risk assessment application's record, and therefore available to the Officer, was less than 20 pages. It was even more limited with respect to the specific topic of domestic violence. However, the onus was not on the Officer, but on the applicants to provide new evidence on the unavailability of state protection for victims of domestic violence. They did not.\n[52]\nAccepting the applicants' position would be equivalent to ignoring this Court's dismissal of their judicial review application against the RPD's decision. In its decision, the Court observed that the RPD had considered \"considerable country condition documentation\" and found that it had reasonably concluded from it that while domestic violence was an ongoing problem in Portugal, police protection, if sought by the applicants, would have been available.\n[53]\nBearing in mind the previous RPD's finding, the upholding of these findings by this Court, the presumption of state protection in a democratic country such as Portugal that the applicants had the onus of rebutting, and the lack of any efforts on their part to show the Officer that the situation in Portugal had deteriorated over a span of less than 2 years to a point where state protection in that country is now no longer available, the judicial review of the Officer's decision calls for even greater deference.\n[54]\nFor all these reasons, the present judicial review application is dismissed.\n[55]\nNeither party has proposed a question of general importance. None will be certified.\nJUDGMENT\n[56]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\n:\n1. The present application for judicial review is dismissed;\n2.

  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nLeBlanc, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of a Senior Immigration Officer (the Officer), dated August 30, 2013, rejecting the applicants' pre-removal risk assessment application submitted pursuant to s 112 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[the Act]. The applicants claim that the Officer's state protection analysis and conclusions are flawed and warrant intervention from this Court.\n\n[2]\nFor the reasons that follow, I shall dismiss the applicants' judicial review application.\nI.\nBackground\nA.\nThe Applicants Arrival in Canada and the Failed Refuge Claim\n\n[3]\nThe applicants are mother and son. They are from Portugal. They arrived in Canada, as temporary residents, in September 2009. Fifteen months later, in late December 2010, they claimed refugee status under s 96 and 97 of the Act, on the basis that they were victims of domestic violence on the part of the ex-husband and father and could not expect adequate state protection in Portugal.\n\n[4]\nOn April 18, 2012, the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [the RPD] dismissed their claim on the ground that the evidence in areas crucial to their claim lacked reliable and credible support or, in the case of Portugal's alleged inability or unwillingness to protect them, was not clear and convincing.\n\n[5]\nThe RPD accepted that the applicants had been subject to forms of domestic violence but found that the applicants had failed to provide sufficient, independent and reliable evidence that they were under any prospective threats of serious harm by any persecutory agent. In particular, it was not satisfied that the applicants' allegations of attacks and attempted assaults in July and August of 2009 were credible.\n\n[6]\nIt also found that the applicants had failed to establish that their re-availment to Portugal at highly material time to their refugee claims, that is, in or around September 2009, was justified and reasonable in all the circumstances. It further held that the applicants had not credibly explained why it was only fifteen months after their arrival in Canada that they had filed their claims.\n\n[7]\nFinally, the RPD concluded that the alleged refusal by the police to assist and protect the applicants had not been credibly established. In particular, it held that country condition documentation showed that Portugal was making serious efforts to protect its citizens from the forms of abuse set out in the applicants' claims, that the applicants themselves were able to avail of various mechanisms of protection and redress and that, in any event, the imperfection of state protection was not an adequate basis for a refugee claim.\nB.\nThe RPD' Decision Upheld as being Reasonable\n\n[8]\nIn February 2013, this Court, disposing of the applicants' judicial review application against the RPD's decision, saw no reasons to interfere with the RPD's findings (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  state protection, the Court stressed the fact that in a democracy such as Portugal, there is a significant burden on refugee claimants to establish that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. It also observed that the RPD had before it considerable country condition documentation that demonstrated that, while domestic violence was an ongoing problem in that country, police protection, if sought, would have been available.\nC.\nThe Pre-removal Risk Assessment Application and the Decision under Review\n\n[9] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[10]\nOn June 11, 2013, the applicants submitted to the Minister a Pre-removal risk assessment application identifying the same risks as those expressed in the refugee claims, that is, fear of serious harm from the ex-husband and father and absence of adequate state protection.\n\n[11]\nThis applicants' application was rejected on August 30, 2013. The Officer, acting on behalf of the Minister, first observed that no new information or supporting independent reliable evidence had been provided to support the applicants' allegations that they would be a target of serious harm or continue to be targeted or sought by the ex-husband and father in Portugal, and that adequate state protection would not be available for them in Portugal.\n\n[12]\nAs a result, the Officer found the applicants not to be persons in need of protection within the meaning of s 96 and 97 of the Act.\n\n[13]\nAfter having so found, he also looked at current country conditions. He observed that Portugal is a constitutional democracy which generally upholds the human rights of its citizens through a defined system of law and order that is administered by security and police forces and enforced by an independent judiciary.\n\n[14]\nHe also noted that domestic violence is illegal and subject to criminal penalties in that country, but that it continues to be a serious concern due to societal attitudes which discourage victims from accessing the Portuguese justice system. In this regard, he found that the Portuguese government was addressing the problem by encouraging complaints to be filed against alleged persecutors and by making serious efforts, through various initiatives, to provide protection for victims of domestic abuse.\nD.\nThe Removal Order and its Subsequent Stay\n\n[15]\nOn December 18, 2013, the applicants were served with a direction to report which indicated that they were to be removed from Canada on January 12, 2014.\n\n[16]\nThis removal order was stayed by Court order pending the outcome of the present judicial review application.\nE.\nThe Applicants' Challenge to the Officer's Decision\n\n[17]\nThe applicants do not challenge the Officer's findings that they failed to discharge the onus of providing evidence addressing the RPD's findings on the alleged risks of domestic violence and state protection.\n\n[18]\nWhat they are challenging is that, even if he did not have to, the Officer, by looking at the current country conditions, was bound to come up with a reasonable finding, which he did not. For that reason, they claim the Officer's decision must be set aside.\nII.\nIssue and Standard of Review\n\n[19]\nThe issue that stems from the applicants' attack on the impugned decision is whether the Officer committed a reviewable error in his analysis and findings regarding Portugal's current country conditions.\n\n[20]\nIt is well established that decisions taken on pre-removal risk assessments, including on state protection issues, attract deference as they are in large part the result of a fact-driven inquiry for which the Minister and his delegates have a specialized expertise. They are, therefore, to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nNavarro Canseco\n]).\n\n[21]\nThis means that in the absence of a failure to consider relevant factors or reliance upon irrelevant ones, the weighing of the evidence lies within the purview of the Minister and his delegates and does not normally give rise to judicial review, (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n\n[22]\nHowever, there is, in my view, a more fundamental question that first needs to be addressed. This question is whether it is even open to the applicants to dispute the Officer's findings on current country conditions in the absence of a challenge to his primary conclusion, that conclusion being that the applicants failed to provide evidence addressing the RPD's findings, later confirmed by this Court, on the alleged risks of domestic violence and on the availability of police protection, should it be sought by the applicants.\n\n[23]\nIn other words, assuming the Officer was wrong in his assessment of an issue he no longer needed to decide, given that he had already concluded that the applicants were not persons in need within the meaning of s 96 and 97 of the Act, can his decision still be set aside without a challenge of his primary findings being initiated?\n\n[24]\nI am of the view that it cannot.\nIII.\nAnalysis\nA.\nThe Absence of a Challenge to the Officer's Primary Finding is Fatal to the Applicants\n\n[25]\nThe applicants' position is pretty clear. They concede that the Officer did not have to look at the country's current conditions but since he did, his conclusions had to be reasonable. The applicants contend that they were not, and that this vitiates the whole decision.\n\n[26]\nThe statutory authority for a pre-removal risk assessment is set out in s 112 of the Act. That provision enables the Minister - or his delegate - to determine whether a person who faces a removal order is in need of protection. That determination is conducted on the grounds set out in s 96 and 97 of the Act. These provisions are reproduced in the Annex to this decision.\n\n[27]\nAs the Federal Court of Appeal reminds us in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, the policy basis for assessing risk prior to removal is found in Canada's domestic and international commitments to the principle of non-refoulement which holds that a person should not be removed from Canada to a country where he or she would be at risk of persecution, torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 10).\n\n[28]\nHowever, a person seeking Canada's protection bears the onus of establishing that he or she meets the conditions set out in s 96 or 97 of the Act (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )\n\n[29]\nWhen one looks at the structure of those two provisions, a person seeking Canada's protection must first establish that he or she would face one of the risks set out in these provisions if returned to his or her country of origin. If this is established, then the person must show that he or she would be unable, or, because of that risk, unwilling, to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. Conversely, if the likelihood of such a risk is not established, then the issue of whether state protection is available to him or her becomes irrelevant.\n\n[30]\nHere, although it was ready to accept that the applicants had been the subject of forms of abuse in the course of their domestic relationship with the ex-husband and father, the RPD found that the applicants have failed to establish they would face one of the risks identified at s 96 and 97 of the Act if they were to be removed to Portugal.\n\n[31]\nWhen they appeared before the Officer following their failed refugee claim and judicial review proceeding, the applicants did not produce any new information or supporting independent and reliable evidence to corroborate the allegations that were before the RPD.\n\n[32]\nThis was enough for the Officer to conclude that the applicants were not persons in need of protection within the meaning of s 96 and 97 for the purposes of their pre-removal risk assessment request. More importantly, this was enough to dispose of the applicants' request. The applicants agree with that and they do not challenge the Officer's finding in this regard.\n\n[33]\nThe fact that the Officer then went on to look at current country conditions, presumably for the sake of completeness, does not, cannot and should not, alter the validity of his primary finding which, again, was dispositive of the applicants' request.\n\n[34]\nIn such context, the current country conditions analysis can only be characterised as an obiter or subsidiary finding with respect to an issue that had already been decided. I cannot see how, even assuming the Officer was wrong in his analysis, this could impact on the Officer's primary finding and on the decision as a whole.\n\n[35]\nIn\nThe\nMinister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], the Federal Court of Appeal deplored the fact that the review judge had not address the primary finding of the RPD which, if he had done so, could have ended the litigation and prevented an appeal on a subsidiary ground for dismissing the refugee claim ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 14-15) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[36]\nHere, the applicants have not challenged the Officer's main reason for dismissing their pre-removal risk assessment request. Simply put, they have failed to establish that they are at risk. This is all it takes, in my view, to dismiss the present judicial review application.\n\n[37]\nIn any event, I am of the view that the applicants have failed to establish that the Officer's findings on Portugal's current condition are unreasonable.\nB.\nThe Officer's Subsidiary Finding On Current Country Conditions Is, In Any Event, Reasonable\n\n[38]\nAt this stage, it is worth repeating that the applicants are failed refugee claimants and that they unsuccessfully challenged the RPD's findings, including those related to state protection and country conditions. As Madam Justice Snider stated in dismissing the applicants' challenge to the RPD decision, it is well settled that in a democratic state there is a significant burden on refugee claimants to establish that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. In other words, the more democratic the state's institutions are, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all available avenues. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 15).\n\n[39]\nThis rule stems from the presumption of state protection which, as Mr. Justice Laforest stated in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , \"serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the refugee claimant\" (\nWard\n, at para 51; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 25).\n\n[40]\nA refugee claimant coming from a democratic country, like Portugal, will therefore have \"a heavy burden when attempting to show that he should not have been required to exhaust all of the resources available to him domestically before claiming refugee status\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 26). In practical terms, this means that the person seeking to rebut the presumption of state protection must adduce \"relevant, reliable and convincing evidence which satisfies the trier of fact on balance of probabilities that the state protection is inadequate\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 30).\n\n[41]\nWhen failed refugee claimants, such as the applicants, reach the stage of a pre-removal-risk assessment, they are not in the position of appellants of the RPD's decision.

(1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n(2) A person who is in Canada and is part of a category of persons to whom the need for protection is recognized by regulation is also a person to be protected.",

      "Individuals from Portugal arrived in Canada as temporary residents in September 2009.",
      "In December 2010, they claimed refugee status based on experiencing domestic violence and concerns about inadequate state protection in Portugal.",
      "The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dismissed their refugee claim in April 2012, citing insufficient evidence of ongoing threats and questioning the reasonableness of their delayed claim.",
      "The RPD found that while domestic violence occurred, the applicants did not demonstrate a credible risk of future harm or inability to access protection in Portugal.",
      "A judicial review of the RPD's decision was dismissed in February 2013.",
      "In June 2013, the applicants submitted a pre-removal risk assessment application, reiterating fears of harm from a former partner and lack of state protection.",
      "This pre-removal risk assessment application was rejected in August 2013, as no new evidence was presented to support their claims.",
      "The assessing officer noted Portugal's democratic system and efforts to address domestic violence.",
      "A removal order was issued in December 2013 but stayed pending the outcome of a judicial review.",
      "The applicants challenged the officer's assessment of current country conditions, but did not dispute the finding that they had not provided sufficient evidence to support their initial claims."

      "Applicants": [
        "The Officer's state protection analysis and conclusions were flawed.",
        "Even if the Officer did not have to, his assessment of current country conditions was unreasonable and should lead to the decision being set aside.",
        "The Officer should have found that state protection in Portugal was not reasonably forthcoming.",
        "The Officer's finding that the Portuguese government was making 'serious efforts' to provide protection was insufficient; he should have determined if those efforts translated into meaningful protection.",
        "The previous RPD findings regarding the availability of state protection should be reconsidered in light of current country conditions."

      "Respondents": [
        "The applicants failed to provide new information or supporting evidence to support their claims of risk of harm or lack of state protection in Portugal.",
        "The applicants conceded the Officer did not *have* to look at current country conditions.",
        "The Officer's analysis of current country conditions, even if flawed, did not impact his primary finding that the applicants were not persons in need of protection.",
        "The applicants failed to rebut the presumption of state protection in a democratic country like Portugal.",
        "The applicants did not provide evidence showing a deterioration of conditions in Portugal since the RPD decision.",
        "The pre-removal risk assessment is not an appeal of the RPD decision and is limited by the evidence that can be presented (s. 113 of the Act).",
        "The applicants failed to meet the burden of providing new evidence of risks not previously considered."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court dismissed the applicants' judicial review application, finding no reviewable error in the Immigration Officer's decision to reject their pre-removal risk assessment.",
      "The central reasoning was that the applicants failed to challenge the Officer's primary finding – that they had not established a risk of persecution or inability to access state protection in Portugal, as previously determined by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and upheld by the court.",
      "The court held that the Officer's subsequent analysis of current country conditions was *obiter* – a subsidiary finding – because the primary finding was dispositive. Even if the country conditions analysis was flawed, it could not impact the overall decision without a challenge to the primary finding.",
      "The court emphasized the statutory framework of s. 112 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which requires applicants to establish a risk of persecution under s. 96 or 97 to be eligible for protection.  Since the applicants did not present new evidence to address the RPD’s findings regarding risk and state protection, the Officer correctly concluded they were not 'persons in need of protection'.",
      "The court applied the standard of reasonableness to the Officer’s decision, acknowledging the Minister’s delegate has specialized expertise in these matters.  Absent a failure to consider relevant factors, the weighing of evidence is within the delegate’s purview.",
      "The court reiterated the principle that in a democratic country like Portugal, claimants bear a significant burden to demonstrate that state protection is unavailable, and the RPD had reasonably found that police protection would be available if sought.",
      "The court distinguished a pre-removal risk assessment from an appeal of the RPD’s decision, noting that s. 113 of the Act limits the evidence that can be presented, requiring 'new evidence' not reasonably available during the refugee claim process.",
      "The court found the Officer’s conclusion that the Portuguese government was making 'serious efforts' to protect victims of domestic violence, when considered in the context of the prior RPD findings and the lack of new evidence, was reasonable and did not require a finding of *actual* meaningful protection to be valid."
