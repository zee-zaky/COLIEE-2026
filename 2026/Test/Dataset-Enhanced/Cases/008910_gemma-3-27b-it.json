    "[1]\nRothstein, J.\n: This is an appeal by the defendant from an order of Giles, A.S.P., dated August 23, 1994 and signed on September 15, 1994 in which, inter alia, he struck certain portions of the defendants' statement of defence.",
    "[2]\nThe plaintiff's action is for infringement of three patents relating to excimer lasers used for eye surgery. The paragraphs in question (17, 27, 28, 29 and 32) of the statement of defence and counterclaim allege:\n(1) that the plaintiff is attempting to extract fees or royalties from doctors and others in respect of a medical treatment which it is said cannot be the subject of a patent;\n(2) that the plaintiff's action constitutes an undue limitation or restraint on competition under ss. 32(a) to (e) of the\nCompetition Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34 and an abuse of dominant position under s. 79(1) of the\nCompetition Act\n.",
    "[3]\nParagraph 36(c) of the statement of defence seeks an order, by reason of the aforesaid allegations, that the plaintiff's patents are unenforceable.",
    "[4]\nThe essence of the defendants' position is that the plaintiff's actions, in attempting to extract inappropriate fees and in contravening the\nCompetition Act\n, disentitled the plaintiff to equitable relief in its action. The defendants say that the plaintiff may be entitled to damages if it is successful, but it is not entitled to an injunction or to an accounting of the defendants' profits which are equitable forms of relief.",
    "[5]\nThe defendants rely on\nLilly (Eli) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) in which Addy, J., stated at page 255:\n\"2. A more cogent reason, however, is that the plaintiffs are seeking equitable relief and must come into the court with their hands clean. Should they in fact be in breach of the\nCombines Investigation Act\n, as alleged in para. 9 of the statement of defence, this would constitute a most valid reason for refusing injunction relief although the allegations might well not constitute a defence to a claim at law.\"\nHowever, the dicta of Addy, J., in\nEli Lilly\nhas been refined by\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) in which Hugessen, J.A., stated at page 546:\n\"We are all of the view that the motions judge erred in law since these allegations [breaches of the\nCompetition Act\n] can simply have no bearing on the defence to the plaintiffs' action for patent infringement. The motions judge indicated [at p. 230] that, because para. 16 speaks to plaintiffs' entitlement to equitable remedies, the amendment would be relevant to the courts 'discretion to grant or refuse such relief having regard to all of the surrounding circumstances including the past conduct of the plaintiffs'. This is error. For past conduct to be relevant to a refusal of equitable relief under the 'clean hands' doctrine, relief to which the party would otherwise be entitled, such conduct must relate directly to the subject-matter of the plaintiffs' claim, in this case their patent ...\"\nIt is apparent that it is not any alleged inappropriate conduct of a party that may be relevant in the consideration of whether or not to grant equitable relief. The inappropriate conduct must relate directly to the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim.",
    "[6]\nIn the case at bar, it may be that the plaintiff should not collect royalties in the way it is alleged it does. Or it may be that its conduct is contrary to certain provisions of the\nCompetition Act\n. However, even if the plaintiff is acting inappropriately, such actions do not relate directly to the plaintiff's patent or whether the defendants are infringing that patent. There is no suggestion that the patent is invalid or otherwise cannot form the basis of a patent infringement action; nor is it suggested that these allegations, in some way, indicate there is no patent infringement. It has not been demonstrated that such conduct is directly related to the plaintiff's claim.",

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether allegations of inappropriate conduct by the plaintiff – specifically, attempting to extract excessive fees and violating the Competition Act – were relevant to the defense against a patent infringement claim and potentially disentitled the plaintiff to equitable relief.",
      "The court distinguished between prior case law, specifically *Eli Lilly* and its subsequent refinement in a later Federal Court of Appeal decision. The earlier *Eli Lilly* case suggested that breaches of the Combines Investigation Act (precursor to the Competition Act) could impact a plaintiff’s entitlement to equitable relief.",
      "However, the court emphasized that the later Federal Court of Appeal decision clarified that such conduct must *directly relate* to the subject matter of the patent claim to be relevant to the ‘clean hands’ doctrine and the granting of equitable relief.",
      "The court found that the defendants’ allegations, even if true, did not directly relate to the validity of the plaintiff’s patent or whether infringement had occurred. The allegations concerned the *manner* in which the plaintiff sought to profit from the patent, not the patent itself or the act of infringement.",
      "The court reasoned that simply because the plaintiff *might* be acting inappropriately in its business practices did not mean the patent was invalid or that no infringement occurred. The allegations did not demonstrate a direct connection between the plaintiff’s alleged misconduct and the core claim of patent infringement.",
      "Therefore, the court upheld the lower court’s decision to strike those portions of the statement of defense and counterclaim, concluding that the alleged conduct was irrelevant to the defense of the patent infringement action."
