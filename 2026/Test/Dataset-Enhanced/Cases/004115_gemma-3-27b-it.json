Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nZinn, J.\n: Mr. Bighashi applied for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He indicated in his application that he had work experience as an accountant - National Occupation Classification code 1111 [NOC 1111].",
    "[2]\nAn officer determined that his application was not eligible for processing because the officer was \"not satisfied\" that he had worked as an accountant as described in NOC 111. The officer stated that Mr. Bighashi had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he had performed \"the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation\" and that he had \"performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC.\"",
    "[3]\nIn the officer's Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes, he explains that the duties \"described in the employment letter [of the Applicant] match those of bookkeeper rather than accountant.\" The employment letter states that the Applicant:\nHas been working at Accounting Unit since Aug. 3, 2005 and as an accountant and officer responsible for preparation of expenditures and payments document [sic], has been performing the following duties and responsibilities:\n1- Payment of different forms of liabilities by check [\nsic\n].\n2- Preparing list of expenses and their documents.\n3- In charge of payment of employees loan.\n4- Preparation of different forms of inventory reports and the related correspondences.",
    "[4]\nThe lead statement of NOC 1111 states that financial auditors and accountants:\n... examine and analyze the accounting and financial records of individuals and establishments to ensure accuracy and compliance with established accounting standards and procedures ... plan, organize and administer accounting systems for individuals and establishments.",
    "[5]\nIn contrast, the lead statement of NOC 1311 states that accounting technicians and bookkeepers:\n... maintain complete sets of books, keep records of accounts, verify the procedures used for recording financial transactions, and provide personal bookkeeping services. They are employed throughout the private and public sectors, or they may be self-employed.",
    "[6]\nThe Applicant submits that:\n1. The officer breached the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice by failing to inform him about his concerns and provide him with an opportunity to address them;\n2. The officer's finding that he is a bookkeeper rather than an accountant is unreasonable; and\n3. The officer failed to provide sufficient reasons for the decision reached.",
    "[7]\nFor the reasons that follow, none of those submissions are accepted.\nWas the Duty of Fairness Breached?",
    "[8]\nThe Applicant submits that he was entitled to be informed of the officer's concerns and provided with an opportunity to address them either because of manual OP 6A - a guide provided to immigration officers for assessing federal skilled worker applications - or the jurisprudence of this Court.",
    "[9]\nI agree with the Minister that at the relevant time, there were three steps in the Ministerial Instructions in OP 6A for processing Federal Skilled Worker applications. First, the application is reviewed in a cursory manner and an initial determination made as to whether it is complete and meets the criteria in the Ministerial Instructions. Mr. Bighashi's application passed this step. If that step is passed, the applicant is asked to submit his complete application and it is referred to a visa office for a final determination of\neligibility\nfor processing. It is this step that Mr. Bighashi's application failed. It is only if the application is finally determined to be eligible for processing at step two, that the application moves to the final step where the application itself is then subject to final processing and either approved or refused.",
    "[10]\nSection 10 of OP 6A which provides that if an officer has \"any concerns about the applicant's ability or likelihood to accept and carry out the employment, they will communicate these to the applicant and provide the opportunity to respond\", and that \"where officers have concerns about whether or not the applicant has carried out 'a substantial number of main duties ... including all of the essential duties,' they should give the applicant an opportunity to respond to these concerns,\" only applies to the processing at the last step of the process. I agree with the Minister that it does not apply to either of the first two steps and, as Mr. Bighashi's application was rejected at the second step as ineligible for processing, there was no requirement for notification under OP 6A as he claimed.",
    "[11]\nIt is also submitted that a duty of procedural fairness by way of notification and an opportunity to respond was triggered because the officer brought Mr. Bighashi's credibility into question.",
    "[12]\nMr. Bighashi cites\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paragraph 22, for the proposition that the duty of fairness requires an officer to provide an applicant with an opportunity to disabuse the officer's concerns \"even where such concerns arise from evidence tendered by the applicant.\" However, Justice Mosley went on at paragraph 23 to explain that it is not every concern about the evidence tendered that raises such a procedural duty:\nHowever, this principle of procedural fairness does not stretch to the point of requiring that a visa officer has an obligation to provide an applicant with a \"running score\" of the weaknesses in their application. And there is no obligation on the part of a visa officer to apprise an applicant of her concerns that arise directly from the requirements of the\nformer Act\nor\nRegulations\n[references omitted].",
    "[13]\nAlthough Mr. Bighashi has framed the officer's concerns as issues with his credibility, there is\nno evidence\nin the record that his credibility was questioned, nor was the authenticity of the documents he submitted questioned. The fact that the officer found there was insufficient evidence to support the Applicant's assertion that he was an accountant, as described in NOC 1111, is not a credibility finding. As was stated by Justice Muldoon in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"this duty does not arise merely because the visa officer has not been convinced, after weighing the evidence, that the application is well founded.\" If it were otherwise, then every negative decision under the Federal Skilled Workers Program would become a negative credibility finding requiring officers to advise applicants. This would be exactly the sort of \"running score\" process the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> exempted from any fairness requirement.",
    "[14]\nSince credibility is not in issue, I agree with the Minister's submission that the officer was not required to give the Applicant additional notice. That result is consistent with the decision of Justice Pinard in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wherein at paragraph 26, he writes:\n...where the visa officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations, he is under no duty to notify the applicant (\nKaur\nat para 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nRelevant work experience is a concern that arises from the regulations: a visa officer is under no duty to mention his concerns as to the applicant's work experience\n(\nKaur\nat para 12). Ultimately, the visa officer has no obligation to make inquiries where the applicant's application is ambiguous: \"there is no entitlement to an interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included\" (\nKaur\nat para 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 4).\nTo hold otherwise would impose on visa officers an obligation to give advance notice of a negative finding of eligibility\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 8). [emphasis added]\nWas the Officer's Decision Reasonable?",
    "[15]\nHaving determined that the officer did not breach the duty of fairness owed to the Applicant, I also find that the officer's conclusion that the Applicant did not submit sufficient evidence that he performed the actions required of an accountant as set out in NOC 1111, was reasonable. I agree with the officer's observation that the duties set out in the employment letter more closely matched those of the bookkeeper classification than those of an accountant. I reject the submission that Mr. Bighashi's application was\nassessed\nagainst the bookkeeper NOC code. All the officer did was to make an observation. The application was properly assessed for eligibility against NOC 1111.",
    "[16]\nSubsection 75(2) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [\nRules\n], sets out the requirements for immigrants applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Workers class:\n75. (2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if [during his or her employment, he or she]:\n...\n(b) ... performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification; and\n(c) ... performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification, including all of the essential duties ... [emphasis added]\n75. (2) A foreigner is a qualified worker who meets the following requirements [during this period of employment]:\n...\nb) ... he has accomplished all of the tasks appearing in the main statement established for the profession in the descriptions of the professions of this classification;\n(c) ... he performed a significant part of the main functions of the profession listed in the descriptions of the professions of this classification, including all the essential functions ... [emphasis added]",
    "[17]\nMr. Bighashi may be correct that the officer's reasons are not adequate because of the failure to identify which of the main duties were met and which were not. However, it is not immediately obvious to me that the description in the employment letter corresponds with\nany\nof the listed main duties and counsel was not able to offer much assistance to the Court in identifying them.",
    "[18]\nIn any event, the requirements in paragraphs 75(2)(b) and (c) are joint and a failure to meet either one renders the application ineligible. In this case, the officer found that Mr. Bighashi failed to meet both of them.",
    "[19]\nThe officer found that the employment letter did not establish on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Bighashi \"performed the actions in the lead statement.\" Nothing in the listed responsibilities in the employment letter can be interpreted as examining, analyzing, planning, or organizing and administering accounting and financial records. The Applicant's duties are limited to making payments and preparing lists, reports, and correspondence. The officer's reasons for this finding are adequate and reasonable.",
    "[20]\nMr. Bighashi has asked the officer to reconsider the decision and filed a second employment letter. That letter, as was readily admitted, cannot form part of the record before this Court as it was not before the officer when he made the decision. It was tendered on the fairness issue as proof that Mr. Bighashi could have provided evidence that he was performing the duties of an accountant had he been given an opportunity to do so.",
    "[21]\nThe Applicant submits that the second letter from Mr. Bighashi's employer adequately describes the activities set out in NOC 1111. Although irrelevant for present purposes, I note that there are reasons to doubt the reliability of the evidence because:\n(a) Mr. Bighashi's name is misspelled (it is spelled \"Bighash\" instead of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );\n(b) The date is incorrect (the letter is dated 2002 instead of 2012); and\n(c) The letter lists five duties that Mr. Bighashi has had for the past 14 years, but none of the duties listed in the first letter appear in the second letter - the described duties are entirely new and different.",
    "[22]\nComparing the second letter to the first letter leads to the view that two entirely different jobs are being described. The first letter clearly emphasizes the clerical nature of Mr. Bighashi's duties while the second letter focuses solely on the higher level analytical aspects of Mr. Bighashi's role. If the second letter truly is a more accurate description of Mr. Bighashi's duties, it begs the question of why he would have submitted the first letter instead of immediately requesting a revised version that more accurately described his actual duties.",
    "[23]\nFor these reasons the application must be dismissed. Neither party proposed a question for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[24]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application is dismissed and no question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Bighashi has applied for permanent residence in Canada under the Federal Skilled Worker category.

Neither party proposed a question for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n[24]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application is dismissed and no question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Bighashi a présenté une demande de résidence permanente au Canada au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). Dans sa demande, il a indiqué qu'il avait de l'expérience de travail en tant que comptable - code 1111 de la Classification nationale des professions [code CNP 1111].\n[2]\nUn agent a déterminé que la demande était irrecevable aux fins de traitement, car il n'était pas convaincu que le demandeur avait travaillé comme comptable, selon la description du code CNP 1111. Selon l'agent, M. Bighashi n'avait pas fourni une preuve suffisante pour démontrer qu'il avait accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession et exercé toutes les fonctions essentielles et une partie appréciable des fonctions principales énoncées dans les descriptions des professions de la CNP.\n[3]\nDans les notes qu'il a consignées dans le Système de traitement informatisé des dossiers d'immigration, l'agent explique que les fonctions [traduction]  décrites dans la lettre d'emploi [du demandeur] correspondent à celles d'un teneur de livres plutôt qu'à celles d'un comptable . La lettre d'emploi indique que le demandeur:\n[traduction] A commencé à travailler à l'unité de la comptabilité le 3 août 2005 à titre de comptable et d'agent responsable de la préparation des documents sur les dépenses et les paiements, et était chargé des fonctions et des responsabilités suivantes:\n1- Paiements effectués par chèque au titre de différents éléments de passif.\n2- Préparation des listes des dépenses et des documents connexes.\n3- Paiement des prêts d'employé.\n4- Préparation de différents rapports d'inventaire et de la correspondance connexe.\n[4]\nD'après l'énoncé principal établi pour le code CNP 1111, les vérificateurs et les comptables:\n[...] examinent et analysent les documents comptables et registres financiers de particuliers ou d'entreprises, afin d'assurer l'exactitude des documents en accord avec les principes comptables généralement reconnus [...] planifient, organisent et administrent des systèmes de comptabilité pour des particuliers ou des entreprises.\n[5]\nPar contre, d'après l'énoncé principal établi pour le code CNP 1311, les techniciens en comptabilité et les teneurs de livres:\n[...] gèrent des séries complètes de livres, tiennent les registres des comptes, vérifient les méthodes utilisées pour comptabiliser les opérations financières et fournissent des services de tenue de livres à des particuliers. Ils travaillent dans les secteurs privé et public ou ils peuvent être des travailleurs autonomes.\n[6]\nLe demandeur affirme que:\n1. L'agent a manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale et de justice naturelle en omettant de lui faire part de ses doutes et en ne lui donnant pas l'occasion de les dissiper;\n2. La conclusion de l'agent selon laquelle il est teneur de livres plutôt que comptable est déraisonnable;\n3. L'agent n'a pas donné des motifs suffisants à l'appui de sa décision.\n[7]\nPour les motifs exposés ci-dessous, aucune de ces allégations n'est acceptée.\nY a-t-il eu manquement à l'obligation d'équité procédurale?\n[8]\nLe demandeur soutient qu'il avait le droit d'être informé des doutes de l'agent et d'avoir l'occasion de les dissiper, que ce soit sur le fondement du guide OP 6A - un guide dont se servent les agents d'immigration pour évaluer les demandes présentées au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) - ou de la jurisprudence de la Cour.\n[9]\nJe conviens avec le ministre qu'à l'époque pertinente, les instructions ministérielles énoncées dans le guide OP 6A prévoyaient le traitement en trois étapes des demandes présentées au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral). À l'étape un, le bureau devait évaluer la demande pour voir si elle était complète et satisfaisait aux critères établis dans les instructions ministérielles. La demande de M. Bighashi a franchi cette étape. Le demandeur devait ensuite soumettre sa demande complète, qui était alors examinée par un agent des visas, lequel devait se prononcer sur la\nrecevabilité\nde la demande aux fins de traitement. C'est à cette étape que la demande de M. Bighashi a échoué. La demande devait être jugée recevable aux fins de traitement à l'étape 2 pour passer à la dernière étape, où la demande comme telle était traitée, et acceptée ou rejetée.\n[10]\nLa section 10 du guide OP 6A, qui prévoit que si l'agent a des doutes quant aux aptitudes du demandeur ou à sa volonté d'accepter et d'occuper l'emploi, ou encore sur le fait que le demandeur a exercé toutes les fonctions essentielles et une partie appréciable des fonctions principales, il communique ces doutes au demandeur et lui donne la possibilité de les dissiper, s'applique seulement à la dernière étape du traitement des demandes. Je conviens avec le ministre que cette section ne s'applique à ni l'une ni l'autre des deux premières étapes et, comme la demande de M. Bighashi a été rejetée à la deuxième étape parce qu'elle était irrecevable aux fins de traitement, il n'y avait pas lieu d'en aviser le demandeur aux termes du guide OP 6A, comme l'alléguait le demandeur.\n[11]\nIl a également été avancé que, ayant remis en question la crédibilité de M. Bighashi, l'agent devait, par souci d'équité procédurale, en aviser le demandeur et donner à celui-ci l'occasion de s'expliquer.\n[12]\nM. Bighashi s'appuie sur la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 22, pour affirmer que l'obligation d'équité procédurale exige que les agents donnent aux demandeurs la chance d'apaiser leurs préoccupations,  même lorsque ces préoccupations découlent de la preuve qu'ils ont soumise . Toutefois, le juge Mosley a ensuite expliqué, au paragraphe 23, que l'obligation d'équité procédurale ne s'imposait pas dès que la preuve soumise soulevait une quelconque préoccupation:\nToutefois, ce principe d'équité procédurale ne va pas jusqu'à exiger que l'agent des visas fournisse au demandeur un  résultat intermédiaire  des lacunes que comporte sa demande. L'agent des visas n'est pas tenu d'informer le demandeur des questions qui découlent directement des exigences de l'ancienne Loi et de son règlement d'application [références omises].\n[13]\nBien que M. Bighashi ait décrit les réserves de l'agent comme des doutes sur sa crédibilité,\naucun élément de preuve\ndans le dossier ne révèle que la crédibilité du demandeur, ou encore l'authenticité des documents présentés, a été remise en question. Le fait que l'agent a conclu que la preuve ne suffisait pas à établir que le demandeur était comptable, selon la description du code CNP 1111, ne constitue pas une conclusion sur la crédibilité. Comme l'a déclaré le juge Muldoon, dans la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cette obligation ne prend pas simplement naissance du fait qu'après avoir soupesé la preuve l'agent des visas n'est toujours pas convaincu du bien-fondé de la demande . S'il en était autrement, chaque décision défavorable rendue dans le cadre du Programme des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral) deviendrait une conclusion défavorable sur la crédibilité dont les agents seraient tenus d'informer les demandeurs. Voilà exactement le genre de  résultat intermédiaire  non visé par l'obligation d'équité procédurale que la Cour avait envisagé dans la décision <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .\n[14]\nLa crédibilité n'étant pas remise en question, je suis d'accord avec le ministre pour dire que l'agent n'était pas tenu de donner un avis additionnel. Cette conclusion cadre avec la décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  où le juge Pinard écrit ce qui suit, au paragraphe 26:\n[...] lorsque les réserves d'un agent des visas découlent directement des exigences de la loi ou d'un règlement connexe, cet agent n'a pas l'obligation de donner au demandeur la possibilité d'y répondre (\nKaur\n, au paragraphe 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nUne expérience professionnelle pertinente est une question qui découle du règlement: un agent des visas n'est pas tenu de faire part de ses préoccupations au sujet de l'expérience professionnelle du demandeur\n((\nKaur\n, au paragraphe 12). En fin de compte, l'agent des visas n'est pas tenu de pousser ses investigations plus loin si la demande du demandeur est ambiguë:  le demandeur n'a aucun droit à l'entrevue pour cause de demande ambiguë ou d'insuffisance des pièces à l'appui  (\nKaur\n, au paragraphe 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 4).\nL'imposition d'une telle exigence équivaudrait à exiger que l'agent des visas donne préavis d'une conclusion défavorable au sujet de l'admissibilité\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 8). [Non souligné dans l'original.]\nLa décision de l'agent était-elle raisonnable?\n[15]\nAyant conclu que l'agent n'avait pas manqué à son obligation d'équité procédurale envers le demandeur, je conclus également que l'agent a estimé de façon raisonnable que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni une preuve suffisante pour établir qu'il avait accompli les tâches de comptable figurant sous le code CNP 1111. Je souscris à l'observation de l'agent selon laquelle les fonctions décrites dans la lettre d'emploi correspondaient davantage à celles d'un teneur de livres qu'à celles d'un comptable. Je rejette l'allégation de M. Bighashi voulant que sa demande ait été\névaluée\nà la lumière du code de la CNP visant la profession de teneur de livres. L'agent n'a fait qu'une simple observation. La recevabilité de la demande a été dûment évaluée à la lumière du code CNP 1111.\n[16]\nLe paragraphe 75(2) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/2002-227 [le Règlement], définit les exigences s'appliquant aux immigrants qui présentent une demande de résidence permanente au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral):\n75. (2) Est un travailleur qualifié l'étranger qui satisfait aux exigences suivantes [pendant cette période d'emploi]:\n[...]\nb) [...] il a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification;\nc) [...] il a exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession figurant dans les descriptions des professions de cette classification, notamment toutes les fonctions essentielles [...] [Non souligné dans l'original.]\n75. (2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if [during his or her employment, he or she]:\n...\n(b) ... performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification; and\n(c) ... performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification, including all of the essential duties ... [emphasis added]\n[17]\nM. Bighashi a peut-être raison de dire que les motifs de l'agent sont insuffisants parce que l'agent n'a pas défini les fonctions principales qui avaient été exercées et celles qui ne l'avaient pas été. Toutefois, il ne m'apparaît pas tout à fait évident que la description contenue dans la lettre d'emploi corresponde\nà l'une ou l'autre\ndes fonctions principales énumérées, et l'avocate n'a pas vraiment pu aider la Cour à établir des correspondances.\n[18]\nQuoi qu'il en soit, les exigences énoncées aux alinéas 75(2)\nb\n) et\nc\n) se conjuguent, et le défaut de se conformer aux exigences prévues à l'un ou l'autre de ces alinéas rend la demande irrecevable. En l'espèce, l'agent a estimé que M. Bighashi ne respectait aucune des exigences.\n[19]\nL'agent a conclu que la lettre d'emploi n'établissait pas, selon la prépondérance des probabilités, que M. Bighashi avait accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal. Aucune des responsabilités énumérées dans la lettre d'emploi ne peut être assimilée à l'examen, à l'analyse, à la planification, à l'organisation ou à l'administration de dossiers comptables et financiers. Les fonctions du demandeur se limitaient aux paiements et à la préparation de listes, de rapports et de pièces de correspondance. L'agent a exposé des motifs raisonnables à l'appui de cette conclusion.\n[20]\nM. Bighashi a demandé à l'agent de revoir sa décision et a soumis une deuxième lettre d'emploi. Cette lettre, comme il a été reconnu d'emblée, ne peut faire partie du dossier présenté à la Cour, car l'agent n'en disposait pas lorsqu'il a rendu sa décision. Elle a été produite relativement à la question d'équité pour établir que M. Bighashi aurait pu fournir des éléments de preuve montrant qu'il exerçait les fonctions de comptable s'il en avait eu l'occasion.\n[21]\nLe demandeur soutient que la deuxième lettre de son employeur décrit adéquatement les activités exposées sous le code CNP 1111. Bien que ce ne soit pas pertinent pour les besoins de la présente affaire, je constate que la fiabilité de cet élément de preuve est douteuse pour les raisons suivantes:\na) Le nom de M. Bighashi est mal orthographié (il est écrit  Bighash  au lieu de  Bighashi );\nb) La date est erronée (la lettre est datée de 2002 au lieu de 2012);\nc) La lettre énumère cinq fonctions que M. Bighashi a exercées au cours des 14 dernières années, mais aucune des fonctions indiquées dans la première lettre n'apparaît dans la deuxième - les fonctions décrites sont totalement nouvelles et différentes.\n[22]\nLa comparaison des deux lettres donne à penser que deux emplois complètement différents sont décrits. La première lettre souligne nettement le caractère administratif des fonctions de M. Bighashi, tandis que la deuxième lettre porte exclusivement sur les aspects analytiques de haut niveau du rôle de M. Bighashi. Si la deuxième lettre présente véritablement une description plus exacte des fonctions de M. Bighashi, on peut alors se demander pourquoi il aurait d'abord soumis la première lettre au lieu de demander immédiatement une lettre révisée décrivant ses fonctions réelles avec plus de précision.\n[23]\nPour les motifs exposés ci-dessus, la demande doit être rejetée. Aucune partie n'a proposé de question aux fins de certification.\nJUGEMENT\n[24]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande est rejetée. Aucune question n'est certifiée.\n[End of document]",

Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nZinn, J.\n: Mr. Bighashi applied for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He indicated in his application that he had work experience as an accountant - National Occupation Classification code 1111 [NOC 1111].\n\n[2]\nAn officer determined that his application was not eligible for processing because the officer was \"not satisfied\" that he had worked as an accountant as described in NOC 111. The officer stated that Mr. Bighashi had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he had performed \"the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation\" and that he had \"performed all of the essential duties and a substantial number of the main duties, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC.\"\n\n[3]\nIn the officer's Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes, he explains that the duties \"described in the employment letter [of the Applicant] match those of bookkeeper rather than accountant.\" The employment letter states that the Applicant:\nHas been working at Accounting Unit since Aug. 3, 2005 and as an accountant and officer responsible for preparation of expenditures and payments document [sic], has been performing the following duties and responsibilities:\n1- Payment of different forms of liabilities by check [\nsic\n].\n2- Preparing list of expenses and their documents.\n3- In charge of payment of employees loan.\n4- Preparation of different forms of inventory reports and the related correspondences.\n\n[4]\nThe lead statement of NOC 1111 states that financial auditors and accountants:\n... examine and analyze the accounting and financial records of individuals and establishments to ensure accuracy and compliance with established accounting standards and procedures ... plan, organize and administer accounting systems for individuals and establishments.\n\n[5]\nIn contrast, the lead statement of NOC 1311 states that accounting technicians and bookkeepers:\n... maintain complete sets of books, keep records of accounts, verify the procedures used for recording financial transactions, and provide personal bookkeeping services. They are employed throughout the private and public sectors, or they may be self-employed.\n\n[6]\nThe Applicant submits that:\n1. The officer breached the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice by failing to inform him about his concerns and provide him with an opportunity to address them;\n2. The officer's finding that he is a bookkeeper rather than an accountant is unreasonable; and\n3. The officer failed to provide sufficient reasons for the decision reached.\n\n[7]\nFor the reasons that follow, none of those submissions are accepted.\nWas the Duty of Fairness Breached?\n\n[8]\nThe Applicant submits that he was entitled to be informed of the officer's concerns and provided with an opportunity to address them either because of manual OP 6A - a guide provided to immigration officers for assessing federal skilled worker applications - or the jurisprudence of this Court.\n\n[9]\nI agree with the Minister that at the relevant time, there were three steps in the Ministerial Instructions in OP 6A for processing Federal Skilled Worker applications. First, the application is reviewed in a cursory manner and an initial determination made as to whether it is complete and meets the criteria in the Ministerial Instructions. Mr. Bighashi's application passed this step. If that step is passed, the applicant is asked to submit his complete application and it is referred to a visa office for a final determination of\neligibility\nfor processing. It is this step that Mr. Bighashi's application failed. It is only if the application is finally determined to be eligible for processing at step two, that the application moves to the final step where the application itself is then subject to final processing and either approved or refused.\n\n[10]\nSection 10 of OP 6A which provides that if an officer has \"any concerns about the applicant's ability or likelihood to accept and carry out the employment, they will communicate these to the applicant and provide the opportunity to respond\", and that \"where officers have concerns about whether or not the applicant has carried out 'a substantial number of main duties ... including all of the essential duties,' they should give the applicant an opportunity to respond to these concerns,\" only applies to the processing at the last step of the process. I agree with the Minister that it does not apply to either of the first two steps and, as Mr. Bighashi's application was rejected at the second step as ineligible for processing, there was no requirement for notification under OP 6A as he claimed.\n\n[11]\nIt is also submitted that a duty of procedural fairness by way of notification and an opportunity to respond was triggered because the officer brought Mr. Bighashi's credibility into question.\n\n[12]\nMr. Bighashi cites\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] at paragraph 22, for the proposition that the duty of fairness requires an officer to provide an applicant with an opportunity to disabuse the officer's concerns \"even where such concerns arise from evidence tendered by the applicant.\" However, Justice Mosley went on at paragraph 23 to explain that it is not every concern about the evidence tendered that raises such a procedural duty:\nHowever, this principle of procedural fairness does not stretch to the point of requiring that a visa officer has an obligation to provide an applicant with a \"running score\" of the weaknesses in their application. And there is no obligation on the part of a visa officer to apprise an applicant of her concerns that arise directly from the requirements of the\nformer Act\nor\nRegulations\n[references omitted].\n\n[13]\nAlthough Mr. Bighashi has framed the officer's concerns as issues with his credibility, there is\nno evidence\nin the record that his credibility was questioned, nor was the authenticity of the documents he submitted questioned. The fact that the officer found there was insufficient evidence to support the Applicant's assertion that he was an accountant, as described in NOC 1111, is not a credibility finding. As was stated by Justice Muldoon in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \"this duty does not arise merely because the visa officer has not been convinced, after weighing the evidence, that the application is well founded.\" If it were otherwise, then every negative decision under the Federal Skilled Workers Program would become a negative credibility finding requiring officers to advise applicants. This would be exactly the sort of \"running score\" process the Court in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> exempted from any fairness requirement.\n\n[14]\nSince credibility is not in issue, I agree with the Minister's submission that the officer was not required to give the Applicant additional notice. That result is consistent with the decision of Justice Pinard in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  wherein at paragraph 26, he writes:\n...where the visa officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations, he is under no duty to notify the applicant (\nKaur\nat para 11;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nRelevant work experience is a concern that arises from the regulations: a visa officer is under no duty to mention his concerns as to the applicant's work experience\n(\nKaur\nat para 12). Ultimately, the visa officer has no obligation to make inquiries where the applicant's application is ambiguous: \"there is no entitlement to an interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included\" (\nKaur\nat para 10;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 4).\nTo hold otherwise would impose on visa officers an obligation to give advance notice of a negative finding of eligibility\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at para 8). [emphasis added]\nWas the Officer's Decision Reasonable?\n\n[15]\nHaving determined that the officer did not breach the duty of fairness owed to the Applicant, I also find that the officer's conclusion that the Applicant did not submit sufficient evidence that he performed the actions required of an accountant as set out in NOC 1111, was reasonable. I agree with the officer's observation that the duties set out in the employment letter more closely matched those of the bookkeeper classification than those of an accountant. I reject the submission that Mr. Bighashi's application was\nassessed\nagainst the bookkeeper NOC code. All the officer did was to make an observation. The application was properly assessed for eligibility against NOC 1111.\n\n[16]\nSubsection 75(2) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 [\nRules\n], sets out the requirements for immigrants applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Workers class:\n75. (2) A foreign national is a skilled worker if [during his or her employment, he or she]:\n...\n(b) ... performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification; and\n(c) ... performed a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification, including all of the essential duties ... [emphasis added]\n75. (2) A foreigner is a qualified worker who meets the following requirements [during this period of employment]:\n...\nb) ... he has accomplished all of the tasks appearing in the main statement established for the profession in the descriptions of the professions of this classification;\n(c) ... he performed a significant part of the main functions of the profession listed in the descriptions of the professions of this classification, including all the essential functions ... [emphasis added]\n\n[17]\nMr. Bighashi may be correct that the officer's reasons are not adequate because of the failure to identify which of the main duties were met and which were not. However, it is not immediately obvious to me that the description in the employment letter corresponds with\nany\nof the listed main duties and counsel was not able to offer much assistance to the Court in identifying them.\n\n[18]\nIn any event, the requirements in paragraphs 75(2)(b) and (c) are joint and a failure to meet either one renders the application ineligible. In this case, the officer found that Mr. Bighashi failed to meet both of them.\n\n[19]\nThe officer found that the employment letter did not establish on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Bighashi \"performed the actions in the lead statement.\" Nothing in the listed responsibilities in the employment letter can be interpreted as examining, analyzing, planning, or organizing and administering accounting and financial records. The Applicant's duties are limited to making payments and preparing lists, reports, and correspondence. The officer's reasons for this finding are adequate and reasonable.\n\n[20]\nMr. Bighashi has asked the officer to reconsider the decision and filed a second employment letter. That letter, as was readily admitted, cannot form part of the record before this Court as it was not before the officer when he made the decision. It was tendered on the fairness issue as proof that Mr. Bighashi could have provided evidence that he was performing the duties of an accountant had he been given an opportunity to do so.\n\n[21]\nThe Applicant submits that the second letter from Mr. Bighashi's employer adequately describes the activities set out in NOC 1111. Although irrelevant for present purposes, I note that there are reasons to doubt the reliability of the evidence because:\n(a) Mr. Bighashi's name is misspelled (it is spelled \"Bighash\" instead of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> );\n(b) The date is incorrect (the letter is dated 2002 instead of 2012); and\n(c) The letter lists five duties that Mr. Bighashi has had for the past 14 years, but none of the duties listed in the first letter appear in the second letter - the described duties are entirely new and different.\n\n[22]\nComparing the second letter to the first letter leads to the view that two entirely different jobs are being described. The first letter clearly emphasizes the clerical nature of Mr. Bighashi's duties while the second letter focuses solely on the higher level analytical aspects of Mr. Bighashi's role. If the second letter truly is a more accurate description of Mr. Bighashi's duties, it begs the question of why he would have submitted the first letter instead of immediately requesting a revised version that more accurately described his actual duties.\n\n[23]\nFor these reasons the application must be dismissed. Neither party proposed a question for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[24]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\nthe application is dismissed and no question is certified.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Bighashi has applied for permanent residence in Canada under the Federal Skilled Worker category. In his application, he indicated that he had work experience as an accountant - National Occupational Classification code 1111 [NOC code 1111].",
