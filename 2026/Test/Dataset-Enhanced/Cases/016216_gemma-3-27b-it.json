    "[1]\nMuldoon, J.\n: This matter is part of a sequence of litigation between the parties, and others, arising from the plaintiff's unjust dismissal from the defendant's employ. The other litigation arises under suit no. T-493-92, in which were impleaded Derek Booth, an adjudicator appointed pursuant to s. 242 of the\nCanada Labour Code\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2, as amended, and the federal Minister of Labour. The Department of Justice representing the Minister sought no part of that litigation and the Minister was excused therefrom.",
    "[2]\nThe adjudicator's order, dated March 9, 1992, reified his decision dated January 15, 1992, and was filed in this court on March 16, 1992. It was so filed herein pursuant to s. 244 of the\nLabour Code\n. It was certified, and so, registered on March 17, 1992, and pursuant to s. 244(2), it\n\"... when registered, has the same force and effect, and all proceedings may be taken thereon, as if the order were a judgment obtained in that [Federal] court.\"\nNo objection having been taken, the court counts the time elapsed after the date of the decision until the date of the order's filing to be adequate compliance with both the letter and the intent of s. 244(1), because as a result of the other litigious matter earlier above mentioned, ample proof was placed before the court at the merged hearing on April 7, 1992, in Winnipeg, that the order was effectively made by the adjudicator in the text and terms of his decision.",
    "[3]\nThe order of the adjudicator runs as follows:\n\"Upon the complaint of the complainant for unjust dismissal under the\nCanada Labour Code\n, which complaint was heard by me at the Town of Dauphin, in Manitoba, on December 9, 1991, and in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba, on December 11, 1991;\n\"And Upon hearing evidence submitted by the respondent and the complainant and what was alleged by counsel;\n\"It Is Hereby Ordered that:\n1.

    "[4]\nTwo motions have been presented to the court by the plaintiff (judgment creditor) and one by the defendant (judgment debtor). Eliminating motions for abridgment of time, accepted by the respective parties on consent, the defendant's notice of motion, in its pertinent parts, runs:\n\"2. An order staying execution of the decision of Adjudicator Booth dated January 15, 1992, in respect of which an order was signed by Adjudicator Booth on March 9, 1992 which order was filed in the Federal Court of Canada on March 17, 1992, on such terms and on such conditions as may be just.\n\"3. An order setting aside the Garnishing Order issued against Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited on March 25, 1992.\n\"4. In the alternative an order relieving Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited of its obligations to comply with a Garnishing Order dated March 25, 1992 on such terms and conditions as may be just.\n\"5. In the further alternative an order requiring the plaintiff to provide satisfactory evidence to this court of her ability to repay the sum of $129,011.68 in the event the application for review of the decision of Adjudicator Booth is successful in whole or in part.\n\"6. In the further alternative, and as a condition of this court granting the order for payment out requested by the plaintiff in her notice of motion, dated April 2, 1992, an order requiring the plaintiff to post security for the repayment some or all of the $129.011.68 to be paid out.\n. . . . .\n\"The Grounds For This Motion Are:\n. . . . .\n2. There is pending in this court as Suit No. T-493-92 an application by West Region Tribal Council to quash, set aside and declare invalid the decision of Adjudicator Booth dated January 15, 1992.\n3. There are special circumstances which render it inexpedient to enforce the judgment resulting from the decision of Adjudicator Booth.\n4. Sections 1909 and 2100 of the\nRules\nare relied upon.\"\nThis motion is stated to be supported by the affidavit of Clifford McKay, but is, in fact, supported by Thomas Nepinak's affidavit sworn and filed herein on April 6, 1992.",
    "[5]\nMr. Nepinak notes that in that other litigation, suit no. T-493-92, the defendant (judgment debtor) (hereinafter sometimes called the defendant, or the W.R.T.C.) had applied \"to quash, set aside and declare invalid the decision of Adjudicator Booth\", whose effect \"was to require WRTC to pay to Debbie Kostyshyn the sum of $129,011.68\". Mr. Nepinak, in his affidavit makes no reference to the nonmonetary provision in the adjudicator's decision and order, made to clear Ms. Johnson's reputation as a competent employee \"in terms no less favourable than her employee evaluation\", by means of \"a letter of reference to be provided to [her] by February 1, 1992\".",
    "[6]\nMr. Nepinak's main concerns are expressed in paragraph 5 through 10 of his affidavit, thus:\n\"5. I am concerned that in the event that Debbie Kostyshyn is able to recover the amount of $129,011.68 by way of garnishment [she has already done so] ... and subsequently the decision of Adjudicator Booth is overturned in whole or in part, WRTC may be unable to recover the amount which may have been previously collected by way of garnishment or execution by Debbie Kostyshyn. I am unaware of Debbie Kostyshyn's financial situation or her assets and liabilities or the extent to which she would be in a position to repay any amount she may have collected.\n\"6. I am concerned with the impact which the removal of $129,011.68 will have on WRTC. WRTC is an organization which represents the interests of nine First Nations located in Western Manitoba which are the Crane River, Ebb and Flow, Gamblers, Pine Creek, Rolling River, Valley River, Waterhen, Waywayseecappo and Keeseekoowenin Nations. WRTC provides programming to the member Nations, and their residents in the health education and community development fields which programming is provided on behalf of the government of Canada.\n\"7. WRTC derives all of its funding from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, a department of the federal government. WRTC must negotiate with the federal government each year with respect to the amount of funding it is to receive. The budgeted amounts reflect the needs of WRTC to cover its overhead and to provide the various programs and services which it provides to its member Nations. Once the budgets are approved funding agreements are entered into which cannot be changed except through a renegotiation of the agreements.\n\"8. WRTC receives its funding in monthly instalments which are deposited to its bank by the federal government. The amounts received each month are received in accordance with the budgets reflected in the funding agreements. The result is that the monies received each month are committed to specific expenditure items.\n\"9. The funds which have been garnished and are to be paid into court are funds which are committed to specific expenditures. If these funds are not available to WRTC then WRTC will potentially have to delay payment of bills it has received, lay off staff, reduce or suspend the secondary and/or post secondary education programs the cost of which is approximately $150,000 per month and delay the implementation of programs run by each of the Nations which receive their funds through WRTC.\n\"10. The source of whatever funds may ultimately be required to be paid to Debbie Kostyshyn will be the Government of Canada through Indian and Northern Affairs.\"",
    "[7]\nThe matter of the validity of the adjudicator's decision, and consequent order, has been resolved in favour of validity by the court's dismissal of the W.R.T.C.'s attacks upon it, in suit no. T-493-92. The plaintiff (judgment creditor), Ms. Johnson, has been, and is free to enforce the monetary aspect of the order by garnishment, and in fact, she thereby captured the full monetary award of $129,011.68. The letter of reference remained outstanding and owing to her as of the date of the hearing before this court.",
    "[8]\nMr. Nepinak, on behalf of the W.R.T.C. however, is concerned that, if the adjudicator's order were to be invalidated after the successful garnishment of some or all of the monetary award, and if the money were paid over to the judgment creditor, she might be unable (presumably having spent it all) to disgorge it for restitution to the W.R.T.C. This concern would have the public place no reliance on first-instance decisions and orders in that, it seems to mean, successful litigants at first instance should not be able to touch the fruits of their victories unless and until such victories be confirmed on appeal. Life is full of risks, and the risk of the known appellate system is litigious and emotional whiplash, and will always be so unless one or other instance of litigation be abolished and all curial tribunals be composed of an odd number of judges, being three or more. So invalidation upon appeal is a risk.",
    "[9]\nShould the risk operate against the poor, against those of modest means, and against those whose means are proportionately small compared with their adversaries' means? One may find one, admittedly imperfect, but proximate analogy in security for costs, rule 446. The rule must be applied precisely according to its criteria in rules 446(1)(a) to (d):\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 39 F.T.R. 90 (T.D.). In the case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 737; 71 Alta. L.R.(2d) 445, this court dismissed a motion for security for costs because it would have effectively prevented the plaintiffs, unemployed students from pursuing the action. Again, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 272; 22 C.I.P.R. 295, this court adhered strictly to the criteria expressed in rules 446(1)(a) through (d) and held that it is not sufficient to prove that the other party is insolvent or has a weak case.",
    "[10]\nNow, it is true that security for possible prospective costs, is not within the certainty of the award's certain sum, which was the W.R.T.C.'s money, and it is true that there is a chance that the adjudicator's decision and order might yet be invalidated on appeal. But in view of the judgment debtor's admission before the adjudicator of its unjust dismissal of the judgment creditor from its employ, it is difficult to rationalize why she should be prevented from instant payment out of the great bulk, if not all, of the garnished money. If any of the money were to be retained in court, it should be only about 15 percent to meet the remote contingency of upset on appeal. But, why should the court impose compulsory prudence, and compulsory savings, upon the judgment creditor, as if she were an incompetent who could not assess the contingencies for herself? No good reason for that is shown.",
    "[11]\nMr. Nepinak also expresses concern for the West Region Tribal Council Inc., the judgment debtor, of which he is a board member, that the impact of the garnishment of the $129,011.68 will have on its \"programming ... in the health education and community development fields\". When that consideration is raised, the usual reply is that the board ought to have thought of that matter before it dismissed the judgment creditor unjustly. Like all other corporations, this corporation must bear the usual responsibility for its board's misdeeds. Unfortunately, according to Mr. Nepinak's paragraph 6, it is ultimately the taxpayers of Canada who will pay for the board's misdeeds. Paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 deserve the same response. Now the judgment debtor is \"crying the blues\" about its budgeted programs, but of course, it deserves no more sympathy than any other judgment debtor in the same sort of self-inflicted plight.",
    "[12]\nHowever, even in \"crying the blues\" the board member may be ill-informed, or perhaps even dissembling more than a little. Here is some good news for the W.R.T.C. provided by none other than the judgment creditor, herself. Paragraph 9 of Ms. Johnson's affidavit, sworn April 6, 1992, runs thus:\n\"9. In my capacity as Finance Officer while employed by the defendant, I was involved in preparation of internal budgets, negotiation of funding and was aware of funds received by the defendant and manner of disbursement of funds, and the processing of annual\nCorporations Act\nof Manitoba returns. The defendant is a federally incorporated nonshare corporation registered under the Manitoba\nCorporations Act\n. While I was employed by the defendant and at the time of my dismissal in January of 1991, the defendant received funding not only from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs of Canada but also from the Department of Health and Welfare (Canada) Medical Services and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. At the time of my dismissal by the defendant the defendant's budget contained a category entitled 'band support' also known as 'administration' of about $500,000 which fund had in the past been used to pay damage awards for unjust dismissal as well as legal costs of resisting such claims. The aforesaid administrative fund was not necessarily committed to specific expenditures. The funds which I have caused to be garnished in this matter can be charged to the said administrative fund.\"\nIt appears that no sympathy whatever is due to the W.R.T.C., just to the taxpayers of Canada, but even that factor will not persuade this court to set aside the garnishing order as the W.R.T.C.'s counsel pleaded that it be so done. That plea in ineffective.",
    "[13]\nThe seemingly major plea made on behalf of the W.R.T.C.'s avoidance of the garnishing order is founded upon ss. 89 and 90 of the\nIndian Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. Those provisions enact the following:\n\"89(1) Subject to this Act, the real and personal property of an\nIndian\nor a\nband\nsituated on a reserve is [sic] not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.\n\"89(1.1) [... leasehold interest - not applicable]\n\"89(2) [... conditional sales - not applicable]\n\"90(1) For the purposes of ss. 87 [taxation exemption - not applicable] and 89, personal property that was\n(a) purchased by her Majesty with Indian moneys or moneys appropriated by Parliament for the use and benefit of Indians or bands, or\n(b) given to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> or to a\nband\nunder a treaty or agreement between a band and Her Majesty,\nshall be deemed always to be situated on a reserve.\n\"90(2) Every transaction purporting to pass title to any property that is by this section deemed to be situated on a reserve, or any interest in such property, is void unless the transaction is entered into with the consent of the Minister or is entered into between members of a band or between the band and member thereof.\n\"90(3) Every person who enters into any transaction that is void by virtue of subsection (2) is guilty of an offence, and every person who, without the written consent of the Minister, destroys personal property that is by this section deemed to be situated on a reserve is guilty of an offence.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\nSo, argues the judgment debtor's counsel, the judgment creditor cannot lawfully touch any of the garnished moneys - personal property, which it is - because, deemed under s. 90(1) always to be situated on a reserve, it \"is not subject to attachment ... seizure ... or execution in favour or at the instance of\" the judgment creditor, Johnson.",
    "[14]\nThe simple and clear answer to this contention is that the judgment debtor, the West Region Tribal Council Inc. is neither an Indian nor a band: it is a corporation. The affidavit of Mr. Nepinak alleges that the W.R.T.C. \"is an organization which represents the interests of nine First Nations located in Western Manitoba which are ...\" (para. 6); and the affidavit of Ms. Johnson, sworn April 6, 1992, alleges that the W.R.T.C. \"is a federally incorporated nonshare corporation registered under the Manitoba\nCorporations Act\n\" (para. 9, recited in full earlier herein).",
    "[15]\nIn Woodward\nNative Law\n, Carswell 1989, it is stated at page 6: \"A corporation cannot be considered to be an Indian within the meaning of s. 91(24)\" of the\nConstitution Act 1867\n. This statement is elucidated by the following footnote:\n\"29\nRe Stony Plain Indian Reserve No. 135\n, [1982] 1 W.W.R. 302 (Alta. C.A.). Nor can a corporation be considered an Indian within the meaning of the\nIndian Act\n: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 1 Sask. R. 179n, discussed below.\"\nThen, in the same textbook, it is stated on p. 7:\n\"... In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, all of the shareholders of a corporation were Indians, but the court found that the corporation itself was not an Indian. Accordingly, even though all of the shareholders would have enjoyed the exemption from tax afforded by the\nIndian Act\nif they had remained unincorporated, [their] incorporated business was required to pay tax.\n\"[See also\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Alta. C.A.), and\nFour B  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  finds the following:\n\"A band does not have corporate status. [\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  band. Even if a corporation has its registered office on an Indian reserve and is owned by shareholders, all of whom are registered Indians and band members residing on an Indian reserve, the corporation is not a band.\"",
    "[16]\nHaving reviewed the jurisprudence cited in the above recited passages in Woodward's\nNative Law\n, the court accepts those passages as authoritative statements of the law. The defendant's counsel cited\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  are not pertinent here.",
    "[17]\nAccordingly, ss. 89 and 90 of the\nIndian Act\ndo not operate so as to exempt from garnishment the W.R.T.C. Inc.'s account on deposit with the Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited, because the W.R.T.C. is neither an Indian nor an Indian band.",
    "[18]\nIn these proceedings, the plaintiff (judgment creditor) has moved the court to pronounce certain orders, thus:\n\"1. An order for directions as to the procedure to be followed in determining whether or not an appointment of a receiver should be made pursuant to paragraph 2 hereof.\n[The written consent of Lazer Grant + Company Ltd. to being appointed receiver is filed.]\n\"2. An order for the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution of all funds payable to the defendant by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, until the within judgment is paid in full.\"\nThe need for a receiver is now transcended because of the execution of the garnishing order whereby the adjudicator's judgment in monetary terms is indeed paid in full.",
    "[19]\nThe plaintiff (judgment creditor) also seeks a further and other order, as follows:\n\"2. An order for payment out to the solicitor for the plaintiff of such monies as are paid into this Honourable Court by the Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited, the garnishee;\"\nIn support of the above application is filed the affidavit, sworn April 2, 1992, of Debbie Kostyshyn (Johnson), the plaintiff (judgment creditor), who avers, in paragraph 7, that she supports the granting of an order in nearly exactly the above terms, that is \"payment out to my lawyers\" instead of \"to the solicitor for the plaintiff\".",
    "[20]\nThe court finds that there is no legal reason for denying Ms. Johnson access to her award for unjust dismissal, according to her instructions. An order shall be issued to confirm all of the conclusions formulated herein, including payment out of the sum captured through the garnishment process, as sought. The W.R.T.C. shall pay to the plaintiff (judgment creditor) her full party and party costs of and incidental to these proceedings, including a full second counsel fee.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms\n[End of document]"

The plaintiff (judgment creditor), Ms. Johnson, has been, and is free to enforce the monetary aspect of the order by garnishment, and in fact, she thereby captured the full monetary award of $129,011.68. The letter of reference remained outstanding and owing to her as of the date of the hearing before this court.\n[8]\nMr. Nepinak, on behalf of the W.R.T.C. however, is concerned that, if the adjudicator's order were to be invalidated after the successful garnishment of some or all of the monetary award, and if the money were paid over to the judgment creditor, she might be unable (presumably having spent it all) to disgorge it for restitution to the W.R.T.C. This concern would have the public place no reliance on first-instance decisions and orders in that, it seems to mean, successful litigants at first instance should not be able to touch the fruits of their victories unless and until such victories be confirmed on appeal. Life is full of risks, and the risk of the known appellate system is litigious and emotional whiplash, and will always be so unless one or other instance of litigation be abolished and all curial tribunals be composed of an odd number of judges, being three or more. So invalidation upon appeal is a risk.\n[9]\nShould the risk operate against the poor, against those of modest means, and against those whose means are proportionately small compared with their adversaries' means? One may find one, admittedly imperfect, but proximate analogy in security for costs, rule 446. The rule must be applied precisely according to its criteria in rules 446(1)(a) to (d):\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 39 F.T.R. 90 (T.D.). In the case of\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 737; 71 Alta. L.R.(2d) 445, this court dismissed a motion for security for costs because it would have effectively prevented the plaintiffs, unemployed students from pursuing the action. Again, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 272; 22 C.I.P.R. 295, this court adhered strictly to the criteria expressed in rules 446(1)(a) through (d) and held that it is not sufficient to prove that the other party is insolvent or has a weak case.\n[10]\nNow, it is true that security for possible prospective costs, is not within the certainty of the award's certain sum, which was the W.R.T.C.'s money, and it is true that there is a chance that the adjudicator's decision and order might yet be invalidated on appeal. But in view of the judgment debtor's admission before the adjudicator of its unjust dismissal of the judgment creditor from its employ, it is difficult to rationalize why she should be prevented from instant payment out of the great bulk, if not all, of the garnished money. If any of the money were to be retained in court, it should be only about 15 percent to meet the remote contingency of upset on appeal. But, why should the court impose compulsory prudence, and compulsory savings, upon the judgment creditor, as if she were an incompetent who could not assess the contingencies for herself? No good reason for that is shown.\n[11]\nMr. Nepinak also expresses concern for the West Region Tribal Council Inc., the judgment debtor, of which he is a board member, that the impact of the garnishment of the $129,011.68 will have on its \"programming ... in the health education and community development fields\". When that consideration is raised, the usual reply is that the board ought to have thought of that matter before it dismissed the judgment creditor unjustly. Like all other corporations, this corporation must bear the usual responsibility for its board's misdeeds. Unfortunately, according to Mr. Nepinak's paragraph 6, it is ultimately the taxpayers of Canada who will pay for the board's misdeeds. Paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 deserve the same response. Now the judgment debtor is \"crying the blues\" about its budgeted programs, but of course, it deserves no more sympathy than any other judgment debtor in the same sort of self-inflicted plight.\n[12]\nHowever, even in \"crying the blues\" the board member may be ill-informed, or perhaps even dissembling more than a little. Here is some good news for the W.R.T.C. provided by none other than the judgment creditor, herself. Paragraph 9 of Ms. Johnson's affidavit, sworn April 6, 1992, runs thus:\n\"9. In my capacity as Finance Officer while employed by the defendant, I was involved in preparation of internal budgets, negotiation of funding and was aware of funds received by the defendant and manner of disbursement of funds, and the processing of annual\nCorporations Act\nof Manitoba returns. The defendant is a federally incorporated nonshare corporation registered under the Manitoba\nCorporations Act\n. While I was employed by the defendant and at the time of my dismissal in January of 1991, the defendant received funding not only from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs of Canada but also from the Department of Health and Welfare (Canada) Medical Services and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. At the time of my dismissal by the defendant the defendant's budget contained a category entitled 'band support' also known as 'administration' of about $500,000 which fund had in the past been used to pay damage awards for unjust dismissal as well as legal costs of resisting such claims. The aforesaid administrative fund was not necessarily committed to specific expenditures. The funds which I have caused to be garnished in this matter can be charged to the said administrative fund.\"\nIt appears that no sympathy whatever is due to the W.R.T.C., just to the taxpayers of Canada, but even that factor will not persuade this court to set aside the garnishing order as the W.R.T.C.'s counsel pleaded that it be so done. That plea in ineffective.\n[13]\nThe seemingly major plea made on behalf of the W.R.T.C.'s avoidance of the garnishing order is founded upon ss. 89 and 90 of the\nIndian Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. Those provisions enact the following:\n\"89(1) Subject to this Act, the real and personal property of an\nIndian\nor a\nband\nsituated on a reserve is [sic] not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band.\n\"89(1.1) [... leasehold interest - not applicable]\n\"89(2) [... conditional sales - not applicable]\n\"90(1) For the purposes of ss. 87 [taxation exemption - not applicable] and 89, personal property that was\n(a) purchased by her Majesty with Indian moneys or moneys appropriated by Parliament for the use and benefit of Indians or bands, or\n(b) given to <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> or to a\nband\nunder a treaty or agreement between a band and Her Majesty,\nshall be deemed always to be situated on a reserve.\n\"90(2) Every transaction purporting to pass title to any property that is by this section deemed to be situated on a reserve, or any interest in such property, is void unless the transaction is entered into with the consent of the Minister or is entered into between members of a band or between the band and member thereof.\n\"90(3) Every person who enters into any transaction that is void by virtue of subsection (2) is guilty of an offence, and every person who, without the written consent of the Minister, destroys personal property that is by this section deemed to be situated on a reserve is guilty of an offence.\" (Emphasis not in original text)\nSo, argues the judgment debtor's counsel, the judgment creditor cannot lawfully touch any of the garnished moneys - personal property, which it is - because, deemed under s. 90(1) always to be situated on a reserve, it \"is not subject to attachment ... seizure ... or execution in favour or at the instance of\" the judgment creditor, Johnson.\n[14]\nThe simple and clear answer to this contention is that the judgment debtor, the West Region Tribal Council Inc. is neither an Indian nor a band: it is a corporation. The affidavit of Mr. Nepinak alleges that the W.R.T.C. \"is an organization which represents the interests of nine First Nations located in Western Manitoba which are ...\" (para. 6); and the affidavit of Ms. Johnson, sworn April 6, 1992, alleges that the W.R.T.C. \"is a federally incorporated nonshare corporation registered under the Manitoba\nCorporations Act\n\" (para. 9, recited in full earlier herein).\n[15]\nIn Woodward\nNative Law\n, Carswell 1989, it is stated at page 6: \"A corporation cannot be considered to be an Indian within the meaning of s. 91(24)\" of the\nConstitution Act 1867\n. This statement is elucidated by the following footnote:\n\"29\nRe Stony Plain Indian Reserve No. 135\n, [1982] 1 W.W.R. 302 (Alta. C.A.). Nor can a corporation be considered an Indian within the meaning of the\nIndian Act\n: see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 1 Sask. R. 179n, discussed below.\"\nThen, in the same textbook, it is stated on p. 7:\n\"... In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, all of the shareholders of a corporation were Indians, but the court found that the corporation itself was not an Indian. Accordingly, even though all of the shareholders would have enjoyed the exemption from tax afforded by the\nIndian Act\nif they had remained unincorporated, [their] incorporated business was required to pay tax.\n\"[See also\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Alta.

Even if a corporation has its registered office on an Indian reserve and is owned by shareholders, all of whom are registered Indians and band members residing on an Indian reserve, the corporation is not a band.\"\n[16]\nHaving reviewed the jurisprudence cited in the above recited passages in Woodward's\nNative Law\n, the court accepts those passages as authoritative statements of the law. The defendant's counsel cited\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.) and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  are not pertinent here.\n[17]\nAccordingly, ss. 89 and 90 of the\nIndian Act\ndo not operate so as to exempt from garnishment the W.R.T.C. Inc.'s account on deposit with the Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited, because the W.R.T.C. is neither an Indian nor an Indian band.\n[18]\nIn these proceedings, the plaintiff (judgment creditor) has moved the court to pronounce certain orders, thus:\n\"1. An order for directions as to the procedure to be followed in determining whether or not an appointment of a receiver should be made pursuant to paragraph 2 hereof.\n[The written consent of Lazer Grant + Company Ltd. to being appointed receiver is filed.]\n\"2. An order for the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution of all funds payable to the defendant by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, until the within judgment is paid in full.\"\nThe need for a receiver is now transcended because of the execution of the garnishing order whereby the adjudicator's judgment in monetary terms is indeed paid in full.\n[19]\nThe plaintiff (judgment creditor) also seeks a further and other order, as follows:\n\"2. An order for payment out to the solicitor for the plaintiff of such monies as are paid into this Honourable Court by the Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited, the garnishee;\"\nIn support of the above application is filed the affidavit, sworn April 2, 1992, of Debbie Kostyshyn (Johnson), the plaintiff (judgment creditor), who avers, in paragraph 7, that she supports the granting of an order in nearly exactly the above terms, that is \"payment out to my lawyers\" instead of \"to the solicitor for the plaintiff\".\n[20]\nThe court finds that there is no legal reason for denying Ms. Johnson access to her award for unjust dismissal, according to her instructions. An order shall be issued to confirm all of the conclusions formulated herein, including payment out of the sum captured through the garnishment process, as sought. The W.R.T.C. shall pay to the plaintiff (judgment creditor) her full party and party costs of and incidental to these proceedings, including a full second counsel fee.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nMuldoon, J.\n: This matter is part of a sequence of litigation between the parties, and others, arising from the plaintiff's unjust dismissal from the defendant's employ. The other litigation arises under suit no. T-493-92, in which were impleaded Derek Booth, an adjudicator appointed pursuant to s. 242 of the\nCanada Labour Code\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2, as amended, and the federal Minister of Labour. The Department of Justice representing the Minister sought no part of that litigation and the Minister was excused therefrom.\n\n[2]\nThe adjudicator's order, dated March 9, 1992, reified his decision dated January 15, 1992, and was filed in this court on March 16, 1992. It was so filed herein pursuant to s. 244 of the\nLabour Code\n. It was certified, and so, registered on March 17, 1992, and pursuant to s. 244(2), it\n\"... when registered, has the same force and effect, and all proceedings may be taken thereon, as if the order were a judgment obtained in that [Federal] court.\"\nNo objection having been taken, the court counts the time elapsed after the date of the decision until the date of the order's filing to be adequate compliance with both the letter and the intent of s. 244(1), because as a result of the other litigious matter earlier above mentioned, ample proof was placed before the court at the merged hearing on April 7, 1992, in Winnipeg, that the order was effectively made by the adjudicator in the text and terms of his decision.\n\n[3]\nThe order of the adjudicator runs as follows:\n\"Upon the complaint of the complainant for unjust dismissal under the\nCanada Labour Code\n, which complaint was heard by me at the Town of Dauphin, in Manitoba, on December 9, 1991, and in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba, on December 11, 1991;\n\"And Upon hearing evidence submitted by the respondent and the complainant and what was alleged by counsel;\n\"It Is Hereby Ordered that:\n1.

During this period of eight years and three months, her work for the organization was excellent. She is a self-starter who is extremely capable of working independently. Her self-acquired knowledge of the Tribal Council's operations and her personal dedication to our organization will be greatly missed by our office. I would recommend Debbie for any position she set her sights on. Her dedication, determination and professionalism would be a welcomed asset by any company seeking to be the best in their field.\nYours truly,\nDennis WhiteBird, Chairman\nWest Region Tribal Council\nBoard of Directors\"\nAs of the date of the hearing in Winnipeg, on April 7, 1992, the defendant had made no compliance whatever with the above judgment order. The plaintiff (judgment creditor) had, however, garnished the judgment debtor's account with the Dauphin Plains Credit Union, in the amount of $129,011.68, which sum reposes in the hands of the Receiver General of Canada.\n\n[4]\nTwo motions have been presented to the court by the plaintiff (judgment creditor) and one by the defendant (judgment debtor). Eliminating motions for abridgment of time, accepted by the respective parties on consent, the defendant's notice of motion, in its pertinent parts, runs:\n\"2. An order staying execution of the decision of Adjudicator Booth dated January 15, 1992, in respect of which an order was signed by Adjudicator Booth on March 9, 1992 which order was filed in the Federal Court of Canada on March 17, 1992, on such terms and on such conditions as may be just.\n\"3. An order setting aside the Garnishing Order issued against Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited on March 25, 1992.\n\"4. In the alternative an order relieving Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited of its obligations to comply with a Garnishing Order dated March 25, 1992 on such terms and conditions as may be just.\n\"5. In the further alternative an order requiring the plaintiff to provide satisfactory evidence to this court of her ability to repay the sum of $129,011.68 in the event the application for review of the decision of Adjudicator Booth is successful in whole or in part.\n\"6. In the further alternative, and as a condition of this court granting the order for payment out requested by the plaintiff in her notice of motion, dated April 2, 1992, an order requiring the plaintiff to post security for the repayment some or all of the $129.011.68 to be paid out.\n. . . . .\n\"The Grounds For This Motion Are:\n. . . . .\n2. There is pending in this court as Suit No. T-493-92 an application by West Region Tribal Council to quash, set aside and declare invalid the decision of Adjudicator Booth dated January 15, 1992.\n3. There are special circumstances which render it inexpedient to enforce the judgment resulting from the decision of Adjudicator Booth.\n4. Sections 1909 and 2100 of the\nRules\nare relied upon.\"\nThis motion is stated to be supported by the affidavit of Clifford McKay, but is, in fact, supported by Thomas Nepinak's affidavit sworn and filed herein on April 6, 1992.\n\n[5]\nMr. Nepinak notes that in that other litigation, suit no. T-493-92, the defendant (judgment debtor) (hereinafter sometimes called the defendant, or the W.R.T.C.) had applied \"to quash, set aside and declare invalid the decision of Adjudicator Booth\", whose effect \"was to require WRTC to pay to Debbie Kostyshyn the sum of $129,011.68\". Mr. Nepinak, in his affidavit makes no reference to the nonmonetary provision in the adjudicator's decision and order, made to clear Ms. Johnson's reputation as a competent employee \"in terms no less favourable than her employee evaluation\", by means of \"a letter of reference to be provided to [her] by February 1, 1992\".\n\n[6]\nMr. Nepinak's main concerns are expressed in paragraph 5 through 10 of his affidavit, thus:\n\"5. I am concerned that in the event that Debbie Kostyshyn is able to recover the amount of $129,011.68 by way of garnishment [she has already done so] ... and subsequently the decision of Adjudicator Booth is overturned in whole or in part, WRTC may be unable to recover the amount which may have been previously collected by way of garnishment or execution by Debbie Kostyshyn. I am unaware of Debbie Kostyshyn's financial situation or her assets and liabilities or the extent to which she would be in a position to repay any amount she may have collected.\n\"6. I am concerned with the impact which the removal of $129,011.68 will have on WRTC. WRTC is an organization which represents the interests of nine First Nations located in Western Manitoba which are the Crane River, Ebb and Flow, Gamblers, Pine Creek, Rolling River, Valley River, Waterhen, Waywayseecappo and Keeseekoowenin Nations. WRTC provides programming to the member Nations, and their residents in the health education and community development fields which programming is provided on behalf of the government of Canada.\n\"7. WRTC derives all of its funding from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, a department of the federal government. WRTC must negotiate with the federal government each year with respect to the amount of funding it is to receive. The budgeted amounts reflect the needs of WRTC to cover its overhead and to provide the various programs and services which it provides to its member Nations. Once the budgets are approved funding agreements are entered into which cannot be changed except through a renegotiation of the agreements.\n\"8. WRTC receives its funding in monthly instalments which are deposited to its bank by the federal government. The amounts received each month are received in accordance with the budgets reflected in the funding agreements. The result is that the monies received each month are committed to specific expenditure items.\n\"9. The funds which have been garnished and are to be paid into court are funds which are committed to specific expenditures. If these funds are not available to WRTC then WRTC will potentially have to delay payment of bills it has received, lay off staff, reduce or suspend the secondary and/or post secondary education programs the cost of which is approximately $150,000 per month and delay the implementation of programs run by each of the Nations which receive their funds through WRTC.\n\"10. The source of whatever funds may ultimately be required to be paid to Debbie Kostyshyn will be the Government of Canada through Indian and Northern Affairs.\"\n\n[7]\nThe matter of the validity of the adjudicator's decision, and consequent order, has been resolved in favour of validity by the court's dismissal of the W.R.T.C.'s attacks upon it, in suit no.

An order for directions as to the procedure to be followed in determining whether or not an appointment of a receiver should be made pursuant to paragraph 2 hereof.\n[The written consent of Lazer Grant + Company Ltd. to being appointed receiver is filed.]\n\"2. An order for the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution of all funds payable to the defendant by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, until the within judgment is paid in full.\"\nThe need for a receiver is now transcended because of the execution of the garnishing order whereby the adjudicator's judgment in monetary terms is indeed paid in full.\n\n[19]\nThe plaintiff (judgment creditor) also seeks a further and other order, as follows:\n\"2. An order for payment out to the solicitor for the plaintiff of such monies as are paid into this Honourable Court by the Dauphin Plains Credit Union Limited, the garnishee;\"\nIn support of the above application is filed the affidavit, sworn April 2, 1992, of Debbie Kostyshyn (Johnson), the plaintiff (judgment creditor), who avers, in paragraph 7, that she supports the granting of an order in nearly exactly the above terms, that is \"payment out to my lawyers\" instead of \"to the solicitor for the plaintiff\".\n\n[20]\nThe court finds that there is no legal reason for denying Ms. Johnson access to her award for unjust dismissal, according to her instructions. An order shall be issued to confirm all of the conclusions formulated herein, including payment out of the sum captured through the garnishment process, as sought. The W.R.T.C. shall pay to the plaintiff (judgment creditor) her full party and party costs of and incidental to these proceedings, including a full second counsel fee.\nOrder accordingly.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/sms\n[End of document]",

    "factual_background": [
      "A plaintiff, Debbie Johnson, initiated litigation against a defendant, West Region Tribal Council (W.R.T.C.), alleging unjust dismissal from employment.",
      "An adjudicator issued a decision on January 15, 1992, and a formal order on March 9, 1992, awarding Johnson $103,286.50 plus costs and a letter of reference.",
      "The adjudicator's order was filed with the Federal Court on March 16, 1992, and registered on March 17, 1992, acquiring the force of a court judgment.",
      "The W.R.T.C. did not initially comply with the adjudicator's order.",
      "Johnson garnished funds from the W.R.T.C.'s account at Dauphin Plains Credit Union, resulting in $129,011.68 being held by the Receiver General of Canada.",
      "The W.R.T.C. initiated a separate legal action (Suit No. T-493-92) to challenge the adjudicator's decision.",
      "The W.R.T.C. expressed concern about its ability to repay the judgment if the adjudicator's decision were overturned on appeal.",
      "The W.R.T.C. is funded by the Canadian federal government through Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and relies on these funds for programming and operations.",
      "Johnson, while employed by the W.R.T.C., was aware of a dedicated 'band support' fund that had been used to cover previous dismissal awards.",
      "The W.R.T.C. argued that funds were potentially protected from seizure under sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act, as they were deemed to be situated on a reserve.",
      "The court determined that the W.R.T.C., as a corporation, was not an 'Indian' or a 'band' as defined by the Indian Act and therefore the Act's protections did not apply."

    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The adjudicator's order should be enforced, and the garnished funds ($129,011.68) should be paid out to satisfy the judgment.",
        "The West Region Tribal Council (W.R.T.C.) is not entitled to a stay of execution or to have the garnishing order set aside.",
        "The W.R.T.C.'s concerns about being unable to repay the funds if the adjudicator's decision is overturned on appeal are speculative and do not justify preventing enforcement of the judgment.",
        "The W.R.T.C. has an internal fund ('band support' or 'administration') that could be used to cover the judgment without impacting its programs.",
        "Sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act do not apply to the W.R.T.C. because it is a corporation, not an Indian or a band.",
        "Appointment of a receiver to collect funds from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs is necessary to ensure full payment of the judgment (though this became moot with the garnishment).",
        "Solicitor's fees should be paid from the garnished funds."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The execution of the adjudicator's order should be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal in suit no. T-493-92, where the W.R.T.C. is challenging the decision.",
        "The garnishing order should be set aside or the Dauphin Plains Credit Union should be relieved of its obligations under it.",
        "Alternatively, the applicant (Johnson) should be required to provide security to repay the $129,011.68 if the adjudicator's decision is overturned on appeal.",
        "Enforcing the judgment will have a severe negative impact on the W.R.T.C.'s ability to provide programs and services to its member First Nations, potentially leading to layoffs and program cuts.",
        "The W.R.T.C.'s funding is derived from the federal government and is allocated to specific expenditures; the garnished funds are committed to those expenditures.",
        "Sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act protect the W.R.T.C.'s funds from attachment, seizure, or execution because the funds are deemed to be situated on a reserve."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court affirmed the validity of the adjudicator’s order for unjust dismissal, noting that challenges to the order in a related case (T-493-92) had been dismissed, and the order had been properly registered, giving it the force of a court judgment.",
      "The court rejected the defendant’s (West Region Tribal Council - WRTC) request to stay execution of the order and set aside the garnishment, finding no basis to prevent the plaintiff (Debbie Johnson) from accessing the funds awarded to her.",
      "The court dismissed the argument that sections 89 and 90 of the Indian Act shielded the funds from garnishment, reasoning that the WRTC, as a corporation, is neither an “Indian” nor a “band” as defined by the Act, and therefore the exemption did not apply. The court relied on established jurisprudence (Woodward Native Law and cited cases) confirming that corporations cannot be considered ‘Indians’ for the purposes of the Indian Act.",
      "The court found no justification for delaying payment to the plaintiff, despite the WRTC’s concerns about its financial stability and potential need to repay the funds if the adjudicator’s decision were overturned on appeal. The court noted the inherent risk in the appellate process and saw no reason to impose 'compulsory prudence' on the plaintiff.",
      "The court acknowledged the WRTC’s claim that the funds were earmarked for specific programs but dismissed it, stating that the corporation was responsible for the consequences of its unjust dismissal of the plaintiff and that the taxpayers of Canada ultimately bear the cost of the WRTC’s actions.",
      "The court granted the plaintiff’s motion for payment of the garnished funds to her solicitor and awarded her full party and party costs, including a second counsel fee."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The defendant's application to stay execution of the adjudicator's order was denied.",
      "The defendant's application to set aside the garnishing order was denied.",
      "The defendant's application for relief from the garnishing order was denied.",
      "The plaintiff's application for directions regarding the appointment of a receiver was rendered moot.",
      "The plaintiff's application for payment of funds from the garnishment to her solicitor was granted.",
