    "[0]\nDate:\n20160628\nDocket: IMM-5429-15\nCitation:\n2016 FC 728\nOttawa, Ontario, June 28, 2016\nPRESENT: The\nHonourable Madam Justice Kane\nBETWEEN:\nSVITLANA KIVALO\nAND IVAN KIVALO\nApplicant\nand\nMINISTER OF\nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nRespondent\nJUDGMENT AND REASONS",
    "[1]\nThe applicants, Svitlana Kivalo and her son,\nseek judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the Immigration and Refugee\nProtection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act] of the decision of the Refugee\nAppeal Division [RAD] dated November 16, 2015, which dismissed their appeal of\nthe decision of the Refugee Protection Board [RPD] and confirmed that they were\nnot Convention refugees.",
    "[2]\nThe applicants claimed refugee status on the\nbasis of Ms. Kivalos fear of abuse from her ex-common law partner, Igor. The\nRAD found that Ms. Kivalos account of her relationship with Igor was not\ncredible in light of all the evidence and that her delay in claiming protection\ndetracted from her credibility. The RAD also agreed with the RPDs finding that\nMs. Kivalo was generally lacking in credibility, a finding which extended to\nall parts of her testimony.",
    "[3]\nOn judicial review, the applicants submit that\nthe RAD did not sufficiently assess the evidence and simply deferred to the\nRPDs microscopic analysis, resulting in unreasonable credibility findings, and\nthat the evidence as a whole supports Ms. Kivalos account of abuse by Igor.",
    "[4]\nFor the reasons that follow, the application is\ndismissed. The RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence as\nrequired and made reasonable credibility findings. It was reasonable for the\nRAD to defer to the RPDs credibility findings on issues where the RPD had an\nadvantage in hearing the applicants testimony and explanations.\nI.\nBackground",
    "[5]\nThe applicants are citizens of Ukraine. They\narrived in Canada in June 2014 on valid visas, which were extended and\neventually expired on April 3, 2015. They sought refugee protection in March\n2015.",
    "[6]\nThe applicants claim is based on a fear of risk\nand harm of domestic violence by Ms. Kivalos ex-common law partner, Igor. Ms.\nKivalo recounts that she met Igor soon after her husband died in 2006. She\nmarried Igor in a church wedding within the year following her husbands death.\nShe explains that it is not considered appropriate to engage in a new\nrelationship so quickly and the marriage was never registered with the state.",
    "[7]\nMs. Kivalo claims that Igor became abusive in\n2008 and recounts physical and sexual assaults.",
    "[8]\nIn June 2014, Ms. Kivalo left Ukraine with her\nyoungest son. Her teenage children remained in Ukraine with her sister. The\napplicants arrived in Canada on temporary visas which were later renewed to\nfacilitate their departure from Canada. They then claimed refugee protection in\nMarch 2015, claiming that Igor had threatened Ms. Kivalo and attacked her\nsister in February 2015.\nThe RPD decision",
    "[9]\nThe RPD found that Ms. Kivalo was not a credible\nwitness due to several omissions and inconsistencies in her basis of claim\n[BOC] form, which were not reasonably explained; the lack of any persuasive\nevidence regarding her relationship with Igor; and, the delay in claiming\nprotection until her temporary visa was about to expire.",
    "[10]\nThe RPD concluded that the documents provided by\nMs. Kivalo to corroborate her claim did not overcome the credibility concerns.\nThe RPD noted that:\nThe residence\ncertificate indicates that Igor is a cohabitant, but does not establish\nhis relationship to Ms. Kivalo or that he was abusive.\nThe medical\nbooklets were handwritten and their author could not be verified. Ms.Kivalos\nmedical report for her injuries in Ukraine only contained information that\nshe provided and she was not credible. Her sisters medical report did not\ncontain information about Igor.\nThe police\nresponses provided were not accompanied by police reports and lacked details.\nThe RPD rejected Ms. Kivalos explanation that she thought it was only\nimportant to state that Igor beat her, not to provide the details.",
    "[11]\nThe RPD found that on a balance of probabilities\nthe documents provided were false or fraudulent and attached no weight to them.",
    "[12]\nThe RPD noted the hallmarks of a credibility\nassessment, including omissions, inconsistency and vagueness, and concluded\nthat Ms. Kivalo was generally lacking in credibility, a finding which extended\nto all relevant parts of her testimony.\nII.\nThe Decision Under Review",
    "[13]\nThe RAD stated that it would follow the Federal\nCourts decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [Huruglica FC] and\nconduct an independent assessment of the evidence, affording deference to the\nRPDs findings on issues of credibility or to other findings where the RPD had\nan advantage in reaching its conclusions.",
    "[14]\nThe RAD questioned the credibility of the\nalleged relationship between Ms. Kivalo and Igor as no documentation was\nprovided to establish its existence. The RAD found that, although Igor and Ms.\nKivalo were not legally married, their relationship would be reasonably\nexpected to be noted on the residence certificate.",
    "[15]\nThe RAD also agreed with the RPD that it was not\ncredible that Ms. Kivalo would have omitted her common law partner from her\nCanadian visa applications, including the extension applications. Ms. Kivalo\nhad lived with Igor for several years as his common law spouse and, although\nthe marriage had not been registered, the visa application requires that all\ncommon law relationships be listed.",
    "[16]\nThe RAD found the lack of documentation\nregarding the church marriage and years of cohabitation to be compelling.",
    "[17]\nWith respect to Ms. Kivalos testimony and lack\nof awareness about Igors use of his patrimonial name, which the RPD had found\nto be the basis of a negative credibility inference, the RAD also found this to\nbe an indication that her description of her relationship and abuse by Igor was\nnot credible.",
    "[18]\nThe RAD concluded, on a balance of\nprobabilities, that Ms. Kivalo did not have the relationship she alleged.",
    "[19]\nThe RAD did not agree with the RPDs finding\nthat the medical documents were fraudulent. However, assuming the medical\ndocumentation was genuine, the RAD found that it did not establish or\ncorroborate that Igor was the cause of Ms. Kivalos injuries, noting that it\nwas Ms. Kivalo who told the medical personnel that Igor was the cause. With\nrespect to her sisters injuries, the RAD noted that there was no mention on\nthe document of who caused the injuries. It was only Ms. Kivalo who stated that\nIgor caused the injuries and she was not credible.",
    "[20]\nThe RAD agreed with the RPDs findings regarding\nthe police responses. The RAD noted that the September 2012 request for police\nintervention lacked details and Ms. Kivalos explanation was not credible. The\nRAD also found that the lack of police reports to substantiate the\ninvestigations and measures taken was compelling. Given the credibility\nfindings, the RAD gave no weight to the police documents as proof that Igor was\nthe abuser or that the events occurred as Ms. Kivalo described.",
    "[21]\nThe RAD also agreed with the RPDs finding that Ms.\nKivalos delay in claiming protection did not demonstrate subjective fear of\nher situation in Ukraine. She only made a claim for refugee protection when faced\nwith expulsion from Canada.\nIII.\nThe Issues",
    "[22]\nThe sole issue is whether the decision of the\nRAD is reasonable.",
    "[23]\nThe applicants argue that the RPD erred in its\nassessment of the evidence and in deferring to the findings of the RPD\nregarding the applicants credibility.\nIV.\nThe Standard of Review",
    "[24]\nThe RAD is tasked with conducting an appeal of\nthe RPDs decision. The Court conducts a judicial review of the RADs decision.",
    "[25]\nIn the recent decision Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2016]\nFCJ No 313 (QL) [Huruglica FCA], Justice Gauthier clarified the\nuncertainty regarding the standard of review to be applied by the RAD; the RAD\nshould fulfill its appellate role and apply the standard of correctness when\nreviewing RPD decision.",
    "[26]\nWith respect to deference owed to the RPDs\ncredibility findings, Huruglica FCA does not dictate a single standard\nof review. Justice Gauthier described several scenarios at paras 6973 to\nhighlight the situations where the RAD should consider deference to the RPD\nand, alternatively, where the RAD should be cautious in substituting its\ndecision.",
    "[27]\nJustice Gauthier noted at para 70, that with\nrespect to whether deference is owed to the RPD: In\neach case, the RAD ought to determine whether the RPD truly benefited from an\nadvantageous position, and if so, whether the RAD can nevertheless make a final\ndecision in respect of the refugee claim. Justice Gauthier added at\npara 74: The RAD should be given the opportunity to\ndevelop its own jurisprudence in that respect; there is thus no need for me to\npigeon-hole the RAD to the level of deference owed in each case.",
    "[28]\nIn the present case, the RAD did not have the\nbenefit of the Court of Appeals decision and was guided by the decision of\nthis Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC. However, the requirement for an independent\nassessment of the evidence confirmed by the Court of Appeal was established in\nthe Federal Courts decision. The RAD indicated that it would conduct an\nindependent assessment and would defer to the RPD on its credibility findings\nwhere the RPD enjoyed an advantage.",
    "[29]\nThe RADs determinations of factual issues,\nincluding credibility, and issues of mixed fact and law are also reviewed on the\nreasonableness standard.",
    "[30]\nThe reasonableness standard focuses on the existence of justification, transparency and\nintelligibility within the decision-making process and considers whether the decision falls within a range of possible,\nacceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The\nCourt will not re-weigh the evidence or re-make the decision.\nV.\nThe Applicants Submissions",
    "[31]\nThe applicants argue that there was sufficient\ncredible evidence to support their allegations and that the RAD deferred to the\nRPDs microscopic analysis and did not consider that cumulatively, the evidence\nsupports Ms. Kivalos account of abuse by Igor. In particular, the RAD erred in\ndiscounting the corroborative evidence, including the medical booklet, due to\nits credibility findings and erred in finding that Ms. Kivalos delay in\nclaiming refugee protection demonstrated lack of subjective fear.",
    "[32]\nThe applicants submit that the RAD erred by\nfinding Ms. Kivalos testimony to not be credible without considering the\nmedical documentation as relevant corroborating evidence. The applicants point\nto the notations regarding her injuries that were contemporaneous with her\naccount of abuse, including several abortions that Igor forced her to undergo.",
    "[33]\nThe applicants add that the RAD unreasonably\ndismissed the police evidence which corroborates that Ms. Kivalo did make a\ncomplaint to the police of abuse by Igor.",
    "[34]\nThe applicants argue that the corroborating\ndocuments should have been assessed and considered by the RAD before it made\nits credibility findings, rather than simply deferring to the RPD.\nCorroborating documents cannot be discounted because of the credibility\nconcerns about an applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 367 (QL)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[35]\nThe applicants submit that it was unreasonable\nto draw negative credibility findings from the fact that Igor is listed as a\ncohabitant rather than as a common-law spouse on the residence certificate\ngiven that common-law relationships are not accepted in Ukraine. Moreover, the\nresidence certificate was not tendered to establish the relationship, only that\nIgor lived in her house.",
    "[36]\nThe applicants also argue that their delay in\nclaiming refugee protection did not demonstrate lack of subjective fear. They\nwere legally in Canada on visas which were extended up to March 2015 and they\nwere not at risk of returning to Ukraine at that time.\nVI.\nThe Respondents Submissions",
    "[37]\nThe respondent submits that the RAD conducted an\nindependent assessment of the evidence and the subsequent decision of the\nFederal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FCA does not change the\nreasonableness of its analysis.",
    "[38]\nThe respondent notes that the RAD deferred to\nseveral of the RPDs findings, particularly on issues where the RPD had an\nadvantage, including the omissions and inconsistency in Ms.Kivalos\ntestimony before the RPD and the RPDs rejection of her explanations. The RAD\nalso conducted an independent assessment of the documentary evidence and\nreached the same conclusions as the RPD, with the exception of the genuineness\nof the medical booklet.",
    "[39]\nThe respondent notes that the RAD acknowledged\nthat common law relationships are not recognized in Ukraine, yet reasonably\nfound that Igor would be listed as something other than a cohabitant if Ms.\nKivalo and Igor had a church wedding and resided together for over five years.\nThe respondent notes that Ms. Kivalo did not refrain from naming her current common\nlaw partner on her more recent application for a visitors visa.",
    "[40]\nThe respondent disputes the applicants\nsubmission that cumulatively, the evidence supports only the conclusion that\nMs. Kivalos injuries were caused by Igor. Although the RAD did not find that\nthe medical booklet was fraudulent, it was open to the RAD to conclude that the\nmedical documentation did not verify that Igor was the cause of Ms. Kivalos\ninjuries or those of her sister, given that she reported her injuries to\nmedical personnel and her sisters document did not indicate the name of the\nperson who caused the injury.",
    "[41]\nThe respondent submits that the RAD did not err\nby discounting the medical booklet or the police reports tendered as\ncorroborating evidence. The respondent distinguishes Kabongo; in that\ncase the RPD gave no weight to an arrest warrant, which was an independent\ncorroborative document of the information provided by the applicant. A medical\nreport does not necessarily corroborate an applicants allegations where the\nreport depends on the credibility and trustworthiness of the information\nprovided by an applicant to the medical professional.",
    "[42]\nThe respondent adds that the RAD was entitled to\ntake into account the applicants delay in claiming refugee status, along with\nthe other factors it considered. The RAD reasonably concluded that Ms. Kivalo\nhad not demonstrated subjective fear of her situation in Ukraine which impacts\nher credibility.\nVII.\nThe Decision is Reasonable",
    "[43]\nThe RAD conducted an independent assessment of\nthe evidence on the record and deferred to several of the credibility findings\nof the RPD. As noted above, the RPD found Ms.Kivalos testimony\ninconsistent, some of her accounts to be implausible, several omissions in her\nBOC and her explanations to be unreasonable. The RAD reasonably found that the\nRPD had not erred in its credibility findings or other findings, with the\nexception of its finding that the medical documentation could be fraudulent.",
    "[44]\nI do not agree that the RAD simply deferred to\nthe RPDs analysis; the RAD conducted an independent assessment of all the\nevidence and deferred to the RPD where appropriate, based on the RPDs\nadvantage in hearing the applicants testimony, responses to questions and\nexplanations.",
    "[45]\nMs. Kivalo argued that the medical records of\nher injuries, combined with the evidence of the police response, which could\nonly be a response to her reports of violence by Igor, along with her other\nevidence leads only to the conclusion that she suffered the domestic abuse she\nrecounted. However, the RAD reasonably found that there was no sufficient or\ncredible evidence of Ms. Kivalos marriage or common law relationship with\nIgor.",
    "[46]\nAlthough it may not have been possible for Ms.\nKivalo to list Igor as a common law partner on her residence certificate, the\nresidence certificate could still not assist in establishing any relationship\nwith Igor. As noted by the RPD and RAD, the certificate was issued to and\nlisted Ms. Kivalos teenage daughter as the applicant for the certificate. The\nRAD did not err in questioning the residence certificate.",
    "[47]\nWith respect to the applicants argument that\nthe RAD erred in discounting the medical evidence due to its credibility\nconcerns, rather than considering the corroborative evidence first and then\ndetermining the credibility of the applicant, I agree with the respondent that Kabongo\ncan be distinguished.",
    "[48]\nIn Kabongo, Justice Rennie found that the\nRPD erred by failing to consider that the applicants testimony was\ncorroborated by a warrant for his arrest. Justice Rennie found: [t]he warrant was itself highly relevant to the credibility\nof his testimony. The Board cannot find the applicants testimony not credible\nwithout consideration of relevant corroborative evidence, and then subsequently\nreject the supporting evidence because of the credibility finding.",
    "[49]\nIn the present case, the RAD found that Ms.\nKivalo was not credible, and then found that her medical booklet which reported\nher injuries and Igor as the abuser to be not credible. The RAD did not fail to\nconsider the medical booklet. However, the medical booklets reference to Igor\nas the cause of her injuries (or some of her injuries) is not independent\nevidence, as is an arrest warrant. Ms. Kivalos statement to medical personnel\nthat Igor caused her injuries, therefore, cannot corroborate her other\naccounts, which the RAD considered and found not credible, that Igor caused her\ninjuries. The RAD made many credibility findings against Ms. Kivalo and her\ncredibility cannot be rehabilitated by relying on her own discredited account.",
    "[50]\nAs noted by the respondent, the jurisprudence\nhas cautioned that the recounting of events to medical personnel does not make\nthese events more credible and that the resulting medical report cannot confirm\nallegations of abuse For example, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 53 ACWS (3d) 371 (FCTD), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL),\n44 ACWS (3d) 766 (FCTD), the Court noted that opinion evidence is only as valid\nas the truth of the facts upon which it is based.",
    "[51]\nSimilarly, the RAD reasonably gave little weight\nto the police responses to Ms. Kivalos complaints. The documents, which were\nnot police reports, were insufficient to establish that Igor was the abuser or\nthat the events occurred as alleged.",
    "[52]\nThe RAD did not err in finding that Ms. Kivalos\ndelay in claiming refugee protection demonstrated lack of subjective fear.",
    "[53]\nJustice Zinn provided a helpful summary of the\nlaw regarding delay in claiming protection in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1368 (QL), noting\nat para 21 that delay may be a valid factor to consider, but delay does not\nautomatically result in a finding of lack of subjective fear. The circumstances\nand explanations for the delay must be considered. At paras 22-23, Justice Zinn\nnoted the jurisprudence that established the principle that having temporary\nstatus in Canada and not being subject to immediate removal was not a sufficient\nexplanation for a delay in failing to make a refugee claim, but he found that\nthe circumstances of the temporary status must be considered to determine\nwhether this shows a lack of subjective fear.",
    "[54]\nIn the present case, the RAD considered Ms.\nKivalos explanation for her delay in claiming protection and found that it was\nnot reasonable. Ms. Kivalo had come to Canada on a temporary visa which was\nextended at least twice, the last time to permit her to return to Ukraine on a\nparticular date as planned. Ms. Kivalo did not mention Igor in any of her visa\napplications or extension applications. She did not make a refugee claim naming\nIgor as her common law partner or abuser until faced with the requirement to\nleave Canada.",
    "[55]\nWith respect to the applicants submission that,\ncumulatively, there was sufficient evidence to support Ms. Kivalos account of\nabuse by Igor, I do not agree that the RAD failed to properly assess Ms.\nKivalos credibility in the context of all the evidence. The RAD made many\ncredibility findings, including related to Ms. Kivalos failure to name Igor on\nthe visa applications, her lack of awareness of Igors patrimonial name, the\nabsence of any documentation of a relationship with Igor and her delay in\nclaiming refugee protection. None of these findings related to evidence which\ncould corroborate that she was in a relationship with Igor or that Igor was the\ncause of her injuries.",
    "[56]\nWhile the applicants argue that there was no\nother reasonable conclusion, the RAD reasonably found otherwise. The RAD also\ndeferred to the RPD, based on its assessment of Ms. Kivalos testimony and the\ndocumentary evidence, which went so far as to find that she was generally\nlacking in credibility, which extended to all aspects of her claim.",
    "[57]\nThe jurisprudence in the context of judicial\nreviews of RPD decisions and those of other tribunals that have heard the\ntestimony and assessed the credibility of an applicant guides the Court to show\nsignificant deference to such findings ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 1329 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 924\n(QL)). I see no reason to take a different approach to credibility findings\nconfirmed by the RAD following its independent assessment of the evidence on\nthe record or where the RAD defers to the RPD based on its assessment.\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURTS JUDGMENT is that the\napplication for judicial review is dismissed.\nThere\nis no question for certification.\n\"Catherine M.

The\nRAD found that Ms. Kivalos account of her relationship with Igor was not\ncredible in light of all the evidence and that her delay in claiming protection\ndetracted from her credibility. The RAD also agreed with the RPDs finding that\nMs. Kivalo was generally lacking in credibility, a finding which extended to\nall parts of her testimony.\n[3]\nOn judicial review, the applicants submit that\nthe RAD did not sufficiently assess the evidence and simply deferred to the\nRPDs microscopic analysis, resulting in unreasonable credibility findings, and\nthat the evidence as a whole supports Ms. Kivalos account of abuse by Igor.\n[4]\nFor the reasons that follow, the application is\ndismissed. The RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence as\nrequired and made reasonable credibility findings. It was reasonable for the\nRAD to defer to the RPDs credibility findings on issues where the RPD had an\nadvantage in hearing the applicants testimony and explanations.\nI.\nBackground\n[5]\nThe applicants are citizens of Ukraine. They\narrived in Canada in June 2014 on valid visas, which were extended and\neventually expired on April 3, 2015. They sought refugee protection in March\n2015.\n[6]\nThe applicants claim is based on a fear of risk\nand harm of domestic violence by Ms. Kivalos ex-common law partner, Igor. Ms.\nKivalo recounts that she met Igor soon after her husband died in 2006. She\nmarried Igor in a church wedding within the year following her husbands death.\nShe explains that it is not considered appropriate to engage in a new\nrelationship so quickly and the marriage was never registered with the state.\n[7]\nMs. Kivalo claims that Igor became abusive in\n2008 and recounts physical and sexual assaults.\n[8]\nIn June 2014, Ms. Kivalo left Ukraine with her\nyoungest son. Her teenage children remained in Ukraine with her sister. The\napplicants arrived in Canada on temporary visas which were later renewed to\nfacilitate their departure from Canada. They then claimed refugee protection in\nMarch 2015, claiming that Igor had threatened Ms. Kivalo and attacked her\nsister in February 2015.\nThe RPD decision\n[9]\nThe RPD found that Ms. Kivalo was not a credible\nwitness due to several omissions and inconsistencies in her basis of claim\n[BOC] form, which were not reasonably explained; the lack of any persuasive\nevidence regarding her relationship with Igor; and, the delay in claiming\nprotection until her temporary visa was about to expire.\n[10]\nThe RPD concluded that the documents provided by\nMs. Kivalo to corroborate her claim did not overcome the credibility concerns.\nThe RPD noted that:\nThe residence\ncertificate indicates that Igor is a cohabitant, but does not establish\nhis relationship to Ms. Kivalo or that he was abusive.\nThe medical\nbooklets were handwritten and their author could not be verified.

The RAD found that, although Igor and Ms.\nKivalo were not legally married, their relationship would be reasonably\nexpected to be noted on the residence certificate.\n[15]\nThe RAD also agreed with the RPD that it was not\ncredible that Ms. Kivalo would have omitted her common law partner from her\nCanadian visa applications, including the extension applications. Ms. Kivalo\nhad lived with Igor for several years as his common law spouse and, although\nthe marriage had not been registered, the visa application requires that all\ncommon law relationships be listed.\n[16]\nThe RAD found the lack of documentation\nregarding the church marriage and years of cohabitation to be compelling.\n[17]\nWith respect to Ms. Kivalos testimony and lack\nof awareness about Igors use of his patrimonial name, which the RPD had found\nto be the basis of a negative credibility inference, the RAD also found this to\nbe an indication that her description of her relationship and abuse by Igor was\nnot credible.\n[18]\nThe RAD concluded, on a balance of\nprobabilities, that Ms. Kivalo did not have the relationship she alleged.\n[19]\nThe RAD did not agree with the RPDs finding\nthat the medical documents were fraudulent.

Justice Gauthier added at\npara 74: The RAD should be given the opportunity to\ndevelop its own jurisprudence in that respect; there is thus no need for me to\npigeon-hole the RAD to the level of deference owed in each case.\n[28]\nIn the present case, the RAD did not have the\nbenefit of the Court of Appeals decision and was guided by the decision of\nthis Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC. However, the requirement for an independent\nassessment of the evidence confirmed by the Court of Appeal was established in\nthe Federal Courts decision. The RAD indicated that it would conduct an\nindependent assessment and would defer to the RPD on its credibility findings\nwhere the RPD enjoyed an advantage.\n[29]\nThe RADs determinations of factual issues,\nincluding credibility, and issues of mixed fact and law are also reviewed on the\nreasonableness standard.\n[30]\nThe reasonableness standard focuses on the existence of justification, transparency and\nintelligibility within the decision-making process and considers whether the decision falls within a range of possible,\nacceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The\nCourt will not re-weigh the evidence or re-make the decision.\nV.\nThe Applicants Submissions\n[31]\nThe applicants argue that there was sufficient\ncredible evidence to support their allegations and that the RAD deferred to the\nRPDs microscopic analysis and did not consider that cumulatively, the evidence\nsupports Ms. Kivalos account of abuse by Igor. In particular, the RAD erred in\ndiscounting the corroborative evidence, including the medical booklet, due to\nits credibility findings and erred in finding that Ms. Kivalos delay in\nclaiming refugee protection demonstrated lack of subjective fear.\n[32]\nThe applicants submit that the RAD erred by\nfinding Ms. Kivalos testimony to not be credible without considering the\nmedical documentation as relevant corroborating evidence. The applicants point\nto the notations regarding her injuries that were contemporaneous with her\naccount of abuse, including several abortions that Igor forced her to undergo.\n[33]\nThe applicants add that the RAD unreasonably\ndismissed the police evidence which corroborates that Ms. Kivalo did make a\ncomplaint to the police of abuse by Igor.\n[34]\nThe applicants argue that the corroborating\ndocuments should have been assessed and considered by the RAD before it made\nits credibility findings, rather than simply deferring to the RPD.\nCorroborating documents cannot be discounted because of the credibility\nconcerns about an applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 367 (QL)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[35]\nThe applicants submit that it was unreasonable\nto draw negative credibility findings from the fact that Igor is listed as a\ncohabitant rather than as a common-law spouse on the residence certificate\ngiven that common-law relationships are not accepted in Ukraine. Moreover, the\nresidence certificate was not tendered to establish the relationship, only that\nIgor lived in her house.\n[36]\nThe applicants also argue that their delay in\nclaiming refugee protection did not demonstrate lack of subjective fear. They\nwere legally in Canada on visas which were extended up to March 2015 and they\nwere not at risk of returning to Ukraine at that time.\nVI.\nThe Respondents Submissions\n[37]\nThe respondent submits that the RAD conducted an\nindependent assessment of the evidence and the subsequent decision of the\nFederal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FCA does not change the\nreasonableness of its analysis.\n[38]\nThe respondent notes that the RAD deferred to\nseveral of the RPDs findings, particularly on issues where the RPD had an\nadvantage, including the omissions and inconsistency in Ms.Kivalos\ntestimony before the RPD and the RPDs rejection of her explanations. The RAD\nalso conducted an independent assessment of the documentary evidence and\nreached the same conclusions as the RPD, with the exception of the genuineness\nof the medical booklet.\n[39]\nThe respondent notes that the RAD acknowledged\nthat common law relationships are not recognized in Ukraine, yet reasonably\nfound that Igor would be listed as something other than a cohabitant if Ms.\nKivalo and Igor had a church wedding and resided together for over five years.\nThe respondent notes that Ms. Kivalo did not refrain from naming her current common\nlaw partner on her more recent application for a visitors visa.\n[40]\nThe respondent disputes the applicants\nsubmission that cumulatively, the evidence supports only the conclusion that\nMs. Kivalos injuries were caused by Igor. Although the RAD did not find that\nthe medical booklet was fraudulent, it was open to the RAD to conclude that the\nmedical documentation did not verify that Igor was the cause of Ms. Kivalos\ninjuries or those of her sister, given that she reported her injuries to\nmedical personnel and her sisters document did not indicate the name of the\nperson who caused the injury.\n[41]\nThe respondent submits that the RAD did not err\nby discounting the medical booklet or the police reports tendered as\ncorroborating evidence. The respondent distinguishes Kabongo; in that\ncase the RPD gave no weight to an arrest warrant, which was an independent\ncorroborative document of the information provided by the applicant. A medical\nreport does not necessarily corroborate an applicants allegations where the\nreport depends on the credibility and trustworthiness of the information\nprovided by an applicant to the medical professional.\n[42]\nThe respondent adds that the RAD was entitled to\ntake into account the applicants delay in claiming refugee status, along with\nthe other factors it considered. The RAD reasonably concluded that Ms. Kivalo\nhad not demonstrated subjective fear of her situation in Ukraine which impacts\nher credibility.\nVII.\nThe Decision is Reasonable\n[43]\nThe RAD conducted an independent assessment of\nthe evidence on the record and deferred to several of the credibility findings\nof the RPD. As noted above, the RPD found Ms.Kivalos testimony\ninconsistent, some of her accounts to be implausible, several omissions in her\nBOC and her explanations to be unreasonable. The RAD reasonably found that the\nRPD had not erred in its credibility findings or other findings, with the\nexception of its finding that the medical documentation could be fraudulent.\n[44]\nI do not agree that the RAD simply deferred to\nthe RPDs analysis; the RAD conducted an independent assessment of all the\nevidence and deferred to the RPD where appropriate, based on the RPDs\nadvantage in hearing the applicants testimony, responses to questions and\nexplanations.\n[45]\nMs. Kivalo argued that the medical records of\nher injuries, combined with the evidence of the police response, which could\nonly be a response to her reports of violence by Igor, along with her other\nevidence leads only to the conclusion that she suffered the domestic abuse she\nrecounted. However, the RAD reasonably found that there was no sufficient or\ncredible evidence of Ms. Kivalos marriage or common law relationship with\nIgor.\n[46]\nAlthough it may not have been possible for Ms.\nKivalo to list Igor as a common law partner on her residence certificate, the\nresidence certificate could still not assist in establishing any relationship\nwith Igor. As noted by the RPD and RAD, the certificate was issued to and\nlisted Ms. Kivalos teenage daughter as the applicant for the certificate. The\nRAD did not err in questioning the residence certificate.\n[47]\nWith respect to the applicants argument that\nthe RAD erred in discounting the medical evidence due to its credibility\nconcerns, rather than considering the corroborative evidence first and then\ndetermining the credibility of the applicant, I agree with the respondent that Kabongo\ncan be distinguished.\n[48]\nIn Kabongo, Justice Rennie found that the\nRPD erred by failing to consider that the applicants testimony was\ncorroborated by a warrant for his arrest. Justice Rennie found: [t]he warrant was itself highly relevant to the credibility\nof his testimony. The Board cannot find the applicants testimony not credible\nwithout consideration of relevant corroborative evidence, and then subsequently\nreject the supporting evidence because of the credibility finding.\n[49]\nIn the present case, the RAD found that Ms.\nKivalo was not credible, and then found that her medical booklet which reported\nher injuries and Igor as the abuser to be not credible. The RAD did not fail to\nconsider the medical booklet. However, the medical booklets reference to Igor\nas the cause of her injuries (or some of her injuries) is not independent\nevidence, as is an arrest warrant. Ms. Kivalos statement to medical personnel\nthat Igor caused her injuries, therefore, cannot corroborate her other\naccounts, which the RAD considered and found not credible, that Igor caused her\ninjuries. The RAD made many credibility findings against Ms. Kivalo and her\ncredibility cannot be rehabilitated by relying on her own discredited account.\n[50]\nAs noted by the respondent, the jurisprudence\nhas cautioned that the recounting of events to medical personnel does not make\nthese events more credible and that the resulting medical report cannot confirm\nallegations of abuse For example, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 53 ACWS (3d) 371 (FCTD), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL),\n44 ACWS (3d) 766 (FCTD), the Court noted that opinion evidence is only as valid\nas the truth of the facts upon which it is based.\n[51]\nSimilarly, the RAD reasonably gave little weight\nto the police responses to Ms. Kivalos complaints. The documents, which were\nnot police reports, were insufficient to establish that Igor was the abuser or\nthat the events occurred as alleged.\n[52]\nThe RAD did not err in finding that Ms. Kivalos\ndelay in claiming refugee protection demonstrated lack of subjective fear.\n[53]\nJustice Zinn provided a helpful summary of the\nlaw regarding delay in claiming protection in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1368 (QL), noting\nat para 21 that delay may be a valid factor to consider, but delay does not\nautomatically result in a finding of lack of subjective fear. The circumstances\nand explanations for the delay must be considered. At paras 22-23, Justice Zinn\nnoted the jurisprudence that established the principle that having temporary\nstatus in Canada and not being subject to immediate removal was not a sufficient\nexplanation for a delay in failing to make a refugee claim, but he found that\nthe circumstances of the temporary status must be considered to determine\nwhether this shows a lack of subjective fear.\n[54]\nIn the present case, the RAD considered Ms.\nKivalos explanation for her delay in claiming protection and found that it was\nnot reasonable. Ms. Kivalo had come to Canada on a temporary visa which was\nextended at least twice, the last time to permit her to return to Ukraine on a\nparticular date as planned. Ms. Kivalo did not mention Igor in any of her visa\napplications or extension applications. She did not make a refugee claim naming\nIgor as her common law partner or abuser until faced with the requirement to\nleave Canada.\n[55]\nWith respect to the applicants submission that,\ncumulatively, there was sufficient evidence to support Ms. Kivalos account of\nabuse by Igor, I do not agree that the RAD failed to properly assess Ms.\nKivalos credibility in the context of all the evidence. The RAD made many\ncredibility findings, including related to Ms. Kivalos failure to name Igor on\nthe visa applications, her lack of awareness of Igors patrimonial name, the\nabsence of any documentation of a relationship with Igor and her delay in\nclaiming refugee protection. None of these findings related to evidence which\ncould corroborate that she was in a relationship with Igor or that Igor was the\ncause of her injuries.\n[56]\nWhile the applicants argue that there was no\nother reasonable conclusion, the RAD reasonably found otherwise. The RAD also\ndeferred to the RPD, based on its assessment of Ms. Kivalos testimony and the\ndocumentary evidence, which went so far as to find that she was generally\nlacking in credibility, which extended to all aspects of her claim.\n[57]\nThe jurisprudence in the context of judicial\nreviews of RPD decisions and those of other tribunals that have heard the\ntestimony and assessed the credibility of an applicant guides the Court to show\nsignificant deference to such findings ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 1329 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 924\n(QL)). I see no reason to take a different approach to credibility findings\nconfirmed by the RAD following its independent assessment of the evidence on\nthe record or where the RAD defers to the RPD based on its assessment.\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURTS JUDGMENT is that the\napplication for judicial review is dismissed.\nThere\nis no question for certification.\n\"Catherine M.

  "full_text_en": "[0]\nDate:\n20160628\nDocket: IMM-5429-15\nCitation:\n2016 FC 728\nOttawa, Ontario, June 28, 2016\nPRESENT: The\nHonourable Madam Justice Kane\nBETWEEN:\nSVITLANA KIVALO\nAND IVAN KIVALO\nApplicant\nand\nMINISTER OF\nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nRespondent\nJUDGMENT AND REASONS\n\n[1]\nThe applicants, Svitlana Kivalo and her son,\nseek judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the Immigration and Refugee\nProtection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act] of the decision of the Refugee\nAppeal Division [RAD] dated November 16, 2015, which dismissed their appeal of\nthe decision of the Refugee Protection Board [RPD] and confirmed that they were\nnot Convention refugees.\n\n[2]\nThe applicants claimed refugee status on the\nbasis of Ms. Kivalos fear of abuse from her ex-common law partner, Igor. The\nRAD found that Ms. Kivalos account of her relationship with Igor was not\ncredible in light of all the evidence and that her delay in claiming protection\ndetracted from her credibility. The RAD also agreed with the RPDs finding that\nMs. Kivalo was generally lacking in credibility, a finding which extended to\nall parts of her testimony.\n\n[3]\nOn judicial review, the applicants submit that\nthe RAD did not sufficiently assess the evidence and simply deferred to the\nRPDs microscopic analysis, resulting in unreasonable credibility findings, and\nthat the evidence as a whole supports Ms. Kivalos account of abuse by Igor.\n\n[4]\nFor the reasons that follow, the application is\ndismissed. The RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence as\nrequired and made reasonable credibility findings. It was reasonable for the\nRAD to defer to the RPDs credibility findings on issues where the RPD had an\nadvantage in hearing the applicants testimony and explanations.\nI.\nBackground\n\n[5]\nThe applicants are citizens of Ukraine. They\narrived in Canada in June 2014 on valid visas, which were extended and\neventually expired on April 3, 2015. They sought refugee protection in March\n2015.\n\n[6]\nThe applicants claim is based on a fear of risk\nand harm of domestic violence by Ms. Kivalos ex-common law partner, Igor. Ms.\nKivalo recounts that she met Igor soon after her husband died in 2006. She\nmarried Igor in a church wedding within the year following her husbands death.\nShe explains that it is not considered appropriate to engage in a new\nrelationship so quickly and the marriage was never registered with the state.\n\n[7]\nMs. Kivalo claims that Igor became abusive in\n2008 and recounts physical and sexual assaults.\n\n[8]\nIn June 2014, Ms. Kivalo left Ukraine with her\nyoungest son. Her teenage children remained in Ukraine with her sister. The\napplicants arrived in Canada on temporary visas which were later renewed to\nfacilitate their departure from Canada. They then claimed refugee protection in\nMarch 2015, claiming that Igor had threatened Ms. Kivalo and attacked her\nsister in February 2015.\nThe RPD decision\n\n[9]\nThe RPD found that Ms. Kivalo was not a credible\nwitness due to several omissions and inconsistencies in her basis of claim\n[BOC] form, which were not reasonably explained; the lack of any persuasive\nevidence regarding her relationship with Igor; and, the delay in claiming\nprotection until her temporary visa was about to expire.\n\n[10]\nThe RPD concluded that the documents provided by\nMs. Kivalo to corroborate her claim did not overcome the credibility concerns.\nThe RPD noted that:\nThe residence\ncertificate indicates that Igor is a cohabitant, but does not establish\nhis relationship to Ms. Kivalo or that he was abusive.\nThe medical\nbooklets were handwritten and their author could not be verified. Ms.Kivalos\nmedical report for her injuries in Ukraine only contained information that\nshe provided and she was not credible. Her sisters medical report did not\ncontain information about Igor.\nThe police\nresponses provided were not accompanied by police reports and lacked details.\nThe RPD rejected Ms. Kivalos explanation that she thought it was only\nimportant to state that Igor beat her, not to provide the details.\n\n[11]\nThe RPD found that on a balance of probabilities\nthe documents provided were false or fraudulent and attached no weight to them.\n\n[12]\nThe RPD noted the hallmarks of a credibility\nassessment, including omissions, inconsistency and vagueness, and concluded\nthat Ms. Kivalo was generally lacking in credibility, a finding which extended\nto all relevant parts of her testimony.\nII.\nThe Decision Under Review\n\n[13]\nThe RAD stated that it would follow the Federal\nCourts decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [Huruglica FC] and\nconduct an independent assessment of the evidence, affording deference to the\nRPDs findings on issues of credibility or to other findings where the RPD had\nan advantage in reaching its conclusions.\n\n[14]\nThe RAD questioned the credibility of the\nalleged relationship between Ms. Kivalo and Igor as no documentation was\nprovided to establish its existence. The RAD found that, although Igor and Ms.\nKivalo were not legally married, their relationship would be reasonably\nexpected to be noted on the residence certificate.\n\n[15]\nThe RAD also agreed with the RPD that it was not\ncredible that Ms. Kivalo would have omitted her common law partner from her\nCanadian visa applications, including the extension applications. Ms. Kivalo\nhad lived with Igor for several years as his common law spouse and, although\nthe marriage had not been registered, the visa application requires that all\ncommon law relationships be listed.\n\n[16]\nThe RAD found the lack of documentation\nregarding the church marriage and years of cohabitation to be compelling.\n\n[17]\nWith respect to Ms. Kivalos testimony and lack\nof awareness about Igors use of his patrimonial name, which the RPD had found\nto be the basis of a negative credibility inference, the RAD also found this to\nbe an indication that her description of her relationship and abuse by Igor was\nnot credible.\n\n[18]\nThe RAD concluded, on a balance of\nprobabilities, that Ms. Kivalo did not have the relationship she alleged.\n\n[19]\nThe RAD did not agree with the RPDs finding\nthat the medical documents were fraudulent. However, assuming the medical\ndocumentation was genuine, the RAD found that it did not establish or\ncorroborate that Igor was the cause of Ms. Kivalos injuries, noting that it\nwas Ms. Kivalo who told the medical personnel that Igor was the cause. With\nrespect to her sisters injuries, the RAD noted that there was no mention on\nthe document of who caused the injuries. It was only Ms. Kivalo who stated that\nIgor caused the injuries and she was not credible.\n\n[20]\nThe RAD agreed with the RPDs findings regarding\nthe police responses. The RAD noted that the September 2012 request for police\nintervention lacked details and Ms. Kivalos explanation was not credible. The\nRAD also found that the lack of police reports to substantiate the\ninvestigations and measures taken was compelling. Given the credibility\nfindings, the RAD gave no weight to the police documents as proof that Igor was\nthe abuser or that the events occurred as Ms. Kivalo described.\n\n[21]\nThe RAD also agreed with the RPDs finding that Ms.\nKivalos delay in claiming protection did not demonstrate subjective fear of\nher situation in Ukraine. She only made a claim for refugee protection when faced\nwith expulsion from Canada.\nIII.\nThe Issues\n\n[22]\nThe sole issue is whether the decision of the\nRAD is reasonable.\n\n[23]\nThe applicants argue that the RPD erred in its\nassessment of the evidence and in deferring to the findings of the RPD\nregarding the applicants credibility.\nIV.\nThe Standard of Review\n\n[24]\nThe RAD is tasked with conducting an appeal of\nthe RPDs decision. The Court conducts a judicial review of the RADs decision.\n\n[25]\nIn the recent decision Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2016]\nFCJ No 313 (QL) [Huruglica FCA], Justice Gauthier clarified the\nuncertainty regarding the standard of review to be applied by the RAD; the RAD\nshould fulfill its appellate role and apply the standard of correctness when\nreviewing RPD decision.\n\n[26]\nWith respect to deference owed to the RPDs\ncredibility findings, Huruglica FCA does not dictate a single standard\nof review. Justice Gauthier described several scenarios at paras 6973 to\nhighlight the situations where the RAD should consider deference to the RPD\nand, alternatively, where the RAD should be cautious in substituting its\ndecision.\n\n[27]\nJustice Gauthier noted at para 70, that with\nrespect to whether deference is owed to the RPD: In\neach case, the RAD ought to determine whether the RPD truly benefited from an\nadvantageous position, and if so, whether the RAD can nevertheless make a final\ndecision in respect of the refugee claim. Justice Gauthier added at\npara 74: The RAD should be given the opportunity to\ndevelop its own jurisprudence in that respect; there is thus no need for me to\npigeon-hole the RAD to the level of deference owed in each case.\n\n[28]\nIn the present case, the RAD did not have the\nbenefit of the Court of Appeals decision and was guided by the decision of\nthis Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FC. However, the requirement for an independent\nassessment of the evidence confirmed by the Court of Appeal was established in\nthe Federal Courts decision. The RAD indicated that it would conduct an\nindependent assessment and would defer to the RPD on its credibility findings\nwhere the RPD enjoyed an advantage.\n\n[29]\nThe RADs determinations of factual issues,\nincluding credibility, and issues of mixed fact and law are also reviewed on the\nreasonableness standard.\n\n[30]\nThe reasonableness standard focuses on the existence of justification, transparency and\nintelligibility within the decision-making process and considers whether the decision falls within a range of possible,\nacceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). The\nCourt will not re-weigh the evidence or re-make the decision.\nV.\nThe Applicants Submissions\n\n[31]\nThe applicants argue that there was sufficient\ncredible evidence to support their allegations and that the RAD deferred to the\nRPDs microscopic analysis and did not consider that cumulatively, the evidence\nsupports Ms. Kivalos account of abuse by Igor. In particular, the RAD erred in\ndiscounting the corroborative evidence, including the medical booklet, due to\nits credibility findings and erred in finding that Ms. Kivalos delay in\nclaiming refugee protection demonstrated lack of subjective fear.\n\n[32]\nThe applicants submit that the RAD erred by\nfinding Ms. Kivalos testimony to not be credible without considering the\nmedical documentation as relevant corroborating evidence. The applicants point\nto the notations regarding her injuries that were contemporaneous with her\naccount of abuse, including several abortions that Igor forced her to undergo.\n\n[33]\nThe applicants add that the RAD unreasonably\ndismissed the police evidence which corroborates that Ms. Kivalo did make a\ncomplaint to the police of abuse by Igor.\n\n[34]\nThe applicants argue that the corroborating\ndocuments should have been assessed and considered by the RAD before it made\nits credibility findings, rather than simply deferring to the RPD.\nCorroborating documents cannot be discounted because of the credibility\nconcerns about an applicant ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2012] FCJ No 367 (QL)  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[35]\nThe applicants submit that it was unreasonable\nto draw negative credibility findings from the fact that Igor is listed as a\ncohabitant rather than as a common-law spouse on the residence certificate\ngiven that common-law relationships are not accepted in Ukraine. Moreover, the\nresidence certificate was not tendered to establish the relationship, only that\nIgor lived in her house.\n\n[36]\nThe applicants also argue that their delay in\nclaiming refugee protection did not demonstrate lack of subjective fear. They\nwere legally in Canada on visas which were extended up to March 2015 and they\nwere not at risk of returning to Ukraine at that time.\nVI.\nThe Respondents Submissions\n\n[37]\nThe respondent submits that the RAD conducted an\nindependent assessment of the evidence and the subsequent decision of the\nFederal Court of Appeal  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  FCA does not change the\nreasonableness of its analysis.\n\n[38]\nThe respondent notes that the RAD deferred to\nseveral of the RPDs findings, particularly on issues where the RPD had an\nadvantage, including the omissions and inconsistency in Ms.Kivalos\ntestimony before the RPD and the RPDs rejection of her explanations. The RAD\nalso conducted an independent assessment of the documentary evidence and\nreached the same conclusions as the RPD, with the exception of the genuineness\nof the medical booklet.\n\n[39]\nThe respondent notes that the RAD acknowledged\nthat common law relationships are not recognized in Ukraine, yet reasonably\nfound that Igor would be listed as something other than a cohabitant if Ms.\nKivalo and Igor had a church wedding and resided together for over five years.\nThe respondent notes that Ms. Kivalo did not refrain from naming her current common\nlaw partner on her more recent application for a visitors visa.\n\n[40]\nThe respondent disputes the applicants\nsubmission that cumulatively, the evidence supports only the conclusion that\nMs. Kivalos injuries were caused by Igor. Although the RAD did not find that\nthe medical booklet was fraudulent, it was open to the RAD to conclude that the\nmedical documentation did not verify that Igor was the cause of Ms. Kivalos\ninjuries or those of her sister, given that she reported her injuries to\nmedical personnel and her sisters document did not indicate the name of the\nperson who caused the injury.\n\n[41]\nThe respondent submits that the RAD did not err\nby discounting the medical booklet or the police reports tendered as\ncorroborating evidence. The respondent distinguishes Kabongo; in that\ncase the RPD gave no weight to an arrest warrant, which was an independent\ncorroborative document of the information provided by the applicant. A medical\nreport does not necessarily corroborate an applicants allegations where the\nreport depends on the credibility and trustworthiness of the information\nprovided by an applicant to the medical professional.\n\n[42]\nThe respondent adds that the RAD was entitled to\ntake into account the applicants delay in claiming refugee status, along with\nthe other factors it considered. The RAD reasonably concluded that Ms. Kivalo\nhad not demonstrated subjective fear of her situation in Ukraine which impacts\nher credibility.\nVII.\nThe Decision is Reasonable\n\n[43]\nThe RAD conducted an independent assessment of\nthe evidence on the record and deferred to several of the credibility findings\nof the RPD. As noted above, the RPD found Ms.Kivalos testimony\ninconsistent, some of her accounts to be implausible, several omissions in her\nBOC and her explanations to be unreasonable. The RAD reasonably found that the\nRPD had not erred in its credibility findings or other findings, with the\nexception of its finding that the medical documentation could be fraudulent.\n\n[44]\nI do not agree that the RAD simply deferred to\nthe RPDs analysis; the RAD conducted an independent assessment of all the\nevidence and deferred to the RPD where appropriate, based on the RPDs\nadvantage in hearing the applicants testimony, responses to questions and\nexplanations.\n\n[45]\nMs. Kivalo argued that the medical records of\nher injuries, combined with the evidence of the police response, which could\nonly be a response to her reports of violence by Igor, along with her other\nevidence leads only to the conclusion that she suffered the domestic abuse she\nrecounted. However, the RAD reasonably found that there was no sufficient or\ncredible evidence of Ms. Kivalos marriage or common law relationship with\nIgor.\n\n[46]\nAlthough it may not have been possible for Ms.\nKivalo to list Igor as a common law partner on her residence certificate, the\nresidence certificate could still not assist in establishing any relationship\nwith Igor. As noted by the RPD and RAD, the certificate was issued to and\nlisted Ms. Kivalos teenage daughter as the applicant for the certificate. The\nRAD did not err in questioning the residence certificate.\n\n[47]\nWith respect to the applicants argument that\nthe RAD erred in discounting the medical evidence due to its credibility\nconcerns, rather than considering the corroborative evidence first and then\ndetermining the credibility of the applicant, I agree with the respondent that Kabongo\ncan be distinguished.\n\n[48]\nIn Kabongo, Justice Rennie found that the\nRPD erred by failing to consider that the applicants testimony was\ncorroborated by a warrant for his arrest. Justice Rennie found: [t]he warrant was itself highly relevant to the credibility\nof his testimony. The Board cannot find the applicants testimony not credible\nwithout consideration of relevant corroborative evidence, and then subsequently\nreject the supporting evidence because of the credibility finding.\n\n[49]\nIn the present case, the RAD found that Ms.\nKivalo was not credible, and then found that her medical booklet which reported\nher injuries and Igor as the abuser to be not credible. The RAD did not fail to\nconsider the medical booklet. However, the medical booklets reference to Igor\nas the cause of her injuries (or some of her injuries) is not independent\nevidence, as is an arrest warrant. Ms. Kivalos statement to medical personnel\nthat Igor caused her injuries, therefore, cannot corroborate her other\naccounts, which the RAD considered and found not credible, that Igor caused her\ninjuries. The RAD made many credibility findings against Ms. Kivalo and her\ncredibility cannot be rehabilitated by relying on her own discredited account.\n\n[50]\nAs noted by the respondent, the jurisprudence\nhas cautioned that the recounting of events to medical personnel does not make\nthese events more credible and that the resulting medical report cannot confirm\nallegations of abuse For example, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), 53 ACWS (3d) 371 (FCTD), and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL),\n44 ACWS (3d) 766 (FCTD), the Court noted that opinion evidence is only as valid\nas the truth of the facts upon which it is based.\n\n[51]\nSimilarly, the RAD reasonably gave little weight\nto the police responses to Ms. Kivalos complaints. The documents, which were\nnot police reports, were insufficient to establish that Igor was the abuser or\nthat the events occurred as alleged.\n\n[52]\nThe RAD did not err in finding that Ms. Kivalos\ndelay in claiming refugee protection demonstrated lack of subjective fear.\n\n[53]\nJustice Zinn provided a helpful summary of the\nlaw regarding delay in claiming protection in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 1368 (QL), noting\nat para 21 that delay may be a valid factor to consider, but delay does not\nautomatically result in a finding of lack of subjective fear. The circumstances\nand explanations for the delay must be considered. At paras 22-23, Justice Zinn\nnoted the jurisprudence that established the principle that having temporary\nstatus in Canada and not being subject to immediate removal was not a sufficient\nexplanation for a delay in failing to make a refugee claim, but he found that\nthe circumstances of the temporary status must be considered to determine\nwhether this shows a lack of subjective fear.\n\n[54]\nIn the present case, the RAD considered Ms.\nKivalos explanation for her delay in claiming protection and found that it was\nnot reasonable. Ms. Kivalo had come to Canada on a temporary visa which was\nextended at least twice, the last time to permit her to return to Ukraine on a\nparticular date as planned. Ms. Kivalo did not mention Igor in any of her visa\napplications or extension applications. She did not make a refugee claim naming\nIgor as her common law partner or abuser until faced with the requirement to\nleave Canada.\n\n[55]\nWith respect to the applicants submission that,\ncumulatively, there was sufficient evidence to support Ms. Kivalos account of\nabuse by Igor, I do not agree that the RAD failed to properly assess Ms.\nKivalos credibility in the context of all the evidence. The RAD made many\ncredibility findings, including related to Ms. Kivalos failure to name Igor on\nthe visa applications, her lack of awareness of Igors patrimonial name, the\nabsence of any documentation of a relationship with Igor and her delay in\nclaiming refugee protection. None of these findings related to evidence which\ncould corroborate that she was in a relationship with Igor or that Igor was the\ncause of her injuries.\n\n[56]\nWhile the applicants argue that there was no\nother reasonable conclusion, the RAD reasonably found otherwise. The RAD also\ndeferred to the RPD, based on its assessment of Ms. Kivalos testimony and the\ndocumentary evidence, which went so far as to find that she was generally\nlacking in credibility, which extended to all aspects of her claim.\n\n[57]\nThe jurisprudence in the context of judicial\nreviews of RPD decisions and those of other tribunals that have heard the\ntestimony and assessed the credibility of an applicant guides the Court to show\nsignificant deference to such findings ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> NR 315\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2008] FCJ No 1329 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2012] FCJ No 924\n(QL)). I see no reason to take a different approach to credibility findings\nconfirmed by the RAD following its independent assessment of the evidence on\nthe record or where the RAD defers to the RPD based on its assessment.\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURTS JUDGMENT is that the\napplication for judicial review is dismissed.\nThere\nis no question for certification.\n\"Catherine M.

      "The court determined that the RAD’s assessment of the lack of documentation regarding the relationship (marriage or common-law) was reasonable, noting the applicant’s failure to disclose the relationship on visa applications and the implausibility of omitting a common-law partner.",
      "The court upheld the RAD’s finding that the applicant’s delay in claiming refugee protection, until facing expulsion from Canada, did not demonstrate a subjective fear of persecution, as she had temporary status and was not at immediate risk of removal.",
      "The court applied the reasonableness standard, emphasizing that it would not re-weigh the evidence or substitute its own decision for that of the RAD, but rather assess whether the RAD’s decision fell within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes.",
