    "[0]\nINTRODUCTION",
    "[1]\nShore, J.\n: \"The intractable difficulty is this. It is hard to conceive that a legislature would create a tribunal with a limited jurisdiction and yet bestow on such tribunal an unlimited power to determine the extent of its jurisdiction. ... The power to review jurisdictional questions provides the Courts with a useful tool to ensure that tribunals deal with the type of issues which the Legislature intended.\" (Mr. Justice Dickson, as he then was, dissenting, in\nJacmain, Re\n, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 15; 18 N.R. 361\n).\n\"... although the tribunal had jurisdiction to enter on the inquiry ... It may in perfect good faith have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it failed to deal with the question remitted to it ...\" (Lord Reid in the decision of the House of Lords, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1969] 2 W.L.R. 163; [1969] 2 All E.R. 208 (H.L.)\n).\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURE",
    "[2]\nThis is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[see footnote 1] (\nIRPA\n) of the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) which, on March 31, 2004, dismissed the Applicant's appeal from the refusal of his sponsorship application of his daughter.\nBACKGROUND",
    "[3]\nBorn in Haiti, the Applicant, Mr. Jean-Edouard Jean-Jacques, came to Canada as a landed immigrant on February 22, 1998. In 2000, Mr. Jean-Jacques found out that he had a daughter, Wedgine Jean-Jacques, born on October 1, 1989 from a woman with whom he had a short relationship and who did not advise him she was pregnant and gave birth to a child. Mr. Jean-Jacques took steps to acknowledge the child by way of an \"Acte de reconnaissance\" in July 2000. A DNA test confirmed that Mr. Jean-Jacques is the father.",
    "[4]\nIn 2002, Mr. Jean-Jacques applied to sponsor his daughter, who was living with a friend, her mother and grandparents having passed away. In a letter dated December 2, 2003, a visa officer refused the sponsorship because he concluded the daughter was not a member of the family class and was therefore inadmissible according to paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n[see footnote 2] (\nRegulations\n). This paragraph states that a foreign national is not considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined. The visa officer concluded that since Mr. Jean-Jacques did not include his daughter in his application for permanent residence in 1997, she was not examined by the immigration authorities when Mr. Jean-Jacques made his application and therefore she could not be considered a member of the family class.",
    "[5]\nMr. Jean-Jacques appealed the visa officer's decision because at no time, when he filled his application for permanent residence and was accepted, did he have knowledge of the existence of his daughter. On March 31, 2004, the IAD rejected the appeal.\nDECISION UNDER REVIEW",
    "[6]\nThe IAD rejected the appeal on the basis that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The lack of jurisdiction results from the fact that the visa officer rightly concluded, in light of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n, that the daughter was not a member of the family class.\nISSUES",
    "[7]\n1. Did the IAD err by declaring itself not competent to hear an appeal with regard to paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n?\n2. Is paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\nultra vires because it does not take into account the sponsor's knowledge of the existence of non-accompanying family members?\n3. Does paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\nviolate paragraph 2(d) of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n?\nIssues numbers 2 and 3 were withdrawn by counsel for the applicant at the outset.\nANALYSIS\n1. Did the IAD err by declaring itself not competent to hear an appeal with regard to paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n?",
    "[8]\nMr. Jean-Jacques argues that the IAD should have taken jurisdiction to hear the appeal and to determine Mr. Jean-Jacques's credibility. He argues it is so because the rules of natural justice dictate that no person be penalized for his or her actions if he or she acted without knowledge and that, therefore, subjective knowledge of existing non-accompanying dependants needs to be read into paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n.",
    "[9]\nThe Court agrees that the IAD should have taken jurisdiction over this appeal but for different reasons than those argued by Mr. Jean-Jacques. In the present case, credibility was not an issue since, contrary to Mr. Jean-Jacques' allegation, deliberate non-disclosure is not a requirement for a finding under paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n.",
    "[10]\nUnder the former\nImmigration Act\n, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, the IAD had jurisdiction to hear cases dealing with the refusal to approve an application for landing\nmade by a member of the family class\n. The IAD had jurisdiction to hear cases dealing with the refusal to approve an application for landing,\nmade by a member of the family class\n, whereas, that is not the case under the new\nAct\n,\nIRPA\n.",
    "[11]\nSubsection 63(1) of\nIRPA\n, which indicates who has a right of appeal before the IAD, no longer requires the foreign national to be a member of the family class in order for the sponsor to appeal. As long as a family sponsorship application was\nfiled\n(no matter whether the foreign national was declared a member of the family class or not a member of the family class by the visa officer), the potential sponsor has the right to appeal the decision of non issuance to the foreign national of a permanent resident visa:\n\"63(1) A person who has filed in the prescribed manner an application to sponsor a foreign national as a member of the family class may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a decision not to issue the foreign national a permanent resident visa.\"\n\"63(1) Quiconque a déposé, conformément au règlement, une demande de parrainage au titre du regroupement familial peut interjeter appel du refus de délivrer le visa de résident permanent.\"",
    "[12]\nConsequently, the IAD is simply to hear the case to decide whether to uphold or overturn the visa officer's finding that Mr. Jean-Jacques' daughter was not a member of the family class; and that decision is clearly for the IAD to decide.",
    "[13]\nUnder the circumstances, it is for the IAD to reexamine the matter and to render a decision that it considers appropriate.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[14]\nFor these reasons, the Court answers the first question at issue in the affirmative and therefore it could not have responded to the second and third questions as the application for judicial review is granted at the outset (nevertheless, as stated by the counsel for the applicant, Issues 2 and 3, were withdraw at the beginning of the Court session).\nORDER",
    "[15]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that this application for judicial review be granted and that the matter be remitted to the IAD for its examination. No question is certified.\nObiter",
    "[16] IRPA\nallows for\nRegulations\nto define membership in the family class for the purposes of sponsorship. Paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\nappears to seek to discourage\nmisrepresentations\nby applicants. The Court, in light of Mr. Justice Kelen's decision, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  reflects accordingly. In the present case, misrepresentations are not at stake as agreed to by both parties, Mr. Jean-Jacques had no knowledge of his daughter's existence when he filled his permanent residence application. Whatever the operation of paragraph 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n, subsection 25(1) of\nIRPA\nis available and provides:\n\"25(1) The Minister shall, upon request of a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, and may, on the Minister's own initiative, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to them, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected, or by public policy considerations.\"\n\"25(1) Le ministre doit, sur demande d'un étranger interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas à la présente loi, et peut, de sa propre initiative, étudier le cas de cet étranger et peut lui octroyer le statut de résident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des critères et obligations applicables, s'il estime que des circonstances d'ordre humanitaire relatives à l'étranger -- compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché -- ou l'intérêt public le justifient.\"",
    "[17]\nYet, there is an important distinction, as to how the IAD will decide, that is for it to do; however, according to subsection 63(1), the \"person\" referred to in that subsection , in the circumstances described, \"may appeal\". In closing, it is important to recognize that\nIRPA\nis still in its infancy and awaits the understanding that only time and usage will bring.\nApplication allowed.\nEditor: Elizabeth M.A. Turgeon/djc\nFootnotes\n1.

      "In 2000, the individual learned of the existence of a daughter born in 1989 to a woman with whom he had a brief relationship.",
      "The individual formally acknowledged paternity of the daughter in 2000 via an 'Acte de reconnaissance'.",
      "A DNA test confirmed the biological relationship.",
      "In 2002, the individual applied to sponsor his daughter for immigration.",
      "In 2003, a visa officer refused the sponsorship application, citing the daughter's ineligibility under a specific regulation regarding family class membership.",
      "The regulation in question concerned individuals not included in a prior permanent residence application by the sponsor.",
      "The individual appealed the visa officer's decision, asserting he was unaware of his daughter's existence at the time of his initial immigration application.",
      "The Immigration and Refugee Board (IAD) dismissed the appeal, claiming lack of jurisdiction."
    ],
    "key_arguments": {
      "Applicants": [
        "The IAD should have taken jurisdiction to hear the appeal.",
        "Rules of natural justice dictate that a person should not be penalized for actions taken without knowledge.",
        "Subjective knowledge of existing non-accompanying dependants should be read into paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations.",
        "The applicant had no knowledge of his daughter’s existence when he applied for permanent residence."
      ],
      "Respondents": [
        "The IAD lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the visa officer correctly concluded the daughter was not a member of the family class under paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations.",
        "Deliberate non-disclosure is not a requirement for a finding under paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations."
      ]
    },
    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue was whether the IAD erred in declining jurisdiction over the appeal. The court found that the IAD *should* have exercised jurisdiction, but not for the reasons argued by the applicant (regarding subjective knowledge).",
      "The court’s reasoning hinged on a statutory interpretation of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA), specifically subsection 63(1). The court determined that IRPA grants a right of appeal to the IAD for anyone who files a family sponsorship application, regardless of whether the visa officer initially deems the sponsored individual a member of the family class.",
      "The court contrasted the current IRPA framework with the previous *Immigration Act*, noting that under the former Act, the IAD’s jurisdiction was tied to family class membership, but this is no longer the case. IRPA broadened the scope of appealable decisions.",
      "The court clarified that credibility regarding deliberate non-disclosure was not a relevant factor in this case, as paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations does not require proof of intentional misrepresentation. The focus was solely on whether the IAD had the authority to hear the appeal.",
      "The court acknowledged that paragraph 117(9)(d) of the Regulations may be intended to deter misrepresentation, but this was not central to its decision. It also noted the availability of subsection 25(1) of IRPA, which allows for consideration of humanitarian and compassionate grounds, but deferred to the IAD to determine how that provision might apply.",
      "Ultimately, the court granted judicial review and remitted the matter to the IAD because it concluded that, based on the plain language of IRPA, the IAD had the jurisdiction to review the visa officer’s determination of family class membership."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application for judicial review was granted.",
      "The matter was remitted to the Immigration Appeal Division for its examination.",
      "No question was certified."
