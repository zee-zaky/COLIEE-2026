    "[1]\nSnider, J.\n: Ms. Collier has been hoping, since 1999, to bring her youngest son, John, to Canada from the Philippines. In 1986, Ms. Collier was granted permanent resident status in Canada and became a citizen in 1991. At that time, contrary to the legal requirement to list all her dependent children, Ms. Collier made no mention of her five children.",
    "[2]\nIn 1999, she commenced the process to sponsor her youngest son, John as a member of the \"family class\".",
    "[3]\nOn June 28, 2002, the new\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(\"\nIRPA\n\") and\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n(\"\nRegulations\n\") came into force. The\nRegulations\ncontain a provision that was not included in former\nImmigration Act\nor\nRegulations\n. Section 117(9)(d) provides that a person will not be considered to be a member of the family class if that person was not examined at the time of the sponsor's application for permanent residence.",
    "[4]\nOn February 21, 2003, John's sponsored application for landing was refused on the basis that, due to Ms. Collier's failure to disclose his existence, John was not examined in connection with the application for landing .",
    "[5]\nMs. Collier appealed this decision. Each of the Respondent and Ms. Collier made very brief written submission. In its Notice of Decision and Reasons dated September 26, 2003, a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Immigration Appeal Division (\"IAD\") dismissed the appeal, stating that:\n\"On the basis of the information provided, the person who was sponsored by the appellant is not a member of the family class. Therefore, under s. 65 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, the IAD has no discretionary jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\"",
    "[6]\nMs. Collier seeks judicial review of this decision. In spite of very capable representations by Ms. Collier's counsel, I am unable to allow her application for the reasons that follow.\nIssues",
    "[7]\nThe Applicant raises the following issues:\n1. What is the applicable standard of review?\n2. Did the IAD err by failing to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the Applicant's sponsorship application?\n3. Did the IAD err by failing to consider the published policy of the Respondent, which clarifies the otherwise restrictive application of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n?\n4. Did the IAD err by failing to consider the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and the proposed amendments applicable to the\nRegulations\n?\n5. Did the IAD err by failing to consider relevant factors or evidence before it?\n6. Did the IAD err by failing to consider the objectives of the\nIRPA\nin its interpretation of the applicable provisions?\nAnalysis\nIssue #1: What is the applicable standard of review?",
    "[8]\nMs. Collier submits that a standard of correctness should be applied to a question such as this that involves jurisdiction. The issue of the interpretation of s. 355 is a question of statutory interpretation to which a standard of correctness should apply. However, ascertaining the IAD's jurisdiction to hear appeals from members of the family class required the IAD to consider the facts of this case and determine whether they are captured by s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n. Accordingly, this is an issue of mixed fact and law for which the standard of review is reasonableness simpliciter (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 191 F.T.R. 311 (T.D.), at para. 21).\nIssue #2: Did the IAD err by failing to apply s. 355 of the Regulations to the Applicant's sponsorship application?",
    "[9]\nMs. Collier submits that the IAD failed to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the application.",
    "[10]\nSection 355 of the\nRegulations\nis a transitional provision that only applies to applications made before June 28, 2002 when the\nIRPA\ncame into force. There is some difference of opinion as to when the sponsorship application was perfected. For purposes of this judicial review, I have assumed, without deciding, that the application was made in June, 2002, prior to the coming into force of the\nIRPA\n, and that I should, therefore, have regard to the transitional provisions. However, as discussed below, s. 355 does not assist Ms. Collier.",
    "[11]\nThe IAD has jurisdiction to hear the appeal of a \"person who has filed in the prescribed manner an application to sponsor a foreign national as a member of the family class\" (s. 63(1),\nIRPA\n). The IAD held that the operation of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRules\ndeprived it of any jurisdiction to hear Ms. Collier's appeal.\n\"No foreign national may be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if\n. . . . .\n(d) the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member ... of the sponsor and was not examined.\"\n\"The following persons are not considered to belong to the family reunification category due to their relationship with the sponsor:\n. . . . .\n(d) in the case where the sponsor became a permanent resident following an application to that effect, the foreign national who, at the time the application was made, was not the subject of a check and was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor or was a former spouse or former common-law partner of the sponsor.\"",
    "[12]\nMs. Collier admits that she did not disclose the existence of her five children on her application for permanent residence and, consequently, they were not examined by Canadian immigration officials. Thus, John falls squarely within s. 117(9)(d) and would not be a member of the \"family class\".",
    "[13]\nIn Ms. Collier's submission, however, s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nshields John from being caught by subsection 117(9)(d). She submits that s. 355 of the\nRegulations\npermits all those who applied for permanent residence under the former\nImmigration Act\nto sponsor dependents, irrespective of their existence being disclosed to Canadian immigration authorities. I disagree.",
    "[14]\nSection 355 of the\nRules\nmust be read in connection with s. 352 of the\nRules\n:\n\"A person is not required to include in an application ... a non-accompanying child who is not a dependent son ... within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the former Regulations and is a dependent child as defined in s. 2 of these Regulations if the application was made under the former Act before the day on which this section comes into force.\"\n\"A person who, before the coming into force of this section, made an application under the old Act is not required to mention in his or her application, if he or she does not accompany him or her, his or her common-law partner or any child -- who is a dependent child within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of these regulations -- who is not a 'dependent daughter' or a 'dependent son' within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the old regulations.\"",
    "[15]\nThe general age limit of a dependent child changed from someone who is 18 under s. 2(1) of the former\nRules\nto 21 under s. 2 of the new\nRules\n.\nSection 355 of the\nRules\nstates:\n\"If a person who made an application under the former Act before the day on which this section comes into force sponsors a non-accompanying dependent child, referred to section 352, who makes an application as a member of the family class ... paragraph 117(9)(d) does not apply in respect of that dependent child ...\" (emphasis mine)\n\"Paragraph 117(9)(d) of these Regulations does not apply to dependent children referred to in section 352 of these Regulations or to the common-law spouse of a person who is not accompanying the person and who is making an application under the family class or the spouse or common-law partner class in Canada if that person is sponsoring them and made an application under the old Act before the date on which this section comes into force.\"",
    "[16]\nMs. Collier rightly asserts that provisions of the\nIRPA\nare to be read in their context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the statute, its object, and Parliament's intention (R. Sullivan,\nSullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes\n, 4th Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 2002), at 2 (\"Driedger\"). It is precisely this imperative that leads me to read s. 355 in harmony with s. 352. Upon doing this, I conclude that s. 355 does not save John from the application of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n.",
    "[17]\nSection 355 is intended save an application from s. 117(9)(d) if it was filed under the former regulatory scheme and in accordance with the former definition of dependent child within that scheme. By this, I mean that a child who is between 19 and 21, although a dependent under the new\nRegulations\n, did not need to be included as a non-accompanying dependent child in the sponsor's application for landing under the former regulations. Put simply, the new age limit for dependent children under the new\nRegulations\ndoes not render defective an application filed in accordance with the old regulatory scheme and before the\nRegulations\ncame into force. This protection is inapplicable to Ms. Collier's situation; John was not between the ages of 19 and 21 in 1986 when Ms. Collier became a permanent resident. The IAD did not err by failing to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the facts of this case.",
    "[18]\nA recent decision of this Court supports this reasoning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 254 F.T.R. 122 (F.C.), Justice Martineau of this Court held that, where a sponsor fails to declare his or her dependants before landing in Canada, s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\nprecludes inclusion of those dependents in the \"family class\" for the purpose of an application for permanent residence. Justice Martineau confirmed in this decision that it would be contrary to the express language of the\nRegulations\nto require the IAD to consider s. 355.",
    "[19]\nThe IAD correctly interpreted s. 117(9)(d) of the\nIRPA\nand s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nand correctly applied the facts of this case to those provisions.\nIssue #3: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the published policy of the Respondent,which clarifies the otherwise restrictive application of s. 117(9)(d) of the Regulations?",
    "[20]\nOn June 23, 2003, the Respondent published an Operations Memoranda, Overseas Processing, (the \"OP Manual\") that sought to clarify the application of s. 117(9)(d). The OP Manual states:\n\"The applicant should have been fully counselled by the visa officer on the consequences of not having the child examined, i.e., exclusion from later sponsorship in the family class by the applicant. The CAIPS notes must reflect this counselling took place.\n. . . . .\n\"In cases where, upon review, it is not clear that the applicant in fact made the choice not to have the child examined and it is not clear that the applicant understood the consequences of the choice, a review board may conclude that the visa officer was in breach and that the applicant was not correctly advised. Natural justice and fairness require that the consequences of a decision of this magnitude be fully explained and understood, whether at an interview or through correspondence.\n. . . . .\n\"It's our intention to amend R117(9)(d) to ensure that only persons who the applicant made a conscious decision to exclude are not members of the family class by virtue of their relationship to the sponsor. Where CIC chose not to examine the family member because of an administrative decision or due to an administrative error or for policy reasons, the family member would not be excluded from membership in the family class.\"",
    "[21]\nMs. Collier submits that, in its interpretation of the scope and application of s. 117(9)(d), the IAD had an obligation at law to consider the OP Manual. This submission, even if accepted, does not advance Ms. Collier's case. Upon carefully reading the OP Manual to which Ms. Collier directs this Court's attention, I believe that it offers guidance to Canadian immigration officials on how to advise those who disclose the existence of their non-accompanying dependents at the time they apply for permanent residence in Canada and who elect not to have the child examined. For further clarity, the final paragraph cited above states explicitly that s. 117(9)(d) is intended to exclude family members who were consciously excluded from an applicant's application. That covers the case of Ms. Collier who, in 1985, consciously chose not to disclose the existence of her children. She cannot now rely on the OP Manual to assist her.",
    "[22]\nIn 1991, Ms. Collier successfully sponsored three of her children to come to Canada, at which time she disclosed to immigration officials the existence of her other two children, including John born in 1985. Ms. Collier submits that, owing to her disclosure in 1991 when she sponsored three of her children, the OP Manual obliged Canadian immigration officials to advise her of the consequences of not having her non-accompanying dependent children examined. On my reading of the OP Manual, the obligation of Canadian immigration officials, if it exists, only arises when disclosure of non-accompanying dependents is made in the sponsor's own application for permanent residence in Canada. For Ms. Collier, that was in 1985 and not when she sponsored her other three children in 1991.",
    "[23]\nIn any event, a policy of the Respondent cannot be in conflict with the words of a statutory provision. Thus, even if the policy read as proposed by Ms. Collier, it would likely be ultra vires and of no force.\nIssue #4: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and the proposed amendments applicable to the Regulations, which were published in Part 1 of the Canada Gazette?",
    "[24]\nThe Applicant submits that IAD failed to take into account the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement published in Part I of the Canada Gazette on September 27, 2003 (\"RIAS\") which was published with the\nRegulations\nand which supports the interpretation of the\nRegulations\nproposed by Ms. Collier.",
    "[25]\nThe RIAS contained, inter alia, the following objective and means to its realization:\n\"...Ensure that some family members who were not examined\nas part of their sponsor's application for immigration to Canada\nare not excluded from the family class;\n. . . . .\n\"The amendments to s. 117 of the\nRules\nensure that certain family members who were not examined as part of a sponsor's application for immigration to Canada are no longer excluded from the family class and could be sponsored. These family members were originally\nnot examined for administrative or policy reasons.\nThis change affects family members of ... persons who applied priority to the coming into force of\nIRPA\n.\" (Emphasis added)\n\"...Ensure that certain family members who have not been subject to control\nas part of the application for immigration to Canada\npresented by their sponsor are not excluded from the family reunification category;\n. . . . .\n\"The modifications made to article 117 of the\nRegulations\nguarantee that certain family members who were not screened as part of the sponsor's immigration application are no longer excluded from the family reunification category and could be sponsored. These people were not initially screened because\nthat they were not subject to this obligation for administrative or political reasons.\nThis change affects family members of refugees, people who have submitted an application to Canada for humanitarian reasons as well as those who submitted an application before the entry into force of the\nIRPA\n.\"",
    "[26]\nSimilar to my comments about the OP Manual, when the relevant portions of the RIAS are read carefully, it appearsthat the proposed amendments apply to cases where a family member is not examined as part of his or her sponsor's application for immigration to Canada because of administrative or policy reasons. In this case, John was not examined as part of Ms. Collier's application for immigration to Canada because of her failure to disclose his existence to the immigration officials who processed her application for landing. The failure to examine John at the time that Ms. Collier came to Canada in 1986 cannot be attributed to administrative or policy reasons. Consequently, even if the RIAS ought to have been considered by the IAD, which is neither admitted nor denied, it, like the OP manual, is not relevant to the case at bar. Neither of these documents assists Ms. Collier.\nIssue #5: Did the IAD err by failing to consider relevant factors or evidence before it?",
    "[27]\nMs. Collier submits that the IAD failed to consider a number of relevant factors. Briefly, the facts upon which Ms. Collier wishes to rely are as follows:\n- Once Ms. Collier became a Canadian citizen in 1991, she sponsored her three middle children, Jeriel, Jamie and Jiselle, to come to Canada. In the affidavit Ms. Collier swore for this judicial review, she deposed that, at the time she sponsored her three middle children, she informed Canadian immigration officials that she has five children (disclosure).\n- The applications for Ms. Collier's three children's applications were approved by the Respondent; they arrived in Canada in 1992 (acceptance).\n- The application for John was submitted in June 1999. Therefore, owing to the Respondent's inaction, the sponsorship application was delayed by three years prior to its refusal (delay).",
    "[28]\nMs. Collier submits that these arguments of disclosure, acceptance and delay are relevant to the decision making process. I disagree for the simple reason that evidence of these matters was not before the IAD. In her submission to the IAD, there is a vague reference to her other children. However, this reference is not supported by any documentary evidence.",
    "[29]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 72 F.T.R. 49 (T.D.), at para. 4, Justice Gibson held:\n\"It is trite law that judicial review of a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal should proceed on the basis of the evidence that was before the decision-maker.\"",
    "[30]\nFor this reason, it is not appropriate to consider this evidence in this judicial review. Further, it is unreasonable to expect that the IAD has a duty to follow up on the comments in the letter. Ms. Collier bore the burden of putting evidence she thought was relevant before the IAD.",
    "[31]\nHowever, even if I were to consider this evidence, I fail to see how it would have allowed the visa officer, in the first instance, or the IAD to circumvent the clear language of the\nRegulations\n.\nIssue #6: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the objectives of the IRPA in its interpretation of the applicable provisions?",
    "[32]\nOne of the objects stated in the\nIRPA\nis \"to see that families are reunited in Canada\" (s. 3(1)(d)). Ms. Collier submits that IAD failed to consider the object of family reunification in s. 3(1)(d) in its interpretation of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n.",
    "[33]\nSection 3 of the\nIRPA\ncannot be read in a vacuum. While I completely agree with Ms. Collier that statutory provisions should be read harmoniously with the object of a statute, this cannot occur at the expense of ignoring Parliament's intention, which is discernible in the wording of s. 117(9)(d) (Driedger, supra). The intentions of Parliament are to be discerned from the plain meaning of the words in the statute. In this case, those words clearly state that the dependents of a prospective immigrant are to be disclosed before or at the time of admission to Canada. The privileges that attach to the family member class are to be conferred only on those dependents about whom Canadian immigration authorities are made aware (\nNatt\n, supra at para. 14).\nConclusion",
    "[34]\nIn summary, both the visa officer and the IAD came to a correct determination of the law. Section 355 of the\nRegulations\nis intended to apply only to persons who were between 18 and 21 at the time of landing of their sponsors and does not apply to the facts of this case. Because of the operation of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n, the IAD had no jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Collier or the humanitarian and compassionate factors that may arise in this case. For these reasons, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.",
    "[35]\nNeither party proposed question for certification. None will be certified.\nORDER",
    "[36]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question of general importance is certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/gs\n[End of document]"

The IAD did not err by failing to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the facts of this case.\n[18]\nA recent decision of this Court supports this reasoning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 254 F.T.R. 122 (F.C.), Justice Martineau of this Court held that, where a sponsor fails to declare his or her dependants before landing in Canada, s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\nprecludes inclusion of those dependents in the \"family class\" for the purpose of an application for permanent residence. Justice Martineau confirmed in this decision that it would be contrary to the express language of the\nRegulations\nto require the IAD to consider s. 355.\n[19]\nThe IAD correctly interpreted s. 117(9)(d) of the\nIRPA\nand s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nand correctly applied the facts of this case to those provisions.\nIssue #3: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the published policy of the Respondent,which clarifies the otherwise restrictive application of s. 117(9)(d) of the Regulations?\n[20]\nOn June 23, 2003, the Respondent published an Operations Memoranda, Overseas Processing, (the \"OP Manual\") that sought to clarify the application of s. 117(9)(d). The OP Manual states:\n\"The applicant should have been fully counselled by the visa officer on the consequences of not having the child examined, i.e., exclusion from later sponsorship in the family class by the applicant. The CAIPS notes must reflect this counselling took place.\n. . . . .\n\"In cases where, upon review, it is not clear that the applicant in fact made the choice not to have the child examined and it is not clear that the applicant understood the consequences of the choice, a review board may conclude that the visa officer was in breach and that the applicant was not correctly advised. Natural justice and fairness require that the consequences of a decision of this magnitude be fully explained and understood, whether at an interview or through correspondence.\n. . . . .\n\"It's our intention to amend R117(9)(d) to ensure that only persons who the applicant made a conscious decision to exclude are not members of the family class by virtue of their relationship to the sponsor. Where CIC chose not to examine the family member because of an administrative decision or due to an administrative error or for policy reasons, the family member would not be excluded from membership in the family class.\"\n[21]\nMs. Collier submits that, in its interpretation of the scope and application of s. 117(9)(d), the IAD had an obligation at law to consider the OP Manual. This submission, even if accepted, does not advance Ms. Collier's case. Upon carefully reading the OP Manual to which Ms. Collier directs this Court's attention, I believe that it offers guidance to Canadian immigration officials on how to advise those who disclose the existence of their non-accompanying dependents at the time they apply for permanent residence in Canada and who elect not to have the child examined. For further clarity, the final paragraph cited above states explicitly that s. 117(9)(d) is intended to exclude family members who were consciously excluded from an applicant's application. That covers the case of Ms. Collier who, in 1985, consciously chose not to disclose the existence of her children. She cannot now rely on the OP Manual to assist her.\n[22]\nIn 1991, Ms. Collier successfully sponsored three of her children to come to Canada, at which time she disclosed to immigration officials the existence of her other two children, including John born in 1985. Ms. Collier submits that, owing to her disclosure in 1991 when she sponsored three of her children, the OP Manual obliged Canadian immigration officials to advise her of the consequences of not having her non-accompanying dependent children examined. On my reading of the OP Manual, the obligation of Canadian immigration officials, if it exists, only arises when disclosure of non-accompanying dependents is made in the sponsor's own application for permanent residence in Canada. For Ms. Collier, that was in 1985 and not when she sponsored her other three children in 1991.\n[23]\nIn any event, a policy of the Respondent cannot be in conflict with the words of a statutory provision. Thus, even if the policy read as proposed by Ms. Collier, it would likely be ultra vires and of no force.\nIssue #4: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and the proposed amendments applicable to the Regulations, which were published in Part 1 of the Canada Gazette?\n[24]\nThe Applicant submits that IAD failed to take into account the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement published in Part I of the Canada Gazette on September 27, 2003 (\"RIAS\") which was published with the\nRegulations\nand which supports the interpretation of the\nRegulations\nproposed by Ms. Collier.\n[25]\nThe RIAS contained, inter alia, the following objective and means to its realisation:\n\"... Ensure that some family members who were not examined\nas part of their sponsor's application for immigration to Canada\nare not excluded from the family class;\n. . . . .\n\"The amendments to s. 117 of the\nRegulations\nensure that certain family members who were not examined as part of a sponsor's application for immigration to Canada are no longer excluded from the family class and could be sponsored. These family members were originally\nnot examined for administrative or policy reasons.\nThis change affects family members of ... persons who applied prior to the coming into force of\nIRPA\n.\" (Emphasis added)\n\"... Font en sorte que certains membres de la famille qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle\ndans le cadre de la demande d'immigration au Canada\nprésentée par leur répondant ne soient pas exclus de la catégorie du regroupement familial;\n. . . . .\n\"Les modifications apportées à l'article 117 du\nRèglement\ngarantissent que certains membres de la famille qui n'ont pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle dans le cadre de la demande d'immigration présentée par le répondant ne sont plus exclus de la catégorie du regroupement familial et pourraient être parrainés. Ces personnes n'ont pas initialement fait l'objet d'un contrôle parce\nqu'elles n'étaient pas assujetties à cette obligation pour des raisons d'ordre administratif ou politique.\nCette modification touche les membres de la famille des réfugiés, les personnes ayant présenté une demande au Canada pour des motifs d'ordre humanitaire ainsi que celles ayant présenté un demande avant l'entrée en vigueur de la\nLIPR\n.\"\n[26]\nSimilar to my comments about the OP Manual, when the relevant portions of the RIAS are read carefully, it appearsthat the proposed amendments apply to cases where a family member is not examined as part of his or her sponsor's application for immigration to Canada because of administrative or policy reasons. In this case, John was not examined as part of Ms. Collier's application for immigration to Canada because of her failure to disclose his existence to the immigration officials who processed her application for landing. The failure to examine John at the time that Ms. Collier came to Canada in 1986 cannot be attributed to administrative or policy reasons. Consequently, even if the RIAS ought to have been considered by the IAD, which is neither admitted nor denied, it, like the OP manual, is not relevant to the case at bar. Neither of these documents assists Ms. Collier.\nIssue #5: Did the IAD err by failing to consider relevant factors or evidence before it?\n[27]\nMs. Collier submits that the IAD failed to consider a number of relevant factors. Briefly, the facts upon which Ms. Collier wishes to rely are as follows:\n- Once Ms. Collier became a Canadian citizen in 1991, she sponsored her three middle children, Jeriel, Jamie and Jiselle, to come to Canada. In the affidavit Ms. Collier swore for this judicial review, she deposed that, at the time she sponsored her three middle children, she informed Canadian immigration officials that she has five children (disclosure).\n- The applications for Ms. Collier's three children's applications were approved by the Respondent; they arrived in Canada in 1992 (acceptance).\n- The application for John was submitted in June 1999. Therefore, owing to the Respondent's inaction, the sponsorship application was delayed by three years prior to its refusal (delay).\n[28]\nMs. Collier submits that these arguments of disclosure, acceptance and delay are relevant to the decision making process. I disagree for the simple reason that evidence of these matters was not before the IAD. In her submission to the IAD, there is a vague reference to her other children. However, this reference is not supported by any documentary evidence.\n[29]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 72 F.T.R. 49 (T.D.), at para. 4, Justice Gibson held:\n\"It is trite law that judicial review of a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal should proceed on the basis of the evidence that was before the decision-maker.\"\n[30]\nFor this reason, it is not appropriate to consider this evidence in this judicial review. Further, it is unreasonable to expect that the IAD has a duty to follow up on the comments in the letter. Ms. Collier bore the burden of putting evidence she thought was relevant before the IAD.\n[31]\nHowever, even if I were to consider this evidence, I fail to see how it would have allowed the visa officer, in the first instance, or the IAD to circumvent the clear language of the\nRegulations\n.\nIssue #6: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the objectives of the IRPA in its interpretation of the applicable provisions?\n[32]\nOne of the objects stated in the\nIRPA\nis \"to see that families are reunited in Canada\" (s. 3(1)(d)). Ms. Collier submits that IAD failed to consider the object of family reunification in s. 3(1)(d) in its interpretation of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n.\n[33]\nSection 3 of the\nIRPA\ncannot be read in a vacuum. While I completely agree with Ms. Collier that statutory provisions should be read harmoniously with the object of a statute, this cannot occur at the expense of ignoring Parliament's intention, which is discernible in the wording of s. 117(9)(d) (Driedger, supra). The intentions of Parliament are to be discerned from the plain meaning of the words in the statute. In this case, those words clearly state that the dependents of a prospective immigrant are to be disclosed before or at the time of admission to Canada. The privileges that attach to the family member class are to be conferred only on those dependents about whom Canadian immigration authorities are made aware (\nNatt\n, supra at para. 14).\nConclusion\n[34]\nIn summary, both the visa officer and the IAD came to a correct determination of the law. Section 355 of the\nRegulations\nis intended to apply only to persons who were between 18 and 21 at the time of landing of their sponsors and does not apply to the facts of this case. Because of the operation of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n, the IAD had no jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Collier or the humanitarian and compassionate factors that may arise in this case. For these reasons, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.\n[35]\nNeither party proposed question for certification. None will be certified.\nORDER\n[36]\nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\n1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n2. No question of general importance is certified.\nApplication dismissed.\nEditor: Anick Ouellette-Levesque/gs\n[End of document]",
  "full_text_en": "[0] <CONTENT_MISSING>\n\n[1]\nSnider, J.\n: Ms. Collier has been hoping, since 1999, to bring her youngest son, John, to Canada from the Philippines. In 1986, Ms. Collier was granted permanent resident status in Canada and became a citizen in 1991. At that time, contrary to the legal requirement to list all her dependent children, Ms. Collier made no mention of her five children.\n\n[2]\nIn 1999, she commenced the process to sponsor her youngest son, John as a member of the \"family class\".\n\n[3]\nOn June 28, 2002, the new\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n(\"\nIRPA\n\") and\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n(\"\nRegulations\n\") came into force. The\nRegulations\ncontain a provision that was not included in former\nImmigration Act\nor\nRegulations\n. Section 117(9)(d) provides that a person will not be considered to be a member of the family class if that person was not examined at the time of the sponsor's application for permanent residence.\n\n[4]\nOn February 21, 2003, John's sponsored application for landing was refused on the basis that, due to Ms. Collier's failure to disclose his existence, John was not examined in connection with the application for landing .\n\n[5]\nMs. Collier appealed this decision. Each of the Respondent and Ms. Collier made very brief written submission. In its Notice of Decision and Reasons dated September 26, 2003, a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Immigration Appeal Division (\"IAD\") dismissed the appeal, stating that:\n\"On the basis of the information provided, the person who was sponsored by the appellant is not a member of the family class. Therefore, under s. 65 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, the IAD has no discretionary jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\"\n\n[6]\nMs. Collier seeks judicial review of this decision. In spite of very capable representations by Ms. Collier's counsel, I am unable to allow her application for the reasons that follow.\nIssues\n\n[7]\nThe Applicant raises the following issues:\n1. What is the applicable standard of review?\n2. Did the IAD err by failing to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the Applicant's sponsorship application?\n3. Did the IAD err by failing to consider the published policy of the Respondent, which clarifies the otherwise restrictive application of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n?\n4. Did the IAD err by failing to consider the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and the proposed amendments applicable to the\nRegulations\n?\n5. Did the IAD err by failing to consider relevant factors or evidence before it?\n6. Did the IAD err by failing to consider the objectives of the\nIRPA\nin its interpretation of the applicable provisions?\nAnalysis\nIssue #1: What is the applicable standard of review?\n\n[8]\nMs. Collier submits that a standard of correctness should be applied to a question such as this that involves jurisdiction. The issue of the interpretation of s. 355 is a question of statutory interpretation to which a standard of correctness should apply. However, ascertaining the IAD's jurisdiction to hear appeals from members of the family class required the IAD to consider the facts of this case and determine whether they are captured by s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n. Accordingly, this is an issue of mixed fact and law for which the standard of review is reasonableness simpliciter (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 191 F.T.R. 311 (T.D.), at para. 21).\nIssue #2: Did the IAD err by failing to apply s. 355 of the Regulations to the Applicant's sponsorship application?\n\n[9]\nMs. Collier submits that the IAD failed to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the application.\n\n[10]\nSection 355 of the\nRegulations\nis a transitional provision that only applies to applications made before June 28, 2002 when the\nIRPA\ncame into force. There is some difference of opinion as to when the sponsorship application was perfected. For purposes of this judicial review, I have assumed, without deciding, that the application was made in June, 2002, prior to the coming into force of the\nIRPA\n, and that I should, therefore, have regard to the transitional provisions. However, as discussed below, s. 355 does not assist Ms. Collier.\n\n[11]\nThe IAD has jurisdiction to hear the appeal of a \"person who has filed in the prescribed manner an application to sponsor a foreign national as a member of the family class\" (s. 63(1),\nIRPA\n). The IAD held that the operation of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRules\ndeprived it of any jurisdiction to hear Ms. Collier's appeal.\n\"No foreign national may be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if\n. . . . .\n(d) the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member ... of the sponsor and was not examined.\"\n\"The following persons are not considered to belong to the family reunification category due to their relationship with the sponsor:\n. . . . .\n(d) in the case where the sponsor became a permanent resident following an application to that effect, the foreign national who, at the time the application was made, was not the subject of a check and was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor or was a former spouse or former common-law partner of the sponsor.\"\n\n[12]\nMs. Collier admits that she did not disclose the existence of her five children on her application for permanent residence and, consequently, they were not examined by Canadian immigration officials. Thus, John falls squarely within s. 117(9)(d) and would not be a member of the \"family class\".\n\n[13]\nIn Ms. Collier's submission, however, s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nshields John from being caught by subsection 117(9)(d). She submits that s. 355 of the\nRegulations\npermits all those who applied for permanent residence under the former\nImmigration Act\nto sponsor dependents, irrespective of their existence being disclosed to Canadian immigration authorities. I disagree.\n\n[14]\nSection 355 of the\nRules\nmust be read in connection with s. 352 of the\nRules\n:\n\"A person is not required to include in an application ... a non-accompanying child who is not a dependent son ... within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the former Regulations and is a dependent child as defined in s. 2 of these Regulations if the application was made under the former Act before the day on which this section comes into force.\"\n\"A person who, before the coming into force of this section, made an application under the old Act is not required to mention in his or her application, if he or she does not accompany him or her, his or her common-law partner or any child -- who is a dependent child within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of these regulations -- who is not a 'dependent daughter' or a 'dependent son' within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the old regulations.\"\n\n[15]\nThe general age limit of a dependent child changed from someone who is 18 under s. 2(1) of the former\nRules\nto 21 under s. 2 of the new\nRules\n.\nSection 355 of the\nRules\nstates:\n\"If a person who made an application under the former Act before the day on which this section comes into force sponsors a non-accompanying dependent child, referred to section 352, who makes an application as a member of the family class ... paragraph 117(9)(d) does not apply in respect of that dependent child ...\" (emphasis mine)\n\"Paragraph 117(9)(d) of these Regulations does not apply to dependent children referred to in section 352 of these Regulations or to the common-law spouse of a person who is not accompanying the person and who is making an application under the family class or the spouse or common-law partner class in Canada if that person is sponsoring them and made an application under the old Act before the date on which this section comes into force.\"\n\n[16]\nMs. Collier rightly asserts that provisions of the\nIRPA\nare to be read in their context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the statute, its object, and Parliament's intention (R. Sullivan,\nSullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes\n, 4th Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 2002), at 2 (\"Driedger\"). It is precisely this imperative that leads me to read s. 355 in harmony with s. 352. Upon doing this, I conclude that s. 355 does not save John from the application of s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\n.\n\n[17]\nSection 355 is intended save an application from s. 117(9)(d) if it was filed under the former regulatory scheme and in accordance with the former definition of dependent child within that scheme. By this, I mean that a child who is between 19 and 21, although a dependent under the new\nRegulations\n, did not need to be included as a non-accompanying dependent child in the sponsor's application for landing under the former regulations. Put simply, the new age limit for dependent children under the new\nRegulations\ndoes not render defective an application filed in accordance with the old regulatory scheme and before the\nRegulations\ncame into force. This protection is inapplicable to Ms. Collier's situation; John was not between the ages of 19 and 21 in 1986 when Ms. Collier became a permanent resident. The IAD did not err by failing to apply s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nto the facts of this case.\n\n[18]\nA recent decision of this Court supports this reasoning.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 254 F.T.R. 122 (F.C.), Justice Martineau of this Court held that, where a sponsor fails to declare his or her dependants before landing in Canada, s. 117(9)(d) of the\nRegulations\nprecludes inclusion of those dependents in the \"family class\" for the purpose of an application for permanent residence. Justice Martineau confirmed in this decision that it would be contrary to the express language of the\nRegulations\nto require the IAD to consider s. 355.\n\n[19]\nThe IAD correctly interpreted s. 117(9)(d) of the\nIRPA\nand s. 355 of the\nRegulations\nand correctly applied the facts of this case to those provisions.\nIssue #3: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the published policy of the Respondent,which clarifies the otherwise restrictive application of s. 117(9)(d) of the Regulations?\n\n[20]\nOn June 23, 2003, the Respondent published an Operations Memoranda, Overseas Processing, (the \"OP Manual\") that sought to clarify the application of s. 117(9)(d). The OP Manual states:\n\"The applicant should have been fully counselled by the visa officer on the consequences of not having the child examined, i.e., exclusion from later sponsorship in the family class by the applicant. The CAIPS notes must reflect this counselling took place.\n. . . . .\n\"In cases where, upon review, it is not clear that the applicant in fact made the choice not to have the child examined and it is not clear that the applicant understood the consequences of the choice, a review board may conclude that the visa officer was in breach and that the applicant was not correctly advised.

Where CIC chose not to examine the family member because of an administrative decision or due to an administrative error or for policy reasons, the family member would not be excluded from membership in the family class.\"\n\n[21]\nMs. Collier submits that, in its interpretation of the scope and application of s. 117(9)(d), the IAD had an obligation at law to consider the OP Manual. This submission, even if accepted, does not advance Ms. Collier's case. Upon carefully reading the OP Manual to which Ms. Collier directs this Court's attention, I believe that it offers guidance to Canadian immigration officials on how to advise those who disclose the existence of their non-accompanying dependents at the time they apply for permanent residence in Canada and who elect not to have the child examined. For further clarity, the final paragraph cited above states explicitly that s. 117(9)(d) is intended to exclude family members who were consciously excluded from an applicant's application. That covers the case of Ms. Collier who, in 1985, consciously chose not to disclose the existence of her children. She cannot now rely on the OP Manual to assist her.\n\n[22]\nIn 1991, Ms. Collier successfully sponsored three of her children to come to Canada, at which time she disclosed to immigration officials the existence of her other two children, including John born in 1985. Ms. Collier submits that, owing to her disclosure in 1991 when she sponsored three of her children, the OP Manual obliged Canadian immigration officials to advise her of the consequences of not having her non-accompanying dependent children examined. On my reading of the OP Manual, the obligation of Canadian immigration officials, if it exists, only arises when disclosure of non-accompanying dependents is made in the sponsor's own application for permanent residence in Canada. For Ms. Collier, that was in 1985 and not when she sponsored her other three children in 1991.\n\n[23]\nIn any event, a policy of the Respondent cannot be in conflict with the words of a statutory provision. Thus, even if the policy read as proposed by Ms. Collier, it would likely be ultra vires and of no force.\nIssue #4: Did the IAD err by failing to consider the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and the proposed amendments applicable to the Regulations, which were published in Part 1 of the Canada Gazette?\n\n[24]\nThe Applicant submits that IAD failed to take into account the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement published in Part I of the Canada Gazette on September 27, 2003 (\"RIAS\") which was published with the\nRegulations\nand which supports the interpretation of the\nRegulations\nproposed by Ms. Collier.\n\n[25]\nThe RIAS contained, inter alia, the following objective and means to its realization:\n\"...Ensure that some family members who were not examined\nas part of their sponsor's application for immigration to Canada\nare not excluded from the family class;\n. . . . .\n\"The amendments to s. 117 of the\nRules\nensure that certain family members who were not examined as part of a sponsor's application for immigration to Canada are no longer excluded from the family class and could be sponsored.

These people were not initially screened because\nthat they were not subject to this obligation for administrative or political reasons.\nThis change affects family members of refugees, people who have submitted an application to Canada for humanitarian reasons as well as those who submitted an application before the entry into force of the\nIRPA\n.\"\n\n[26]\nSimilar to my comments about the OP Manual, when the relevant portions of the RIAS are read carefully, it appearsthat the proposed amendments apply to cases where a family member is not examined as part of his or her sponsor's application for immigration to Canada because of administrative or policy reasons. In this case, John was not examined as part of Ms. Collier's application for immigration to Canada because of her failure to disclose his existence to the immigration officials who processed her application for landing. The failure to examine John at the time that Ms. Collier came to Canada in 1986 cannot be attributed to administrative or policy reasons.

      "An individual became a permanent resident of Canada in 1986 and a citizen in 1991.",
      "At the time of becoming a permanent resident, the individual did not disclose information about all of her children.",
      "In 1999, the individual initiated a sponsorship application for her youngest son to immigrate to Canada.",
      "New immigration legislation and regulations came into effect in 2002, including a provision regarding examination of family members during the sponsor's initial application.",
      "The sponsorship application for the son was refused in 2003 because the son had not been examined during the sponsor's original application for permanent residence.",
      "The sponsor appealed the refusal, but the appeal was dismissed by the Immigration and Refugee Board.",
      "The sponsor subsequently sought judicial review of the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision.",
      "The sponsor had previously sponsored three other children in 1991, at which time she disclosed the existence of all her children, including the son in question.",
      "The sponsor argued that a transitional provision in the regulations should apply to her case.",
      "The sponsor submitted that she was not fully informed of the consequences of not having her son examined during her initial application."

        "The IAD erred by failing to consider the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and proposed amendments to the Regulations.",
        "The IAD erred by failing to consider relevant factors and evidence, specifically: disclosure of other children in 1991, acceptance of those children's applications, and delay in processing John's application.",
        "The IAD erred by failing to consider the objectives of the IRPA, particularly the objective of family reunification.",

      "Respondents": [
        "Section 355 of the Regulations applies only to applications made before June 28, 2002, and does not assist Ms. Collier.",
        "John falls squarely within section 117(9)(d) of the Regulations because Ms. Collier did not disclose his existence on her initial application.",
        "The OP Manual applies to cases where a family member was consciously excluded from the application, which is the case here.",
        "The RIAS applies to cases where a family member was not examined due to administrative or policy reasons, not due to non-disclosure.",
        "Evidence of disclosure, acceptance, and delay was not before the IAD and cannot be considered now.",
        "Parliament's intention, as expressed in section 117(9)(d), is to require disclosure of dependents before or at the time of admission to Canada.",
        "The IAD correctly interpreted section 117(9)(d) of the IRPA and section 355 of the Regulations."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The central issue revolved around whether the Immigration and Refugee Board (IAD) erred in refusing to consider Ms. Collier’s sponsorship application for her son, John, based on section 117(9)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Regulations). The court affirmed the IAD’s decision, finding that John fell squarely within the scope of that section.",
      "The court determined the applicable standard of review was reasonableness simpliciter for the factual application of the law, and correctness for statutory interpretation. This distinction was important in assessing whether the IAD’s application of the Regulations was appropriate.",
      "The court rejected Ms. Collier’s argument that section 355 of the Regulations shielded John from section 117(9)(d). It interpreted section 355 in conjunction with section 352, concluding that section 355 only applied to cases where a child was between 18 and 21 at the time the sponsor initially applied for permanent residence, and the application was made under the former regulatory scheme. John did not meet this criteria.",
      "The court found that Ms. Collier’s failure to disclose her children’s existence in her initial 1986 application for permanent residence meant John was not subject to examination, triggering the application of section 117(9)(d). This was a direct consequence of her initial omission.",
      "The court dismissed the relevance of an Operations Manual published by the Respondent, finding it applied to situations where applicants *disclosed* non-accompanying dependents but chose not to have them examined, which was not the case here. Ms. Collier had not disclosed John’s existence initially.",
      "Similarly, the court found a Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) irrelevant because it pertained to cases where non-examination was due to administrative or policy reasons, not a deliberate omission by the applicant.",
      "The court refused to consider new evidence presented regarding disclosure, acceptance, and delay, stating that it was not before the IAD and judicial review is based on the record before the decision-maker.",
      "The court acknowledged the objective of family reunification in the IRPA but held that it could not override the clear language of section 117(9)(d), which prioritized disclosure of dependents at the time of the sponsor’s application. The court emphasized that Parliament’s intention, as expressed in the statute’s wording, was paramount."
