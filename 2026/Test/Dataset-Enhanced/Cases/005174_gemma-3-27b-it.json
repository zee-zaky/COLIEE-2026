    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nNear, J.\nSeptember 12, 2011.\nCounsel:\nDaniel Radin, for the applicants;\nTessa Kroeker, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nDaniel Radin, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicants;\nMyles J. Kirvan, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nNear, J.\n: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated February 2, 2011. The Board determined that the applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, RS 2001, c 27 (IRPA).",
    "[2]\nFor the following reasons, this application is dismissed.\nI.\nFacts",
    "[3]\nSlavomir Gregor (the Principal Applicant) and his wife, Lucie Kovacikova, and their children, Kristyna Gregorava and Nela Gregorova, are citizens of the Czech Republic. They arrived in Canada and filed claims for refugee protection on May 19, 2009.",
    "[4]\nThe Principal Applicant claims he experienced persecution in the Czech Republic because of his Roma ethnicity. His Personal Information Form (PIF) and oral testimony disclose incidents of verbal and physical assaults by skinheads.",
    "[5]\nIn 1996, he was kicked to the back of a streetcar and subjected to insults. He received medical attention for his injuries at the local hospital and reported the incident to police. He claims that police told him there was nothing they could do for him since no one witnessed the assault.",
    "[6]\nMore recently in 2006, a group of skinheads shouted racial slurs at him and his family traveling together on a streetcar. In 2008, he also sought treatment from his family doctor for injuries sustained when he was thrown from another streetcar. According to his testimony, he reported this incident to police who laughed at him.",
    "[7]\nIn addition to the assaults, the Principal Applicant states that he has had difficulty finding employment and been continuously laid off because of his ethnic background. He reports being refused service at a bar and turned away from nightclubs.\nII.\nDecision",
    "[8]\nThe Board concluded that the Principal Applicant did not have a well founded fear of persecution if returned to the Czech Republic. Although the Applicants were discriminated against, and even harassed, as a result of their Roma ethnicity, the incidents did not rise to the level of persecution. There was no persuasive evidence of sustained or systematic violation of the Applicant's basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.",
    "[9]\nMoreover, the Board found that there was adequate state protection available to the Applicants. Since the Czech Republic is a democratic state, there was a greater onus on the Applicants to establish that they had exhausted all available courses of action. Local failures of effective policing, such as being unable to stop the incidents, would not amount to a lack of state protection, unless part of a broader pattern of the state's inability or refusal to provide protection.",
    "[10]\nThe Board noted that although there was evidence of increased skinhead attacks on minority groups, the Czech Republic did not condone this behaviour and was making efforts to correct its record of discrimination against the Roma. Programs put in place by the Czech Republic represented serious efforts to offer protection for the Roma people.\nIII.\nIssues",
    "[11]\nThis application raises two issues:\n(a) Was it reasonable for the Board to conclude that discrimination experienced by the Applicants did not amount to persecution?\n(b) Was the Board's assessment concerning the availability of state protection to the Applicants in the Czech Republic reasonable?\nIV.\nStandard of Review",
    "[12]\nThe distinction between discrimination and persecution is a question of mixed fact and law reviewed on a standard of reasonableness (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] FCJ No 572 at paras 12-15). The same standard applies in the assessment of state protection (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para 47, reasonableness is \"concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\" as well as \"whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.\"\nV.\nAnalysis\nIssue A: Was it Reasonable for the Board to Conclude that Discrimination Experienced by the Applicants did not Amount to Persecution?",
    "[13] <CONTENT_MISSING>",
    "[14]\nPersecution is understood as the \"sustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 316 at para 3).",
    "[15]\nThe Applicants submit that the Board failed to properly assess the cumulative effect of the discrimination they experienced before concluding that it did not to amount to persecution. In addition, the Applicants contend that the Board should have explicitly addressed conflicting documentary evidence.",
    "[16]\nThe Board is expected to assess the cumulative effects of discriminatory incidents and explain why they do not amount to persecution (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 652 at para 31;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR 154 at para 27). However, I am satisfied by the Respondent's submission that the Board met this expectation in the present case. The Board considered the discrimination as a whole. It stated that there were several incidents of physical and verbal assaults and proceeded to list them, focusing attention on the most serious ones. These incidents were balanced against evidence that the Applicant was not denied medical treatment or prevented from bringing information to the attention of the police. Indeed, the Board clarified its approach to assessing the discriminatory incidents at paragraph 12 of its reasons stating that although \"the treatment the claimants received for being of Roma ethnicity must have been difficult to go through, it does not, even cumulatively, amount to persecution.\"",
    "[17]\nAlthough the Board did not explicitly mention the country documentation in its analysis of persecution, it is evident from the remainder of the decision that this material was considered. The Board acknowledged the historical discrimination against Roma as well as increased incidents of skinhead attacks on Roma later in the decision. This implies that evidence of the situation facing Roma in the Czech Republic was considered as part of the Board's overall assessment of the case. It was also balanced against evidence of efforts on the part of the state to address the problem.",
    "[18]\nIn distinguishing discrimination from persecution, the Court must be guided by <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, where it was stated at paragraph 4 that it is the Board's role to reach a conclusion by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements, the intervention of the Court is unwarranted unless that conclusion is capricious or unreasonable.",
    "[19]\nHaving balanced the cumulative effect of discrimination and the situation facing the Roma in the Czech Republic, it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the Applicants experienced discrimination but it was not sufficiently serious or systematic to amount to persecution. The intervention of the Court is not warranted.\nIssue B: Was the Board's Assessment Concerning the Availability of State Protection to the Applicants in the Czech Republic Reasonable?",
    "[20]\nThe Applicants submit that the Board's assessment concerning the availability of state protection was unreasonable because it did not consider all of the evidence. Specifically, the Applicants charge that the Board was selective in its treatment of country documents. They point to evidence of ongoing discrimination and negative perceptions among the police of Roma in the Czech Republic that was not explicitly analyzed.",
    "[21]\nThe Applicants further submit that the Board failed to address their unsuccessful attempts to seek protection, particularly evidence that police laughed at the Principal Applicant in 2008 when he attempted to report an assault.",
    "[22]\nThe Respondent takes the position that the Board thoroughly considered all of this evidence. The Board recognized discrimination faced by Roma generally and recent attacks by extremists. It noted that the Czech Republic did not condone recent attacks and was making serious efforts, through a variety of programs aimed at improving police recruiting and assistance as well as promoting social inclusion, to correct past discrimination. It recognized conflicting evidence stating that \"critics claim these programs do not go far enough or are just superficial\" but still found that \"the preponderance of evidence is that there are programs in effect and serious efforts are being made.\"",
    "[23]\nDemocratic governments are not expected to guarantee the protection of all citizens at all times (\nCanada (Minister of Employment and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 150 NR 232 at 223;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CarswellNat 2216 at paras 4-5 (FCA)). In considering the evidence of ongoing discrimination as well as efforts designed to assist the Roma, it was reasonable for the Board to weigh this evidence and conclude there was state protection was available, however imperfect.",
    "[24]\nSimilarly, local failures of state protection do not necessarily imply that state protection is unavailable (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , 2000 Carswell 706 at para 31). The Board mentioned that the Principal Applicant reported the incidents to the police and there was no information that they were refused protection. No witnesses were available to enable the police to investigate the assault. The Board did not specifically refer to the police laughing at him when he reported the second physical assault, but this would not undermine the broader conclusion. The Applicants could have pursued the matter further given the state-wide programs in place to assist the Roma.",
    "[25]\nWhile the Applicants would have preferred the Board place greater emphasis on certain evidence of ongoing discrimination and attempts to seek state protection, since these were considered and perfection is not required, the Board's conclusion that state protection was available to the Applicants in the Czech Republic is reasonable.\nVI.\nConclusion",
    "[26]\nThe Board reasonably concluded that the Applicants did not have a well founded fear of persecution and state protection was available to them.",
    "[27]\nAccordingly, this application for judicial review is dismissed.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[28]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthis application for judicial review is dismissed.\n[End of document]"

      "The court upheld the Refugee Protection Division’s (Board) decision denying the applicants’ claim for refugee status, finding the Board’s reasoning was reasonable.",
      "The court affirmed that the threshold for establishing persecution requires a ‘sustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection,’ and determined the Board correctly applied this standard.",
      "The court found the Board appropriately considered the cumulative effect of the discriminatory incidents experienced by the applicants, acknowledging the incidents while concluding they did not rise to the level of persecution, balancing them against evidence the applicants were not denied medical treatment or prevented from reporting incidents to police.",
      "The court determined the Board’s consideration of country documentation was reasonable, even without explicit mention in the analysis, as the Board acknowledged historical discrimination and recent attacks against Roma people, alongside state efforts to address the issue.",
      "The court clarified that democratic governments are not required to guarantee protection ‘at all times’ and that the Board reasonably weighed evidence of ongoing discrimination against the Czech Republic’s efforts to improve protection for Roma people, concluding state protection was available, albeit imperfect.",
      "The court reasoned that isolated failures of police response (e.g., not investigating assaults due to lack of witnesses, alleged laughter from police) do not automatically equate to a lack of state protection, especially given the existence of broader state-wide programs aimed at assisting the Roma population; the applicants could have pursued further action.",
      "The court applied the reasonableness standard of review, emphasizing that intervention is unwarranted unless the Board’s conclusion is ‘capricious or unreasonable,’ and found the Board’s decision fell within an acceptable range of outcomes given the facts and law."
