    "[1]\nCrampton, C.J.\n: This case is yet another example of why something needs to be done to address the unacceptable state of affairs concerning the test for citizenship in this country.",
    "[2]\nThe optimal resolution of this state of affairs would be for Parliament to legislate a clearer test for citizenship under the\nCitizenship Act\n, RSC 1985 c C-29. The Court has noted this on several occasions\n(\nsee, for example,\nHarry (Re)\n[1998] FCJ No 189, at paras 15-26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nHao\n]; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Another potential approach would be for a citizenship judge to bring a reference to the Court under subsection 18.3(1) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, RSC 1985, c F-7 [\nFC Act\n]. Among other things, this would provide an opportunity for the issue to then be brought before the Federal Court of Appeal, pursuant to paragraph 27(1)(d) of the\nFC Act\n, to finally settle the divergence in this Court's jurisprudence that has persisted now for several decades.\n1.\nOverview",
    "[3]\nThe Applicant, Ms. Huang, is appealing an adverse determination by a citizenship judge of her application for citizenship.",
    "[4]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge erred by:\ni. breaching the principles of procedural fairness in handling her case;\nii. failing to properly assess her residence in Canada; and\niii. failing to properly assess her proficiency in English.",
    "[5]\nI disagree. For the reasons that follow, this appeal is dismissed.\n2.\nBackground Facts",
    "[6]\nMs. Huang is a citizen of China. She arrived in Canada on February 26, 2005, on an investor class visa.",
    "[7]\nAfter several trips back and forth between Canada and China, including two in which she gave birth to a child here, she applied for Canadian citizenship on August 6, 2009.",
    "[8]\nAccordingly, the relevant period [Relevant Period] for the purposes of calculating her residence was from August 6, 2005 to August 6, 2009.\n3.\nRelevant legislation",
    "[9]\nSubsection 5(1) of the\nCitizenship Act\nsets forth a conjunctive test for citizenship. That provision states:\nThe Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n(a) makes application for citizenship;\n(b) is eighteen years of age or over;\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and\n(f) is not under a removal order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20.",
    "[10]\nPursuant to subsection 14(6), and subject to section 20 (which is not relevant to this case), no appeal lies from a decision of this Court on an appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge.\n4.\nStandard of Review",
    "[11]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to procedural fairness is reviewable on a standard of correctness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 55 and 79 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 43).",
    "[12]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to the citizenship judge's assessment of Ms. Huang's residence in Canada has two prongs. Generally speaking, the first prong concerns the legal test for citizenship, namely, whether it was open to the citizenship judge to apply a particular test. That is a question of law which concerns the interpretation of section 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nand this Court's jurisprudence.",
    "[13]\nIn interpreting the\nCitizenship Act\n, a citizenship judge is interpreting either his or her \"home statute\" or a statute closely connected with the judge's function, and with which he or she can be presumed to have particular familiarity. The Supreme Court of Canada's jurisprudence teaches that, absent exceptional circumstances, determinations reached by administrative tribunals in this context should be presumed to be reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 34 [\nAlberta Teachers\n]).",
    "[14]\nOne such exceptional circumstance is where the question of law is \"of central importance to the legal system as a whole and ... outside the adjudicator's expertise\" (\nAlberta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 30, 34 and 43).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nMartinez\n], Justice Rennie concluded, in\nobiter\n, that the interpretation of section 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nis such a question. While I am very sympathetic to his reasoning, I am reluctant to embrace it because the Supreme Court subsequently noted that it had yet to encounter the type of exceptional situation involving statutory interpretation that would merit review on a standard of correctness\n(Alberta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 34; see also\nHao\n, above, at para 39).",
    "[15]\nAs noted above, the issue of the legal test for citizenship concerns not only the interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act,\nbut also the interpretation of this Court's extensive jurisprudence on this issue.",
    "[16]\nThe specific question of law that has been raised by Ms. Huang is whether the Citizenship judge was entitled to apply the test articulated by this Court in\nKoo (Re)\n[1993] 1 FC 286, at para 10 [\nKoo\n].",
    "[17]\nAs discussed in part 5.B of these reasons below, the test set forth in\nKoo\n, above, is one of three tests for citizenship that have long been established in this Court's jurisprudence. It is a qualitative test that is similar to one of the other tests, and is very different from the third test (the \"physical presence\" test), which is quantitative in nature.",
    "[18]\nThese three tests continue to be embraced by this Court. The ongoing existence of this divergence of views within the Court reflects a very peculiar state of the law that developed and has persisted in part due to the fact that, pursuant to subsection 14(6) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, no appeal lies from a decision of this Court on an appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge.",
    "[19]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLam\n], Justice Lutfy, as he then was, took note of this \"conflicting jurisprudence,\" which essentially pertains to the proper interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n. He observed, at paragraph 11, that \"[t]he divergence of views, both in this Court and among citizenship judges, has brought uncertainty to the administration of justice in these matters.\" However, given that legislation which would have clarified the citizenship test was then pending, he concluded that, during the period of transition, deference should be accorded to a citizenship judge's choice of which of the three tests to apply, provided that he or she demonstrates an understanding of the case law and properly decides that the facts meet the test that has been applied (\nLam\n, above, at para 33).",
    "[20]\nA decade later, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], at paragraph 44, Justice Mainville observed that over the course of the intervening period the approach adopted by Justice Lutfy had been largely followed. However, after noting that the decision in\nLam\nhad been \"rendered in a situation that was perceived to be temporary given the statutory amendments that were under consideration at that time,\" he concluded that the time had come to settle upon a single interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) if the\nCitizenship Act\n. To this end, and after observing that the test set forth in\nKoo\nhad become the dominant test in this Court's jurisprudence, he concluded that this test should henceforth be the sole test to be applied under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n). He reached that conclusion notwithstanding his view that the \"physical presence test,\" discussed below, appears to have been contemplated by the clear wording of that provision.",
    "[21]\nAs it has turned out, Justice Mainville's laudable \"attempt to standardize the applicable law\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47), has not been successful. In short, while his view that the\nKoo\ntest should be the sole standard has been endorsed in several subsequent decisions of this Court (see for example, the cases listed in\nHao\n, above, at para 42, and in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Khader\n]; see also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 32), a citizenship judge's discretion to apply one of the other recognized tests has been upheld in several other decisions (see, for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nHao\n, above, at paras 48-50;\nEl  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 23;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSaad\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).",
    "[22]\nIndeed, this Court has held in a number of other decisions that the \"physical presence\" test, discussed below, is the correct test to apply (\nMartinez\n, above, at para 52;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[23]\nIn other decisions, the Court appears to have adopted a hybrid approach, which would require a citizenship judge to proceed to conduct a qualitative assessment, as contemplated by the\nKoo\ntest, even if the \"physical presence\" test has been selected by the citizenship judge and failed by the applicant (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[24]\nWhat is clear from the foregoing is that the jurisprudence pertaining to the test(s) for citizenship remains divided and somewhat unsettled.",
    "[25]\nIn this context, it is particularly appropriate that deference be accorded to a citizenship judge's decision to apply any of the three tests that have a long and rich heritage in this Court's jurisprudence.",
    "[26]\nThis conclusion is consistent with the dominant view in this Court that the standard to be applied in reviewing a citizenship judge's decision reasonableness (\nSaad\n, above, at para 9;\nHao\n, above, at para 13; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 8; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13).",
    "[27]\nThe second prong of the issue that has been raised regarding the citizenship judge's assessment of Ms. Huang's application for citizenship concerns the application of the legal test for citizenship to the facts of this case. That is a question of mixed fact and law that is also reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.",
    "[28]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to whether the Citizenship judge erred by failing to properly assess her proficiency in English is also a question of mixed fact and law that is subject to review on a standard of reasonableness.\n5.\nAnalysis\nA.\nDid the citizenship judge breach the principles of procedural fairness in handling Ms. Huang's case?",
    "[29]\nMs. Huang submits that her procedural fairness rights were breached because she was not given adequate notice of her interview with the Citizenship judge, and because the interview notice did not advise her of the purpose of the interview. I disagree.",
    "[30]\nIn a letter dated October 25, 2010, Ms. Huang was advised that the citizenship judge required further information and that further processing of her application could not continue until she supplied that information.",
    "[31]\nThen, on February 21, 2011, Ms. Huang was advised by way of a form letter that the information she had supplied had been reviewed and that the citizenship judge requested a hearing to finalize the processing of her application. That letter also advised that her appointment with the Citizenship judge was \"for residency assessment.\"",
    "[32]\nOn April 4, 2011, Ms. Huang received a Notice to Appear from the Citizenship Office in Vancouver, requesting her to appear for an interview the following day. Among other things, that notice stated that she would \"be asked questions to determine if [she had] an adequate knowledge of English or French and an adequate knowledge of Canada.\" In addition, the notice stated: \"If you do not attend this hearing, at the above date, time and place, you will receive a second and final notice.\"",
    "[33]\nIn my view, the Notice to Appear sent on April 4, 2011 must be viewed together with the form letter that was sent on February 21, 2011. When those two written communications are viewed together, it is clear that Ms. Huang was given more than adequate notice to appear for her interview. She was also clearly informed that residency and language issues would be addressed during that interview. With this in mind, and given that she was informed that she would be given another opportunity to appear if she did not appear for her scheduled interview on April 5, 2011, her procedural fairness rights were not breached by virtue of the amount of notice she was given or the topics that were covered in the interview.",
    "[34]\nMy conclusion in this regard is reinforced by the fact that, following her interview, Ms. Huang was provided an opportunity to supply further information. In addition, she does not appear to have objected, at the time of her interview, to the short notice that had been given in the Notice to Appear, and she was accompanied by an interpreter.",
    "[35]\nMs. Huang also asserts that the citizenship judge did not conduct herself in an objective and independent manner. This allegation appears to rest on the fact that the citizenship judge re-tested Ms. Huang's knowledge of English and knowledge of Canada during the interview, notwithstanding that she had passed a prior written test. Given the nature of the written notices, summarized above, that she received, I am satisfied that the citizenship judge's decision to re-test Ms. Huang on these matters during the interview did not breach her procedural fairness rights.\nB.\nDid the Citizenship judge fail to properly assess Ms. Huang's residence in Canada?\ni.\nThe test for citizenship that was applied",
    "[36]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge erred by applying the test articulated in\nKoo\n, above, rather than the \"physical presence\" test. I disagree.",
    "[37]\nAs noted above, the jurisprudence of this Court has established three tests for citizenship. These are generally known as the \"centralized mode of living\" test, the\nKoo\ntest (which focuses upon where the applicant \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\") and the \"physical presence\" test.",
    "[38]\nIt is now well established that before any of these tests can be applied, an applicant for citizenship must establish that he or she is physically resident in Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 50;\nMartinez\n, above, at para 9;\nHao\n, above, at para 24; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13).",
    "[39]\nThe \"centralized mode of living test\" was articulated by Associate Chief Justice Thurlow, as he then was, in\nPapadogiorgakis (Re)\n, [1978] 2 FC 208, at paras 16-17 [\nPapadogiorgakis\n]. This test is a qualitative test that focuses upon \"the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question,\" even though the person may have lengthy absences from Canada.",
    "[40]\nThe \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" test was established by Justice Reed, in\nKoo\n, above, at para 10, who identified six factors to guide the assessment of whether this test has been met in any given case. Those factors will be discussed in the next section of these reasons below.",
    "[41]\nThe \"physical presence\" test is commonly attributed to Justice Muldoon, who stated in\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] FCJ No 232, at paras 3-9 [\nPourghasemi\n], that paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\nrequires, among other things, that an applicant for citizenship be physically present for a minimum of three years (1,095 days) in the four year period immediately preceding his application.",
    "[42]\nIn\nLam\n, above, Justice Lutfy, as he then was, held that \"it is open to the citizenship judge to adopt either one of the conflicting schools in this Court and, if the facts of the case were properly applied to the principles of the chose approach, the decision of the citizenship judge would not be wrong\" (\nLam\n, above, at para 14).",
    "[43]\nAs it turned out, the proposed legislation discussed in\nLam\nwas not enacted. Nevertheless, in my view, a reasonable interpretation of this Court's jurisprudence is that the law as articulated by Justice Lutfy has not changed with respect to a citizenship judge's ability to apply any one of the three tests for citizenship described above (see the second line of cases referred to at paragraph 21 above). I have reached this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that I personally find the reasoning in\nMartinez\n, above, and its progeny to be compelling. As noted at paragraph 22 above, that line of jurisprudence holds that the physical presence test is the correct test to apply, and is indeed the only one contemplated by paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.",
    "[44]\nHowever, with respect to those who hold a contrary view, I do not believe that this Court's jurisprudence, on balance, supports an approach that would effectively\nrequire\na blending of two or more of the three aforementioned tests (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 31). For example, if a citizenship judge decides to apply the physical presence test and concludes that the applicant in question did not meet that test, it would be inconsistent with a fair reading of the main branches of this Court's jurisprudence (namely, the approaches set forth in\nPapadogiorgakis, Pourghasemi, Koo\nand\nLam,\nrespectively, and in their respective progenies) for the citizenship judge to be\nrequired\nto then apply the\nKoo\ntest or the \"centralized mode of living test.\" This would effectively require the citizenship judge to give the applicant \"two kicks at the can.\" In the present state of the Court's jurisprudence, it would be reasonably open to the citizenship judge to terminate the assessment under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\nupon concluding that the physical presence test had not been met by the applicant.",
    "[45]\nIn this case, that is not what happened. The citizenship judge appears to have decided to not apply the physical presence test, after concluding that she was not satisfied that the information provided by Ms. Huang accurately reflected the number of days that she was, in fact, physically present in Canada. She therefore decided to apply the\nKoo\ntest. Under the longstanding jurisprudence of this Court, she was at liberty to do so. Stated differently, it was reasonably open for her to do so. This was well \"within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). This aspect of the decision under review was also reasonably justified, transparent and intelligible.",
    "[46]\nMs. Huang also takes issue with the citizenship judge's use of the words \"in fact,\" and asserts that this imposed a higher threshold than a \"balance of probabilities.\" I disagree.",
    "[47]\nThe citizenship judge explicitly stated that she was \"not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities\" that the information supplied by Ms. Huang accurately reflected the number of days that she was, in fact, physically present in Canada. Based on my reading of the decision as a whole, I am satisfied that she did not apply a standard different from the balance of probabilities standard she stated she had applied.\ni.\nThe Citizenship judge's application of the Koo test to the facts in the record",
    "[48]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge misapprehended several aspects of the evidentiary record and, that as a result of those errors, the conclusion that she had not satisfied the test for citizenship was unreasonable. I disagree.",
    "[49]\nIn\nKoo\n, above, Justice Reed identified the following six questions to be addressed in determining whether an applicant for citizenship \"regularly, normally or customarily\" lives in Canada:\ni. Was the individual physically present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences which occurred immediately before the application for citizenship?\nii. Where are the applicant's immediate family and dependents (and extended family) resident?\niii. Does the pattern of physical presence in Canada indicate a returning home or merely visiting the country?\niv. What is the extent of the physical absences - if an applicant is only a few days short of the 1,095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence than if those absences are extensive?\nv. Is the physical absence caused by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, accompanying a spouse who has accepted employment abroad?\nvi. What is the quality of the connection with Canada: is it more substantial than that which exists with any other country?",
    "[50]\nWith respect to the first factor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang had only been in Canada for a total of 99 days prior to the Relevant Period, and that this did not constitute a \"long period\" as contemplated by\nKoo\n, above. Ms. Huang did not take issue with this finding.",
    "[51]\nWith respect to the second factor, the citizenship judge concluded that the applicant lives with her husband, daughter and two sons in China, where her parents, her two sisters and her extended family also live. The citizenship judge also noted that Ms. Huang has no relatives living in Canada. Ms. Huang did not take issue with this finding.",
    "[52]\nTurning to the third factor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang's travel history between China and Canada reflects that her home is in China, and that she simply visited Canada for the purpose of giving birth to two of her children here, and to give her eldest and middle children the opportunity to attend school and preschool here. In my view, this conclusion is entirely consistent with the facts in the record.",
    "[53]\nIn reaching that conclusion, the citizenship judge identified a number of inconsistencies in the materials that had been submitted by Ms. Huang in support of her application. For example, in her Residence Questionnaire, she indicated that she resided in Canada with her husband from February 2005 until November 21, 2010, and that, from May 2006 to the end of that period she lived at a particular address in Richmond, British Columbia from May 2006. However, during the hearing, she acknowledged that her husband returned to live in China in 2005, that he only returned for a few months each year to live with her and that she returned to live with him on August 21, 2009.",
    "[54]\nIn the course of reaching her conclusion with respect to this third\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge also questioned some of the documentation that Ms. Huang had provided to support her position that she was present in Canada between April 8, 2006 and June 6, 2006. Ms. Huang asserts that this aspect of the citizenship judge's analysis was unreasonable. I will deal with Ms. Huang's submissions in this regard below, as this aspect of the citizenship judge's analysis overlaps with her assessment of the fourth\nKoo\nfactor.",
    "[55]\nIn assessing the fourth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang fell 54 days short of the 1,095 days specified in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. She reached this conclusion after stating that she had not been convinced that Ms. Huang had been present in Canada for the 59 day period between April 8, 2006 and June 7, 2006 [Disputed Period].",
    "[56]\nAs noted above, Ms. Huang asserts that this finding was not reasonable. In particular, Ms. Huang states that, based on the fact that her passport was stamped with an exit stamp from China on April 8, 2006 and did not contain entry stamps or visas from other countries during that period immediately following that date, the only reasonable conclusion available to the citizenship judge was that she entered Canada on that date and remained there until her next declared trip. I disagree.",
    "[57]\nMs. Huang's passport reflects a very active travel history, including to Australia, Malaysia, and the United States. Among her declared absences from Canada during the Relevant Period, four were to the United States (Certified Tribunal Record, at p 128). Particularly in this context, it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to fail to infer that Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period, simply because she was not in China. The burden was on Ms. Huang's to establish on a balance of probabilities the number of days that she was in Canada. Contrary to Ms. Huang's position, the exit stamp from China in her passport is not \"reliable proof as far as her travel in and out of Canada is concerned.\"",
    "[58]\nMs. Huang also takes issue with the citizenship judge's statement that \"[t]here is no supporting evidence or documentation to show that the applicant was resident in Canada between August 6, 2005 and June 7, 2006.\"",
    "[59]\nAfter making that statement, the citizenship judge acknowledged that Ms. Huang came to Canada for 49 days between October 22, 2005 and December 10, 2005. Ms. Huang therefore only takes issue with respect to the period April 8, 2006 and June 7, 2006.",
    "[60]\nBased on my reading of this part of the citizenship judge's decision as a whole, I am satisfied that what the citizenship judge meant is that there was no supporting evidence or documentation to\npersuasively establish\nthat Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period. The citizenship judge appropriately discussed the principal documentation that Ms. Huang relies upon to establish her presence in Canada during that period. However, the citizenship judge reasonably concluded that it did not establish such presence.",
    "[61]\nThe documentation in question included information with respect to credit card activity that reflected transactions to purchase a car and car insurance on April 16, 2006 and April 30, 2006. That information did not reflect any other transactions in Canada until June 7, 2006, whereas other information that had been provided reflected significant activity in Canada on Ms. Huang's MasterCard during the aforementioned 49 day period that she was in Canada in late 2005.",
    "[62]\nOther documentation included a car purchase document that the citizenship judge found to be very faded, difficult to read, and to contain unfilled sections, including uncompleted signature and identification verification sections. The citizenship judge observed that someone else could well have purchased the vehicle in Canada on Ms. Huang's behalf.",
    "[63]\nIn my view, it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to conclude that the foregoing documentation did not establish that Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period, particularly given the previously mentioned inconsistencies in her evidence and the citizenship judge's observations that (i) Ms. Huang did not provide any leases or rental agreements for any accommodation or residence during the Disputed Period, and (ii) a letter from her doctor states that there were no visits between March 26, 2005 and June 20, 2006, when she returned, three months into her pregnancy with her third child.",
    "[64]\nMs. Huang asserts that she provided other documentation evidencing her presence in Canada during the Disputed Period, including (i) an invoice from BC Hydro evidencing a \"transfer\" payment in the amount of $3.41; (ii) an invoice from Shaw Cable; and (iii) statements from the Bank of Montreal. However, as with the other documentation discussed above, this documentation does not demonstrate on its face that Ms. Huang was present in Canada during the Disputed Period, and it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to fail to explicitly address this documentation. Indeed, the invoice from BC Hydro reflects a very low electricity usage charge of only $3.75 for the period May 16, 2006 to June 13, 2006; the invoice from Shaw Cable does not evidence any previous charges or outstanding balance; and the transactions identified in the Bank of Montreal statement consist of transfers, online transfers, pre-authorized payments, cheques, incoming wire payments, debit memos and error corrections. None of this persuasively demonstrates that Ms. Huang was physically present in Canada. This was all activity that may well have been conducted from abroad (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[65]\nI acknowledge that the citizenship judge may have erred when she observed that certain credit card transactions reflecting activity in Canada in July 2007 were inconsistent with a statement allegedly made by Ms. Huang that she was in China at that time. However, this error is not material, as it did not relate to the Disputed Period, and Ms. Huang appears to have been given credit for being in Canada at that time. Likewise, I do not consider the citizenship judge's apparent error regarding a credit card transaction that she believed reflected a transaction in China on May 28, 2006 to be material, because it does not appear to have played a material role in the conclusion that Ms. Huang had not established on a balance of probabilities that she was physically present during the Disputed Period.",
    "[66]\nTuring to the fifth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang's absences from Canada were not due to any temporary situation, but rather involved returns to China to be with her husband and to spend time with her immediate and extended family. Ms. Huang did not contest this finding.",
    "[67]\nFinally, with respect to the sixth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded it was \"evident that [Ms. Huang's] ties to China, the place where she was born, raised, educated, married, where her entire family resides, and where she has returned to live, are significantly stronger than her ties to Canada.\" Once again, Ms. Huang did not contest this finding.",
    "[68]\nBased on all of the foregoing, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang did not satisfy the\nKoo\ntest for citizenship.",

The Court has noted this on several occasions\n(\nsee, for example,\nHarry (Re)\n[1998] FCJ No 189, at paras 15-26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nHao\n]; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Another potential approach would be for a citizenship judge to bring a reference to the Court under subsection 18.3(1) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, RSC 1985, c F-7 [\nFC Act\n]. Among other things, this would provide an opportunity for the issue to then be brought before the Federal Court of Appeal, pursuant to paragraph 27(1)(d) of the\nFC Act\n, to finally settle the divergence in this Court's jurisprudence that has persisted now for several decades.\n1.\nOverview\n[3]\nThe Applicant, Ms. Huang, is appealing an adverse determination by a citizenship judge of her application for citizenship.\n[4]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge erred by:\ni. breaching the principles of procedural fairness in handling her case;\nii. failing to properly assess her residence in Canada; and\niii. failing to properly assess her proficiency in English.\n[5]\nI disagree. For the reasons that follow, this appeal is dismissed.\n2.\nBackground Facts\n[6]\nMs. Huang is a citizen of China. She arrived in Canada on February 26, 2005, on an investor class visa.\n[7]\nAfter several trips back and forth between Canada and China, including two in which she gave birth to a child here, she applied for Canadian citizenship on August 6, 2009.\n[8]\nAccordingly, the relevant period [Relevant Period] for the purposes of calculating her residence was from August 6, 2005 to August 6, 2009.\n3.\nRelevant legislation\n[9]\nSubsection 5(1) of the\nCitizenship Act\nsets forth a conjunctive test for citizenship. That provision states:\nThe Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n(a) makes application for citizenship;\n(b) is eighteen years of age or over;\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and\n(f) is not under a removal order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20.\n[10]\nPursuant to subsection 14(6), and subject to section 20 (which is not relevant to this case), no appeal lies from a decision of this Court on an appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge.\n4.\nStandard of Review\n[11]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to procedural fairness is reviewable on a standard of correctness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 55 and 79 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 43).\n[12]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to the citizenship judge's assessment of Ms. Huang's residence in Canada has two prongs. Generally speaking, the first prong concerns the legal test for citizenship, namely, whether it was open to the citizenship judge to apply a particular test. That is a question of law which concerns the interpretation of section 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nand this Court's jurisprudence.\n[13]\nIn interpreting the\nCitizenship Act\n, a citizenship judge is interpreting either his or her \"home statute\" or a statute closely connected with the judge's function, and with which he or she can be presumed to have particular familiarity. The Supreme Court of Canada's jurisprudence teaches that, absent exceptional circumstances, determinations reached by administrative tribunals in this context should be presumed to be reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 34 [\nAlberta Teachers\n]).\n[14]\nOne such exceptional circumstance is where the question of law is \"of central importance to the legal system as a whole and ... outside the adjudicator's expertise\" (\nAlberta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 30, 34 and 43).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nMartinez\n], Justice Rennie concluded, in\nobiter\n, that the interpretation of section 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nis such a question. While I am very sympathetic to his reasoning, I am reluctant to embrace it because the Supreme Court subsequently noted that it had yet to encounter the type of exceptional situation involving statutory interpretation that would merit review on a standard of correctness\n(Alberta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 34; see also\nHao\n, above, at para 39).\n[15]\nAs noted above, the issue of the legal test for citizenship concerns not only the interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act,\nbut also the interpretation of this Court's extensive jurisprudence on this issue.\n[16]\nThe specific question of law that has been raised by Ms. Huang is whether the Citizenship judge was entitled to apply the test articulated by this Court in\nKoo (Re)\n[1993] 1 FC 286, at para 10 [\nKoo\n].\n[17]\nAs discussed in part 5.B of these reasons below, the test set forth in\nKoo\n, above, is one of three tests for citizenship that have long been established in this Court's jurisprudence. It is a qualitative test that is similar to one of the other tests, and is very different from the third test (the \"physical presence\" test), which is quantitative in nature.\n[18]\nThese three tests continue to be embraced by this Court. The ongoing existence of this divergence of views within the Court reflects a very peculiar state of the law that developed and has persisted in part due to the fact that, pursuant to subsection 14(6) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, no appeal lies from a decision of this Court on an appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge.\n[19]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLam\n], Justice Lutfy, as he then was, took note of this \"conflicting jurisprudence,\" which essentially pertains to the proper interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n. He observed, at paragraph 11, that \"[t]he divergence of views, both in this Court and among citizenship judges, has brought uncertainty to the administration of justice in these matters.\" However, given that legislation which would have clarified the citizenship test was then pending, he concluded that, during the period of transition, deference should be accorded to a citizenship judge's choice of which of the three tests to apply, provided that he or she demonstrates an understanding of the case law and properly decides that the facts meet the test that has been applied (\nLam\n, above, at para 33).\n[20]\nA decade later, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], at paragraph 44, Justice Mainville observed that over the course of the intervening period the approach adopted by Justice Lutfy had been largely followed. However, after noting that the decision in\nLam\nhad been \"rendered in a situation that was perceived to be temporary given the statutory amendments that were under consideration at that time,\" he concluded that the time had come to settle upon a single interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) if the\nCitizenship Act\n. To this end, and after observing that the test set forth in\nKoo\nhad become the dominant test in this Court's jurisprudence, he concluded that this test should henceforth be the sole test to be applied under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n). He reached that conclusion notwithstanding his view that the \"physical presence test,\" discussed below, appears to have been contemplated by the clear wording of that provision.\n[21]\nAs it has turned out, Justice Mainville's laudable \"attempt to standardize the applicable law\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47), has not been successful. In short, while his view that the\nKoo\ntest should be the sole standard has been endorsed in several subsequent decisions of this Court (see for example, the cases listed in\nHao\n, above, at para 42, and in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Khader\n]; see also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 32), a citizenship judge's discretion to apply one of the other recognized tests has been upheld in several other decisions (see, for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nHao\n, above, at paras 48-50;\nEl  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 23;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSaad\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n[22]\nIndeed, this Court has held in a number of other decisions that the \"physical presence\" test, discussed below, is the correct test to apply (\nMartinez\n, above, at para 52;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[23]\nIn other decisions, the Court appears to have adopted a hybrid approach, which would require a citizenship judge to proceed to conduct a qualitative assessment, as contemplated by the\nKoo\ntest, even if the \"physical presence\" test has been selected by the citizenship judge and failed by the applicant (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[24]\nWhat is clear from the foregoing is that the jurisprudence pertaining to the test(s) for citizenship remains divided and somewhat unsettled.\n[25]\nIn this context, it is particularly appropriate that deference be accorded to a citizenship judge's decision to apply any of the three tests that have a long and rich heritage in this Court's jurisprudence.\n[26]\nThis conclusion is consistent with the dominant view in this Court that the standard to be applied in reviewing a citizenship judge's decision reasonableness (\nSaad\n, above, at para 9;\nHao\n, above, at para 13; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 8; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13).\n[27]\nThe second prong of the issue that has been raised regarding the citizenship judge's assessment of Ms. Huang's application for citizenship concerns the application of the legal test for citizenship to the facts of this case. That is a question of mixed fact and law that is also reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.\n[28]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to whether the Citizenship judge erred by failing to properly assess her proficiency in English is also a question of mixed fact and law that is subject to review on a standard of reasonableness.\n5.\nAnalysis\nA.\nDid the citizenship judge breach the principles of procedural fairness in handling Ms. Huang's case?\n[29]\nMs. Huang submits that her procedural fairness rights were breached because she was not given adequate notice of her interview with the Citizenship judge, and because the interview notice did not advise her of the purpose of the interview. I disagree.\n[30]\nIn a letter dated October 25, 2010, Ms. Huang was advised that the citizenship judge required further information and that further processing of her application could not continue until she supplied that information.\n[31]\nThen, on February 21, 2011, Ms. Huang was advised by way of a form letter that the information she had supplied had been reviewed and that the citizenship judge requested a hearing to finalize the processing of her application. That letter also advised that her appointment with the Citizenship judge was \"for residency assessment.\"\n[32]\nOn April 4, 2011, Ms. Huang received a Notice to Appear from the Citizenship Office in Vancouver, requesting her to appear for an interview the following day. Among other things, that notice stated that she would \"be asked questions to determine if [she had] an adequate knowledge of English or French and an adequate knowledge of Canada.\" In addition, the notice stated: \"If you do not attend this hearing, at the above date, time and place, you will receive a second and final notice.\"\n[33]\nIn my view, the Notice to Appear sent on April 4, 2011 must be viewed together with the form letter that was sent on February 21, 2011. When those two written communications are viewed together, it is clear that Ms. Huang was given more than adequate notice to appear for her interview. She was also clearly informed that residency and language issues would be addressed during that interview. With this in mind, and given that she was informed that she would be given another opportunity to appear if she did not appear for her scheduled interview on April 5, 2011, her procedural fairness rights were not breached by virtue of the amount of notice she was given or the topics that were covered in the interview.\n[34]\nMy conclusion in this regard is reinforced by the fact that, following her interview, Ms. Huang was provided an opportunity to supply further information. In addition, she does not appear to have objected, at the time of her interview, to the short notice that had been given in the Notice to Appear, and she was accompanied by an interpreter.\n[35]\nMs. Huang also asserts that the citizenship judge did not conduct herself in an objective and independent manner. This allegation appears to rest on the fact that the citizenship judge re-tested Ms. Huang's knowledge of English and knowledge of Canada during the interview, notwithstanding that she had passed a prior written test. Given the nature of the written notices, summarized above, that she received, I am satisfied that the citizenship judge's decision to re-test Ms. Huang on these matters during the interview did not breach her procedural fairness rights.\nB.\nDid the Citizenship judge fail to properly assess Ms. Huang's residence in Canada?\ni.\nThe test for citizenship that was applied\n[36]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge erred by applying the test articulated in\nKoo\n, above, rather than the \"physical presence\" test. I disagree.\n[37]\nAs noted above, the jurisprudence of this Court has established three tests for citizenship. These are generally known as the \"centralized mode of living\" test, the\nKoo\ntest (which focuses upon where the applicant \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\") and the \"physical presence\" test.\n[38]\nIt is now well established that before any of these tests can be applied, an applicant for citizenship must establish that he or she is physically resident in Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 50;\nMartinez\n, above, at para 9;\nHao\n, above, at para 24; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13).\n[39]\nThe \"centralized mode of living test\" was articulated by Associate Chief Justice Thurlow, as he then was, in\nPapadogiorgakis (Re)\n, [1978] 2 FC 208, at paras 16-17 [\nPapadogiorgakis\n]. This test is a qualitative test that focuses upon \"the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question,\" even though the person may have lengthy absences from Canada.\n[40]\nThe \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" test was established by Justice Reed, in\nKoo\n, above, at para 10, who identified six factors to guide the assessment of whether this test has been met in any given case. Those factors will be discussed in the next section of these reasons below.\n[41]\nThe \"physical presence\" test is commonly attributed to Justice Muldoon, who stated in\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] FCJ No 232, at paras 3-9 [\nPourghasemi\n], that paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\nrequires, among other things, that an applicant for citizenship be physically present for a minimum of three years (1,095 days) in the four year period immediately preceding his application.\n[42]\nIn\nLam\n, above, Justice Lutfy, as he then was, held that \"it is open to the citizenship judge to adopt either one of the conflicting schools in this Court and, if the facts of the case were properly applied to the principles of the chose approach, the decision of the citizenship judge would not be wrong\" (\nLam\n, above, at para 14).\n[43]\nAs it turned out, the proposed legislation discussed in\nLam\nwas not enacted. Nevertheless, in my view, a reasonable interpretation of this Court's jurisprudence is that the law as articulated by Justice Lutfy has not changed with respect to a citizenship judge's ability to apply any one of the three tests for citizenship described above (see the second line of cases referred to at paragraph 21 above). I have reached this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that I personally find the reasoning in\nMartinez\n, above, and its progeny to be compelling. As noted at paragraph 22 above, that line of jurisprudence holds that the physical presence test is the correct test to apply, and is indeed the only one contemplated by paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.\n[44]\nHowever, with respect to those who hold a contrary view, I do not believe that this Court's jurisprudence, on balance, supports an approach that would effectively\nrequire\na blending of two or more of the three aforementioned tests (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 31). For example, if a citizenship judge decides to apply the physical presence test and concludes that the applicant in question did not meet that test, it would be inconsistent with a fair reading of the main branches of this Court's jurisprudence (namely, the approaches set forth in\nPapadogiorgakis, Pourghasemi, Koo\nand\nLam,\nrespectively, and in their respective progenies) for the citizenship judge to be\nrequired\nto then apply the\nKoo\ntest or the \"centralized mode of living test.\" This would effectively require the citizenship judge to give the applicant \"two kicks at the can.\" In the present state of the Court's jurisprudence, it would be reasonably open to the citizenship judge to terminate the assessment under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\nupon concluding that the physical presence test had not been met by the applicant.\n[45]\nIn this case, that is not what happened. The citizenship judge appears to have decided to not apply the physical presence test, after concluding that she was not satisfied that the information provided by Ms. Huang accurately reflected the number of days that she was, in fact, physically present in Canada. She therefore decided to apply the\nKoo\ntest. Under the longstanding jurisprudence of this Court, she was at liberty to do so. Stated differently, it was reasonably open for her to do so. This was well \"within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). This aspect of the decision under review was also reasonably justified, transparent and intelligible.\n[46]\nMs. Huang also takes issue with the citizenship judge's use of the words \"in fact,\" and asserts that this imposed a higher threshold than a \"balance of probabilities.\" I disagree.\n[47]\nThe citizenship judge explicitly stated that she was \"not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities\" that the information supplied by Ms. Huang accurately reflected the number of days that she was, in fact, physically present in Canada. Based on my reading of the decision as a whole, I am satisfied that she did not apply a standard different from the balance of probabilities standard she stated she had applied.\ni.\nThe Citizenship judge's application of the Koo test to the facts in the record\n[48]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge misapprehended several aspects of the evidentiary record and, that as a result of those errors, the conclusion that she had not satisfied the test for citizenship was unreasonable. I disagree.\n[49]\nIn\nKoo\n, above, Justice Reed identified the following six questions to be addressed in determining whether an applicant for citizenship \"regularly, normally or customarily\" lives in Canada:\ni. Was the individual physically present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences which occurred immediately before the application for citizenship?\nii. Where are the applicant's immediate family and dependents (and extended family) resident?\niii. Does the pattern of physical presence in Canada indicate a returning home or merely visiting the country?\niv. What is the extent of the physical absences - if an applicant is only a few days short of the 1,095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence than if those absences are extensive?\nv. Is the physical absence caused by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, accompanying a spouse who has accepted employment abroad?\nvi. What is the quality of the connection with Canada: is it more substantial than that which exists with any other country?\n[50]\nWith respect to the first factor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang had only been in Canada for a total of 99 days prior to the Relevant Period, and that this did not constitute a \"long period\" as contemplated by\nKoo\n, above. Ms. Huang did not take issue with this finding.\n[51]\nWith respect to the second factor, the citizenship judge concluded that the applicant lives with her husband, daughter and two sons in China, where her parents, her two sisters and her extended family also live. The citizenship judge also noted that Ms. Huang has no relatives living in Canada. Ms. Huang did not take issue with this finding.\n[52]\nTurning to the third factor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang's travel history between China and Canada reflects that her home is in China, and that she simply visited Canada for the purpose of giving birth to two of her children here, and to give her eldest and middle children the opportunity to attend school and preschool here. In my view, this conclusion is entirely consistent with the facts in the record.\n[53]\nIn reaching that conclusion, the citizenship judge identified a number of inconsistencies in the materials that had been submitted by Ms. Huang in support of her application. For example, in her Residence Questionnaire, she indicated that she resided in Canada with her husband from February 2005 until November 21, 2010, and that, from May 2006 to the end of that period she lived at a particular address in Richmond, British Columbia from May 2006. However, during the hearing, she acknowledged that her husband returned to live in China in 2005, that he only returned for a few months each year to live with her and that she returned to live with him on August 21, 2009.\n[54]\nIn the course of reaching her conclusion with respect to this third\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge also questioned some of the documentation that Ms. Huang had provided to support her position that she was present in Canada between April 8, 2006 and June 6, 2006. Ms. Huang asserts that this aspect of the citizenship judge's analysis was unreasonable. I will deal with Ms. Huang's submissions in this regard below, as this aspect of the citizenship judge's analysis overlaps with her assessment of the fourth\nKoo\nfactor.\n[55]\nIn assessing the fourth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang fell 54 days short of the 1,095 days specified in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. She reached this conclusion after stating that she had not been convinced that Ms. Huang had been present in Canada for the 59 day period between April 8, 2006 and June 7, 2006 [Disputed Period].\n[56]\nAs noted above, Ms. Huang asserts that this finding was not reasonable. In particular, Ms. Huang states that, based on the fact that her passport was stamped with an exit stamp from China on April 8, 2006 and did not contain entry stamps or visas from other countries during that period immediately following that date, the only reasonable conclusion available to the citizenship judge was that she entered Canada on that date and remained there until her next declared trip. I disagree.\n[57]\nMs. Huang's passport reflects a very active travel history, including to Australia, Malaysia, and the United States. Among her declared absences from Canada during the Relevant Period, four were to the United States (Certified Tribunal Record, at p 128). Particularly in this context, it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to fail to infer that Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period, simply because she was not in China. The burden was on Ms. Huang's to establish on a balance of probabilities the number of days that she was in Canada. Contrary to Ms. Huang's position, the exit stamp from China in her passport is not \"reliable proof as far as her travel in and out of Canada is concerned.\"\n[58]\nMs. Huang also takes issue with the citizenship judge's statement that \"[t]here is no supporting evidence or documentation to show that the applicant was resident in Canada between August 6, 2005 and June 7, 2006.\"\n[59]\nAfter making that statement, the citizenship judge acknowledged that Ms. Huang came to Canada for 49 days between October 22, 2005 and December 10, 2005. Ms. Huang therefore only takes issue with respect to the period April 8, 2006 and June 7, 2006.\n[60]\nBased on my reading of this part of the citizenship judge's decision as a whole, I am satisfied that what the citizenship judge meant is that there was no supporting evidence or documentation to\npersuasively establish\nthat Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period. The citizenship judge appropriately discussed the principal documentation that Ms. Huang relies upon to establish her presence in Canada during that period. However, the citizenship judge reasonably concluded that it did not establish such presence.\n[61]\nThe documentation in question included information with respect to credit card activity that reflected transactions to purchase a car and car insurance on April 16, 2006 and April 30, 2006. That information did not reflect any other transactions in Canada until June 7, 2006, whereas other information that had been provided reflected significant activity in Canada on Ms. Huang's MasterCard during the aforementioned 49 day period that she was in Canada in late 2005.\n[62]\nOther documentation included a car purchase document that the citizenship judge found to be very faded, difficult to read, and to contain unfilled sections, including uncompleted signature and identification verification sections. The citizenship judge observed that someone else could well have purchased the vehicle in Canada on Ms. Huang's behalf.\n[63]\nIn my view, it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to conclude that the foregoing documentation did not establish that Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period, particularly given the previously mentioned inconsistencies in her evidence and the citizenship judge's observations that (i) Ms. Huang did not provide any leases or rental agreements for any accommodation or residence during the Disputed Period, and (ii) a letter from her doctor states that there were no visits between March 26, 2005 and June 20, 2006, when she returned, three months into her pregnancy with her third child.\n[64]\nMs. Huang asserts that she provided other documentation evidencing her presence in Canada during the Disputed Period, including (i) an invoice from BC Hydro evidencing a \"transfer\" payment in the amount of $3.41; (ii) an invoice from Shaw Cable; and (iii) statements from the Bank of Montreal. However, as with the other documentation discussed above, this documentation does not demonstrate on its face that Ms. Huang was present in Canada during the Disputed Period, and it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to fail to explicitly address this documentation. Indeed, the invoice from BC Hydro reflects a very low electricity usage charge of only $3.75 for the period May 16, 2006 to June 13, 2006; the invoice from Shaw Cable does not evidence any previous charges or outstanding balance; and the transactions identified in the Bank of Montreal statement consist of transfers, online transfers, pre-authorized payments, cheques, incoming wire payments, debit memos and error corrections. None of this persuasively demonstrates that Ms. Huang was physically present in Canada. This was all activity that may well have been conducted from abroad (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[65]\nI acknowledge that the citizenship judge may have erred when she observed that certain credit card transactions reflecting activity in Canada in July 2007 were inconsistent with a statement allegedly made by Ms. Huang that she was in China at that time. However, this error is not material, as it did not relate to the Disputed Period, and Ms. Huang appears to have been given credit for being in Canada at that time. Likewise, I do not consider the citizenship judge's apparent error regarding a credit card transaction that she believed reflected a transaction in China on May 28, 2006 to be material, because it does not appear to have played a material role in the conclusion that Ms. Huang had not established on a balance of probabilities that she was physically present during the Disputed Period.\n[66]\nTuring to the fifth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang's absences from Canada were not due to any temporary situation, but rather involved returns to China to be with her husband and to spend time with her immediate and extended family. Ms. Huang did not contest this finding.\n[67]\nFinally, with respect to the sixth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded it was \"evident that [Ms. Huang's] ties to China, the place where she was born, raised, educated, married, where her entire family resides, and where she has returned to live, are significantly stronger than her ties to Canada.\" Once again, Ms. Huang did not contest this finding.\n[68]\nBased on all of the foregoing, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang did not satisfy the\nKoo\ntest for citizenship.\n[69]\nIn my view, that conclusion was well \"within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). It was also reasonably justified, transparent and intelligible.\nC.\nDid the Citizenship judge fail to properly assess Ms. Huang's proficiency in English?\n[70]\nGiven my responses to the first two of the three principle issues raised in this application, and given that the test for citizenship set forth in subsection 5(1) of the\nCitizenship Act\nis conjunctive, it is unnecessary for me to address this third issue.\nConclusion\n[71]\nFor the reasons set forth above, this appeal is dismissed.\n[72]\nThe Respondent has sought its costs in this proceeding. However, I am not satisfied that facts in this case are sufficiently exceptional to warrant the exercise of my discretion to grant this request (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nJUDGMENT\n[73]\nTHIS COURT DECLARES, ADJUDGES AND ORDERS that:\nthis appeal is dismissed.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Crampton\n[Traduction]: La présente affaire n'est qu'un autre exemple qui illustre l'urgence de faire quelque chose pour régler la situation inacceptable actuelle concernant le critère qui est présentement appliqué au Canada en matière d'attribution de la citoyenneté.\n[2]\nLa solution idéale consisterait pour le législateur fédéral à intervenir en définissant un critère de citoyenneté plus clair dans la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, LRC 1985, c C-29. C'est la solution que notre Cour a préconisée à plusieurs reprises (voir, par exemple, l'affaire\nHarry (Re)\n[1998] ACF no 189, aux paragraphes 15 à 26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nHao\n]; et\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Une autre approche pourrait consister pour un juge de la citoyenneté à renvoyer la question à la Cour conformément au paragraphe 18.3(1) de la\nLoi sur les Cours fédérales\n, LRC 1985, c F-7 [la Loi sur les CF]. Cette façon de procéder permettrait notamment de renvoyer ensuite la question à la Cour d'appel fédérale en vertu de l'alinéa 27(1)\nd\n) de la Loi sur les CF pour régler une fois pour toutes la divergence qui existe dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour depuis plusieurs décennies à ce sujet.\n1.\nVue d'ensemble\n[3]\nLa demanderesse, Mme Huang, interjette appel de la décision défavorable qu'une juge de la citoyenneté a rendue en réponse à sa demande de citoyenneté.\n[4]\nMadame Huang affirme que la juge de la citoyenneté a commis les erreurs suivantes:\ni. elle a manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale dans la façon dont elle a traité son dossier;\nii. elle n'a pas apprécié correctement la preuve sur l'obligation de résidence au Canada;\niii. elle n'a pas apprécié correctement ses compétences linguistiques en anglais.\n[5]\nJe ne suis pas du même avis que la demanderesse. Pour les motifs qui suivent, le présent appel est rejeté.\n2.\nFaits à l'origine du litige\n[6]\nMadameme Huang est une citoyenne de la Chine. Elle est arrivée au Canada le 26 février 2005 munie d'un visa délivré dans la catégorie des investisseurs.\n[7]\nAprès avoir fait la navette plusieurs fois entre le Canada et la Chine, et notamment après être venue deux fois au Canada pour accoucher, la demanderesse a demandé la citoyenneté canadienne le 6 août 2009.\n[8]\nPar conséquent, la période applicable pour calculer sa résidence est celle comprise entre le 6 août 2005 et le 6 août 2009.\n3.\nDispositions législatives applicables\n[9]\nLe paragraphe 5(1) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\nénonce un critère cumulatif en matière de citoyenneté. Il dispose:\nLe ministre attribue la citoyenneté à toute personne qui, à la fois:\na) en fait la demande;\nb) est âgée d'au moins dix-huit ans;\nc) est un résident permanent au sens du paragraphe 2(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés et a, dans les quatre ans qui ont précédé la date de sa demande, résidé au Canada pendant au moins trois ans en tout, la durée de sa résidence étant calculée de la manière suivante:\n(i) un demi-jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada avant son admission à titre de résident permanent,\n(ii) un jour pour chaque jour de résidence au Canada après son admission à titre de résident permanent;\nd) a une connaissance suffisante de l'une des langues officielles du Canada;\ne) a une connaissance suffisante du Canada et des responsabilités et avantages conférés par la citoyenneté;\nf) n'est pas sous le coup d'une mesure de renvoi et n'est pas visée par une déclaration du gouverneur en conseil faite en application de l'article 20.\n[10]\nAux termes du paragraphe 14(6) et sous réserve de l'article 20 - lequel ne s'applique pas dans le cas qui nous occupe - la décision de la Cour rendue sur l'appel d'une décision d'un juge de la citoyenneté est définitive et non susceptible d'appel.\n4.\nNorme de contrôle applicable\n[11]\nLa question soulevée en l'espèce au sujet de l'équité procédurale est assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la décision correcte (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , aux paragraphes 55 et 79 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 43).\n[12]\nLa question soulevée relativement à l'appréciation que la juge de la citoyenneté a faite de la période de résidence de Mme Huang au Canada comporte deux volets. En règle générale, le premier volet porte sur le critère légal de la citoyenneté, en l'occurrence la question de savoir s'il était loisible au juge de la citoyenneté d'appliquer un critère déterminé. Il s'agit d'une question de droit qui porte sur l'interprétation de l'article 5 de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\net sur la jurisprudence de notre Cour.\n[13]\nLorsqu'il interprète la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, le juge de la citoyenneté interprète  sa propre loi constitutive  ou une loi étroitement liée à son mandat et dont il est présumé avoir une connaissance approfondie. La jurisprudence de la Cour suprême du Canada nous enseigne que, sauf situation exceptionnelle, il convient de présumer que les conclusions tirées en pareil cas par un tribunal administratif commandent la déférence et sont assujetties à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable (\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 34 [\nAlberta Teachers\n]).\n[14]\nUne des circonstances exceptionnelles en question se présente lorsque la question de droit  revêt une importance capitale pour le système juridique dans son ensemble [...] ou est étrangère au domaine d'expertise du décideur  (\nAlberta Teachers\n, précité, aux paragraphes 30, 34 et 43). Dans le jugement\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nMartinez\n], le juge Rennie a fait observer à titre incident, que l'interprétation de l'article 5 de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\ncorrespondait à ce type de question. Bien que ce raisonnement paraisse séduisant à première vue, j'hésite à m'y rallier parce que la Cour suprême a par la suite fait observer qu'elle n'avait pas encore rencontré le type de situation exceptionnelle faisant appel à une interprétation législative qui justifierait un contrôle judiciaire selon la norme de la décision correcte (\nAlberta Teachers\n, précitée, au paragraphe 34; voir également le jugement\nHao\n, précité, au paragraphe 39).\n[15]\nComme nous l'avons déjà fait observer, la question du critère légal de la citoyenneté concerne non seulement l'interprétation de l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, mais aussi celle de l'abondante jurisprudence de notre Cour sur la question.\n[16]\nLa question de droit précise soulevée par Mme Huang est celle de savoir si la juge de la citoyenneté avait le droit d'appliquer le critère énoncé par notre Cour dans le jugement\nKoo\n, [1993] 1 CF 286, au paragraphe 10 [\nKoo\n].\n[17]\nComme nous le verrons plus loin à la partie 5.B des présents motifs, le critère énoncé dans le jugement\nKoo\n, précité, est l'un des trois critères de la citoyenneté établis depuis longtemps dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour. Il s'agit d'un critère qualitatif, qui ressemble à l'un des autres critères et qui est très différent du troisième critère, celui de la  présence effective , lequel est de nature quantitative.\n[18]\nNotre Cour adhère toujours à ces trois critères. La divergence de vues qui continue à exister au sein de notre Cour s'explique par une situation très particulière qui s'est développée et qui persiste dans notre droit en partie en raison du fait qu'aux termes du paragraphe 14(6) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n, la décision que notre Cour rend sur l'appel d'une décision d'un juge de la citoyenneté est définitive et non susceptible d'appel.\n[19]\nDans le jugement\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 32 [\nLam\n], le juge Lutfy, devenu par la suite juge en chef adjoint de Cour d'appel fédérale, a pris acte de cette  jurisprudence contradictoire  qui portait essentiellement sur l'interprétation juste de l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n. Il a fait observer, au paragraphe 11,  [c] ette divergence de vues, tant au sein de la Cour que parmi les juges de la citoyenneté, est cause d'incertitude dans l'administration de la justice dans ce domaine . Toutefois, compte tenu du fait que des mesures législatives qui auraient clarifié le critère de la citoyenneté étaient alors à l'étude, il a conclu que, pendant la période de transition, il convenait de faire preuve de déférence et de respecter le choix que les juges de la citoyenneté feraient du critère parmi les trois critères à appliquer, à condition que la décision du juge dénote une compréhension de la jurisprudence et qu'il ait décidé à bon droit que les faits satisfont sa conception du critère retenu (\nLam\n, précité, au paragraphe 33).\n[20]\nUne décennie plus tard, dans le jugement\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], au paragraphe 44, le juge Mainville a fait observer que, dans l'intervalle, la démarche proposée par la juge Lutfy avait été largement suivie. Toutefois, après avoir observé que cette décision avait été  rendue dans le cadre d'une situation qui était perçue comme transitoire vu les modifications législatives qui étaient alors à l'étude , il a conclu que le temps était venu de fixer une interprétation unique de l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté.\nÀ cette fin, et après avoir fait observer que le critère énoncé dans le jugement\nKoo\nétait devenu le critère le plus souvent appliqué dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour, il a conclu que c'était dorénavant le seul critère qui devait être appliqué pour l'interprétation de l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n). Il en est arrivé à cette conclusion malgré le fait qu'il estimait que le  critère de la présence effective , sur lequel nous reviendrons plus loin, semblait avoir été celui qu'envisageait le libellé clair de cette disposition.\n[21]\nL' effort d'uniformisation du droit applicable  entreprise par le juge Mainville, bien que louable, n'a pas produit les résultats escomptés ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , au paragraphe 47). En résumé, bien que dans plusieurs décisions subséquentes, notre Cour ait adopté l'opinion du juge Mainville suivant laquelle le critère du jugement\nKoo\ndevait être la seule norme applicable (voir, par exemple, les décisions énumérées dans le jugement\nHao\n, précité, au paragraphe 42, et dans le jugement\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Khader\n]; voir également <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 32), le pouvoir discrétionnaire qui permet au juge de la citoyenneté d'appliquer l'un des autres critères reconnus a été confirmé dans plusieurs autres décisions (voir, par exemple,\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 9;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 37 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nHao\n, précité, aux paragraphes 48 à 50;\nEl Khader\n, précité, au paragraphe 23;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSaad\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n[22]\nD'ailleurs, notre Cour a jugé dans plusieurs autres décisions que le critère de la  présence effective  que nous analyserons plus loin, est le bon critère à appliquer (\nMartinez\n, précité, au paragraphe 52;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[23]\nDans d'autres décisions, il semble que la Cour ait retenu une approche hybride qui obligerait le juge de la citoyenneté à se livrer à une appréciation qualitative comme le prévoit le critère du jugement\nKoo\n, et ce, même si le critère de la  présence effective  a été retenu par le juge de la citoyenneté et a entraîné le rejet de la demande de citoyenneté (\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[24]\nIl ressort de ce qui précède que la jurisprudence relative au(x) critère(s) de la citoyenneté demeure partagée et plutôt flottante.\n[25]\nDans ces conditions, il convient tout particulièrement de faire preuve de déférence envers la décision du juge de la citoyenneté d'appliquer l'un ou l'autre des trois critères qui sont reconnus depuis si longtemps dans la jurisprudence de notre Cour.\n[26]\nCette conclusion s'accorde avec l'opinion dominante au sein de notre Cour suivant laquelle la norme à appliquer lorsqu'il s'agit de contrôler la décision d'un juge de la citoyenneté est celle de la décision raisonnable (\nSaad\n, précité, au paragraphe 9;\nHao\n, précité, au paragraphe 13; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 8; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 13).\n[27]\nLe second volet de la question qui a été soulevée au sujet de l'appréciation que la juge de la citoyenneté a faite de la demande de citoyenneté de Mme Huang concerne l'application du critère légal de la citoyenneté aux faits de la présente affaire. Il s'agit d'une question mixte de fait et de droit qui est également assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable.\n[28]\nLa question en litige soulevée, soit celle de savoir si la juge de la citoyenneté a commis une erreur en n'évaluant pas correctement les compétences linguistiques de la demanderesse en anglais, est également une question mixte de fait et de droit qui est assujettie à la norme de contrôle de la décision raisonnable.\n5.\nAnalyse\nA.\nLa juge de la citoyenneté a-t-elle manqué aux principes d'équité procédurale dans la façon dont elle a traité le dossier de Mme Huang?\n[29]\nMadame Huang affirme que ses droits à l'équité procédurale ont été violés parce qu'elle n'a pas reçu un avis suffisant avant son entrevue avec la juge de la citoyenneté et parce que l'avis d'entrevue ne l'informait pas de l'objet de celle-ci. Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[30]\nDans une lettre datée du 25 octobre 2010, Mme Huang était avisée que la juge de la citoyenneté avait besoin de renseignements complémentaires et que l'examen de sa demande ne pouvait être poursuivi tant qu'elle ne fournirait pas les renseignements en question.\n[31]\nPuis, le 21 février 2011, Mme Huang a été informée par voie de lettre type, que les renseignements qu'elle avait fournis avaient été examinés et que la juge de la citoyenneté réclamait la tenue d'une audience pour poursuivre l'examen de sa demande. La lettre informait également que la rencontre avec la juge de la citoyenneté avait pour objet [traduction]  d'évaluer la résidence .\n[32]\nLe 4 avril 2011, Mme Huang a reçu un avis lui enjoignant de se présenter au Bureau de la citoyenneté de Vancouver pour une entrevue devant avoir lieu le lendemain. Cet avis l'informait qu'on lui poserait [traduction]  notamment des questions pour savoir si [elle possédait] des connaissances suffisantes du français ou de l'anglais et du Canada . L'avis précisait également [traduction]  si vous ne vous présentez pas à cette rencontre aux temps, lieu et date précisés, vous recevrez un second avis final .\n[33]\nÀ mon avis, l'avis de convocation du 4 avril 2011 doit être examiné avec la lettre type envoyée le 21 février 2011. Il résulte du rapprochement de ces deux communications écrites que Mme Wong a reçu un avis plus que suffisant l'informant qu'elle devait se présenter à son entrevue. Elle a également été clairement informée des questions de résidence et des questions linguistiques qui seraient abordées au cours de son entrevue. Compte tenu de ces éléments et du fait qu'elle a été informée qu'elle se verrait accorder une autre possibilité de se présenter si elle ne se présentait pas à l'entrevue prévue pour le 5 avril 2011, ces droits à l'équité procédurale n'ont pas été violés compte tenu des avis qu'elle a reçus et des sujets qui ont été abordés lors de son entrevue.\n[34]\nMa conclusion à cet égard est renforcée par le fait qu'à la suite de son entrevue, Mme Huang a eu l'occasion de fournir d'autres renseignements. De plus, il semble qu'elle ne se soit pas opposée, au moment de son entrevue, au bref délai dans lequel elle avait reçu son avis de convocation. En outre, elle était accompagnée d'un interprète.\n[35]\nMadame Huang affirme également que la juge de la citoyenneté ne s'est pas comportée de façon objective et impartiale. Cette allégation semble reposer sur le fait que la juge de la citoyenneté a vérifié de nouveau les connaissances de l'anglais et du Canada de Mme Huang lors de l'entrevue malgré le fait que ces connaissances avaient déjà été vérifiées par écrit. Compte tenu de la nature des avis écrits que nous avons déjà résumés, avis qu'elle avait reçus, je suis convaincu que la décision de la juge de la citoyenneté de vérifier de nouveau les connaissances de Mme Huang sur ces sujets lors de l'entrevue ne constitue pas une violation des droits à l'équité procédurale de Mme Huang.\nB.\nLa juge de la citoyenneté a-t-elle mal apprécié la période de résidence de Mme Huang au Canada?\ni.\nLe critère de la citoyenneté appliqué\n[36]\nMadame Huang affirme que la juge de la citoyenneté a commis une erreur dans la façon dont elle a appliqué le critère énoncé dans le jugement\nKoo\n, précité, celui de la  présence effective . Je ne partage pas son avis.\n[37]\nComme nous l'avons déjà signalé, la jurisprudence de notre Cour a énoncé trois critères en matière de citoyenneté. C'est ce qu'on appelle, en règle générale, le critère du  mode d'existence centralisé , le critère du jugement\nKoo\n(qui est axé sur la question de savoir où l'intéressé  vit régulièrement, normalement ou habituellement ) et le critère de la  présence effective .\n[38]\nIl est de jurisprudence constante qu'avant que l'un ou l'autre de ces critères puisse être appliqué, la personne qui demande la citoyenneté doit démontrer qu'elle est effectivement présente au Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 50;\nMartinez\n, précité, au paragraphe 9;\nHao\n, précité, au paragraphe 24; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 13).\n[39]\nLe  critère du mode d'existence centralisé  a été énoncé par le juge en chef adjoint Thurlow, devenu par la suite juge en chef, dans le jugement\nPapadogiorgakis (Re)\n, [1978] 2 CF 208, aux paragraphes 16 et 17 [\nPapadogiorgakis\n]. Ce critère est un critère qualitatif qui  dépend essentiellement du point jusqu'auquel une personne s'établit en pensée et en fait, ou conserve ou centralise son mode de vie habituel avec son cortège de relations sociales, d'intérêts et de convenances, au lieu en question , même si cette personne a pu s'absenter du Canada pendant de longues périodes.\n[40]\nLe critère consistant à se demander où l'intéressé  vit régulièrement, normalement et habituellement  a été établi par la juge Reed, dans le jugement\nKoo\n, précité, au paragraphe 10. La juge Reed a énuméré six facteurs pour aider à déterminer si ce critère est respecté dans un cas déterminé. Ces facteurs seront analysés dans la prochaine section des présents motifs.\n[41]\nLe critère de la  présence effective  est souvent attribué au juge Muldoon, qui a expliqué, dans le jugement\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] ACF no 232, aux paragraphes 3 à 9 [\nPourghasemi\n], que l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\nexige notamment que la personne qui demande la citoyenneté soit effectivement présente pendant au moins trois ans (1 095 jours) pendant la période de quatre ans précédant sa demande.\n[42]\nDans le jugement\nLam\n, précité, le juge Lutfy, devenu par la suite juge en chef adjoint de la Cour d'appel fédérale, expliqué que  le juge de la citoyenneté peut adhérer à l'une ou l'autre des écoles contradictoires de la Cour, et, s'il appliquait correctement aux faits de la cause les principes de l'approche qu'il privilégie, sa décision ne serait pas erronée  (\nLam\n, précité, au paragraphe 14).\n[43]\nLa mesure législative proposée dont il a été question dans l'affaire\nLam\nn'a finalement pas été adoptée. Quoi qu'il en soit, à mon avis, on peut raisonnablement interpréter la jurisprudence de notre Cour en tenant pour acquis que l'état du droit tel qu'exposé par le juge Lutfy n'a pas changé en ce qui concerne la capacité des juges de la citoyenneté d'appliquer l'un des trois critères de la citoyenneté susmentionnés (voir la seconde série de décisions mentionnées au paragraphe 21). J'en suis arrivé à cette conclusion bien que je trouve personnellement convaincant le raisonnement suivi dans le jugement\nMartinez\n, précité, et dans sa foulée. Comme je l'ai souligné ci-dessus au paragraphe 22, ce courant jurisprudentiel estime que le critère de la présence effective est le bon critère à appliquer et qu'il est en fait le seul critère prévu à l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\n.\n[44]\nToutefois, pour ceux qui sont d'avis contraire, je ne crois pas, selon la prépondérance de la preuve, que la jurisprudence de notre Cour appuie une démarche qui\nexigerait\neffectivement un mélange d'au moins deux des trois critères susmentionnés (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Shubeilat\n, précité, au paragraphe 31). Par exemple, si un juge de la citoyenneté décide d'appliquer le critère de la présence effective et conclut que le demandeur en question ne satisfait pas à ce critère, il serait contraire à l'interprétation logique des principaux courants jurisprudentiels de notre Cour (en l'occurrence, les approches énoncées dans les jugements\nPapadogiorgakis, Pourghasemi, Koo\net\nLam,\nrespectivement, et les décisions rendues dans leur foulée) qu'un juge de la citoyenneté soit\nobligé\nd'appliquer ensuite le critère du jugement\nKoo\nou encore le  critère du mode de vie centralisé . Agir ainsi obligerait en fait le juge de la citoyenneté de permettre au demandeur de tenter sa chance deux fois. Suivant l'état actuel de la jurisprudence de la Cour, il serait raisonnablement loisible au juge de la citoyenneté de mettre fin à l'analyse prévue à l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\ndès lors qu'il estime que le demandeur ne satisfait pas au critère de la présence effective.\n[45]\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, ce n'est pas ce qui s'est produit. La juge de la citoyenneté semble avoir décidé de ne pas appliquer le critère de la présence effective après avoir estimé qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que les renseignements fournis par Mme Huang correspondaient avec exactitude au nombre de jours où elle avait effectivement été présente au Canada. Elle a par conséquent décidé d'appliquer le critère du jugement\nKoo\n. Suivant la jurisprudence constante de notre Cour, il lui était parfaitement loisible de le faire. Autrement dit, il était raisonnablement loisible à la juge de la citoyenneté d'agir de la sorte. Cette décision appartenait  aux issues possibles acceptables au regard des faits et du droit  (\nDunsmuir,\nprécité, au paragraphe 47). Cet aspect de la décision faisant l'objet du présent contrôle était également raisonnablement justifié, transparent et intelligible.\n[46]\nMadame Huang s'oppose également à l'emploi que la juge de la citoyenneté a fait des mots [traduction]  en fait  et affirme qu'elle l'a ainsi obligée à satisfaire à un critère préliminaire plus exigeant que celui de la  prépondérance de la preuve . Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[47]\nLa juge de la citoyenneté a expressément déclaré qu'elle n'était pas [traduction]  convaincue, suivant la prépondérance de la preuve  que les renseignements fournis par Mme Huang correspondaient avec exactitude au nombre de jours pendant lesquels elle avait été effectivement présente au Canada. Compte tenu de ma lecture de l'ensemble de la décision, je suis convaincu que la juge n'a pas appliqué une norme différente de celle de la prépondérance de la preuve qu'elle affirme avoir appliquée.\ni.\nApplication du critère du jugement\nKoo\naux faits du dossier par la juge de la citoyenneté\n[48]\nMadame Huang affirme que la juge de la citoyenneté s'est méprise sur plusieurs aspects du dossier de la preuve et que, par suite de ces erreurs, la conclusion suivant laquelle elle n'avait pas satisfait aux critères de la citoyenneté était déraisonnable. Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[49]\nDans le jugement\nKoo\n, la juge Reed a énuméré six questions auxquelles on pouvait répondre pour déterminer si le candidat à la citoyenneté vivait  régulièrement, normalement ou habituellement  au Canada:\ni. la personne était-elle physiquement présente au Canada durant une période prolongée avant de s'absenter juste avant la date de sa demande de citoyenneté?\nii. où résident la famille proche et les personnes à charge (et les membres de la famille élargie) du requérant?\niii. la forme de présence physique de la personne dénote-t-elle que cette dernière revient dans son pays ou, alors, qu'elle n'est qu'en visite?\niv. quelle est l'étendue des absences physiques - (lorsqu'il ne manque à un requérant que quelques jours pour atteindre le nombre total de 1 095 jours, il est plus facile de conclure à une résidence réputée que lorsque les absences sont considérables?\nv. l'absence physique est-elle imputable à une situation manifestement temporaire (par exemple avoir quitté le Canada pour travailler comme missionnaire, suivre des études, exécuter un emploi\ntemporaire\nou accompagner son conjoint, qui a accepté un emploi temporaire à l'étranger)?\nvi. quelle est la qualité des attaches du requérant avec le Canada: sont-elles plus importantes que celles qui existent avec un autre pays?\n[50]\nEn ce qui concerne le premier facteur, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que Mme Huang n'avait passé au Canada que 99 jours avant la période applicable, ce qui ne constituait pas une  période prolongée  au sens du jugement\nKoo\n, précité. Madame Huang n'a pas contesté cette conclusion.\n[51]\nEn ce qui concerne le second facteur, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que la demanderesse habitait avec son mari, sa fille, et deux fils en Chine, où ses parents, ses deux surs et les membres de sa famille élargie vivaient également. La juge de la citoyenneté a également fait observer que Mme Huang n'a pas de famille au Canada. Madame Huang ne conteste pas cette conclusion.\n[52]\nEn ce qui concerne le troisième facteur, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que l'historique des voyages effectués par Mme Huang entre le Canada et la Chine démontre que son pays est la Chine et qu'elle était simplement en visite au Canada ou qu'elle est venue au Canada pour donner naissance à deux de ses enfants et pour permettre à ses enfants les plus âgés et aux enfants moins âgés de fréquenter l'école et l'école maternelle au Canada. À mon avis, cette conclusion s'accorde parfaitement avec les faits au dossier.\n[53]\nPour en arriver à cette conclusion, la juge de la citoyenneté a relevé plusieurs contradictions dans les pièces que Mme Huang lui avait soumises à l'appui de sa demande. Par exemple, dans son questionnaire de résidence, Mme Huang avait expliqué qu'elle avait résidé au Canada avec son mari entre février 2005 et le 21 novembre 2010 et que, à compter de mai 2006, jusqu'à la fin de la période en question, elle avait habité à une adresse déterminée à Richmond, en Colombie-Britannique. Toutefois, à l'audience, elle a admis que son mari était retourné vivre en Chine en 2005, qu'il ne revenait au Canada pour vivre avec elle que quelques mois par année et qu'elle était retournée vivre avec lui le 21 août 2009.\n[54]\nPour en arriver à sa conclusion en ce qui concerne ce troisième facteur du jugement\nKoo\n, la juge de la citoyenneté a également remis en question la valeur de certains des documents que Mme Huang lui avait soumis pour appuyer son argument qu'elle avait été présente au Canada entre le 8 avril 2006 et le 6 juin 2006. Madame Huang affirme que cet aspect de l'analyse de la juge de la citoyenneté était déraisonnable. Je reviendrai plus loin sur cet aspect des arguments formulés par Mme Huang, étant donné que ce volet de l'analyse de la juge de la citoyenneté recoupe son évaluation du quatrième facteur du jugement\nKoo\n.\n[55]\nPour apprécier le quatrième facteur du jugement\nKoo\n, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu qu'il manquait à Mme Huang 54 jours pour satisfaire à l'exigence des 1 095 jours prévus à l'alinéa 5(1)\nc\n) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté.\nElle en est arrivée à cette conclusion après avoir déclaré qu'elle n'était pas convaincue que Mme Huang avait été présente au Canada pendant la période de 59 jours comprise entre le 8 avril 2006 et le 7 juin 2006 [la période contestée].\n[56]\nComme nous l'avons déjà fait observer, Mme Huang affirme que cette conclusion n'est pas raisonnable. En particulier, Mme Huang affirme que compte tenu du fait que son passeport comportait un timbre de sortie de la Chine daté du 8 avril 2006 et qu'il ne contenait aucun timbre ou visa d'autres pays au cours de la période suivant immédiatement cette date, la seule conclusion raisonnable à laquelle la juge de la citoyenneté pouvait en arriver était qu'elle était arrivée au Canada à cette date et qu'elle y était demeurée jusqu'à son prochain voyage déclaré. Je ne suis pas de cet avis.\n[57]\nLe passeport de Mme Huang témoigne de ses nombreux voyages, y compris en Australie, en Malaisie et aux États-Unis. Parmi ses absences déclarées du Canada au cours de la période pertinente, quatre l'ont été pour se rendre aux États-Unis (dossier certifié du tribunal, à la p. 128). En particulier dans le présent contexte, il n'était pas déraisonnable de la part de la juge de la citoyenneté de ne pas en inférer que Mme Huang se trouvait au Canada au cours de la période contestée tout simplement parce qu'elle n'était pas en Chine. Il incombait à Mme Huang de démontrer, suivant la prépondérance de la preuve, le nombre de jours qu'elle se trouvait au Canada. Contrairement à ce que Mme Huang prétend, le timbre de sortie de la Chine qui se trouve dans son passeport ne constitue pas [traduction]  une preuve fiable de ses entrées et de ses sorties du Canada .\n[58]\nMadame Huang conteste également l'affirmation de la juge de la citoyenneté suivant laquelle [traduction]  il n'y a aucun élément de preuve ou document à l'appui démontrant que la demanderesse était une résidente du Canada entre le 6 août 2005 et le 7 juin 2006 .\n[59]\nAprès avoir fait cette déclaration, la juge de la citoyenneté a reconnu que Mme Huang était arrivée au Canada pour une période de 49 jours entre le 22 octobre 2005 et le 10 décembre 2005. Mme Huang ne conteste donc que la période du 8 avril 2006 au 7 juin 2006.\n[60]\nCompte tenu de la lecture que je fais de cette partie de la décision de la juge de la citoyenneté dans son ensemble, je suis convaincu que la juge de la citoyenneté voulait dire qu'il n'y avait pas d'élément de preuve ou de document à l'appui pour\ndémontrer la façon convaincante\nque Mme Huang se trouvait au Canada au cours de la période contestée. La juge de la citoyenneté a analysé de façon appropriée les principaux documents sur lesquels Mme Huang se fondait pour démontrer sa présence au Canada au cours de la période en question. Toutefois, la juge de la citoyenneté a raisonnablement conclu que ces documents n'établissaient pas la présence de Mme Huang au Canada.\n[61]\nLes documents en question comprenaient certains renseignements témoignant d'activités sur des cartes de crédit et faisant état d'opérations en vue d'acheter une voiture et de souscrire à une assurance pour une voiture le 16 avril 2006 et le 30 avril 2006. Ces renseignements ne font état d'aucune autre opération au Canada avant le 7 juin 2006, tandis que d'autres renseignements fournis indiquaient que de nombreuses opérations avaient eu lieu sur le compte MasterCard de Mme Huang au cours de la période de 49 jours susmentionnée pendant laquelle elle se trouvait au Canada à la fin de 2005.\n[62]\nParmi les autres documents, mentionnons un contrat d'achat d'une voiture qui, suivant la juge de la citoyenneté, était très jauni, difficile à lire dont certaines parties n'avaient pas été remplies. La juge de la citoyenneté a notamment fait observer que le document n'était pas signé et que la partie consacrée à la vérification de l'identité n'était pas remplie. Elle a également fait observer que quelqu'un d'autre avait fort bien pu acheter le véhicule au Canada au nom de Mme Huang.\n[63]\nÀ mon avis, il n'était pas raisonnable de la part de la juge de la citoyenneté de conclure que les documents susmentionnés ne démontraient pas que Mme Huang se trouvait au Canada au cours de la période contestée, compte tenu notamment des incohérences susmentionnées relevées dans sa preuve et des observations de la juge de la citoyenneté suivant lesquelles: (i) Mme Huang n'avait pas produit de baux ou de contrats de location concernant des logements ou des résidences qu'elle aurait occupés au cours de la période contestée; (ii) la lettre de son médecin suivant laquelle elle ne l'avait pas consulté entre le 26 mars 2005 et le 20 juin 2006, date à laquelle elle l'avait rencontré à son retour alors qu'elle était enceinte de trois mois de son troisième enfant.\n[64]\nMadame Huang affirme qu'elle a fourni d'autres documents attestant sa présence au Canada au cours de la période contestée, y compris: (i) une facture de BC Hydro constatant un  virement  de 3,41 $; (ii) une facture de Shaw Cable; et (iii) des relevés de la Banque de Montréal. Toutefois, comme les autres pièces susmentionnées, ces documents ne démontrent pas à première vue que Mme Huang se trouvait au Canada pendant la période contestée et il n'était pas déraisonnable de la part de la juge de ne pas mentionner explicitement ces pièces. D'ailleurs, le relevé de BC Hydro fait état d'une consommation d'électricité très faible de seulement 3,75 $ pour la période du 16 mai 2006 au 13 juin 2006; la facture de Shaw Cable ne fait état d'aucuns frais antérieurs ou de solde impayé; quant aux opérations mentionnées dans le relevé de la Banque de Montréal, il s'agit de virements, de virements en ligne, de paiements préautorisés, de chèques, de virements électroniques reçus, de notes de débit et de rectification d'erreurs. Aucun de ces éléments ne démontre de façon convaincante que Mme Huang était effectivement présente au Canada. Ces opérations ont fort bien pu avoir été faites depuis l'étranger (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> à 26 et 80\n;\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[65]\nJe reconnais que la juge de la citoyenneté a pu commettre une erreur lorsqu'elle a fait observer que certaines des opérations de carte de crédit faisant état d'activités au Canada en juillet 2007 contredisaient une déclaration qu'aurait faite Mme Huang suivant laquelle elle se trouvait en Chine à l'époque. Toutefois, cette erreur ne porte pas à conséquence étant donné qu'elle ne se rapporte pas à la période contestée et qu'il semble qu'il soit admis aux débats que Mme Huang se trouvait au Canada à cette époque. Dans le même ordre d'idées, j'estime que l'erreur qu'aurait vraisemblablement commise la juge de la citoyenneté au sujet de l'opération de la carte de crédit qui correspondait à son avis à une opération faite en Chine le 28 mai 2006 ne tire pas à conséquence parce qu'elle ne semble pas avoir joué un rôle important dans sa conclusion suivant laquelle Mme Huang n'avait pas démontré selon la prépondérance de la preuve qu'elle se trouvait effectivement au Canada au cours de la période contestée.\n[66]\nPour ce qui est du cinquième facteur énoncé dans le jugement\nKoo\n, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que les absences de Mme Huang du Canada n'étaient pas attribuables à une situation temporaire, mais qu'elle s'expliquait par le fait qu'elle retournait en Chine auprès de son mari pour passer du temps avec sa famille immédiate et sa famille élargie. Madame Huang n'a pas contesté cette conclusion.\n[67]\nEnfin, en ce qui concerne le sixième facteur énoncé dans le jugement\nKoo\n, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu qu'il était [traduction]  évident que les liens de [Mme Huang] avec la Chine, l'endroit où elle est née, où elle a grandi, où elle a fait ses études, s'est mariée, où toute sa famille habite et où elle est retournée vivre sont des liens beaucoup plus solides que ceux qu'elle a avec le Canada . Là encore, Mme Huang n'a pas contesté cette conclusion.\n[68]\nVu tout ce qui précède, la juge de la citoyenneté a conclu que Mme Huang ne satisfaisait pas au critère de citoyenneté du jugement\nKoo\n.\n[69]\nÀ mon avis, cette conclusion appartenait  aux issues possibles acceptables pouvant se justifier au regard des faits et du droit  ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, au paragraphe 47). Elle était également raisonnablement justifiée, transparente et intelligible.\nC.\nLa juge de la citoyenneté a-t-elle mal évalué les compétences de Mme Huang en anglais?\n[70]\nCompte tenu des réponses que j'ai données aux deux des trois principales questions soulevées dans la présente demande, et compte tenu du fait que le critère de la citoyenneté énoncé au paragraphe 5(1) de la\nLoi sur la citoyenneté\nest cumulatif, il n'est pas nécessaire que j'aborde cette troisième question.\nDécision\n[71]\nPour les motifs qui ont été exposés, le présent appel est rejeté.\n[72]\nLe défendeur a réclamé les dépens dans la présente instance. Je ne suis cependant pas convaincu que les faits de la présente espèce sont suffisamment exceptionnels pour justifier l'exercice de mon pouvoir discrétionnaire de manière à accéder à cette demande (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nJUGEMENT\n[73]\nLA COUR REJETTE\nl'appel.\n[End of document]",

The Court has noted this on several occasions\n(\nsee, for example,\nHarry (Re)\n[1998] FCJ No 189, at paras 15-26;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nHao\n]; and\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). Another potential approach would be for a citizenship judge to bring a reference to the Court under subsection 18.3(1) of the\nFederal Courts Act\n, RSC 1985, c F-7 [\nFC Act\n]. Among other things, this would provide an opportunity for the issue to then be brought before the Federal Court of Appeal, pursuant to paragraph 27(1)(d) of the\nFC Act\n, to finally settle the divergence in this Court's jurisprudence that has persisted now for several decades.\n1.\nOverview\n\n[3]\nThe Applicant, Ms. Huang, is appealing an adverse determination by a citizenship judge of her application for citizenship.\n\n[4]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge erred by:\ni. breaching the principles of procedural fairness in handling her case;\nii. failing to properly assess her residence in Canada; and\niii. failing to properly assess her proficiency in English.\n\n[5]\nI disagree. For the reasons that follow, this appeal is dismissed.\n2.\nBackground Facts\n\n[6]\nMs. Huang is a citizen of China. She arrived in Canada on February 26, 2005, on an investor class visa.\n\n[7]\nAfter several trips back and forth between Canada and China, including two in which she gave birth to a child here, she applied for Canadian citizenship on August 6, 2009.\n\n[8]\nAccordingly, the relevant period [Relevant Period] for the purposes of calculating her residence was from August 6, 2005 to August 6, 2009.\n3.\nRelevant legislation\n\n[9]\nSubsection 5(1) of the\nCitizenship Act\nsets forth a conjunctive test for citizenship. That provision states:\nThe Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who\n(a) makes application for citizenship;\n(b) is eighteen years of age or over;\n(c) is a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada calculated in the following manner:\n(i) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada before his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one-half of a day of residence, and\n(ii) for every day during which the person was resident in Canada after his lawful admission to Canada for permanent residence the person shall be deemed to have accumulated one day of residence;\n(d) has an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada;\n(e) has an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship; and\n(f) is not under a removal order and is not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20.\n\n[10]\nPursuant to subsection 14(6), and subject to section 20 (which is not relevant to this case), no appeal lies from a decision of this Court on an appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge.\n4.\nStandard of Review\n\n[11]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to procedural fairness is reviewable on a standard of correctness (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 55 and 79 [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para. 43).\n\n[12]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to the citizenship judge's assessment of Ms. Huang's residence in Canada has two prongs. Generally speaking, the first prong concerns the legal test for citizenship, namely, whether it was open to the citizenship judge to apply a particular test. That is a question of law which concerns the interpretation of section 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nand this Court's jurisprudence.\n\n[13]\nIn interpreting the\nCitizenship Act\n, a citizenship judge is interpreting either his or her \"home statute\" or a statute closely connected with the judge's function, and with which he or she can be presumed to have particular familiarity. The Supreme Court of Canada's jurisprudence teaches that, absent exceptional circumstances, determinations reached by administrative tribunals in this context should be presumed to be reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (\nAlberta (Information and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 34 [\nAlberta Teachers\n]).\n\n[14]\nOne such exceptional circumstance is where the question of law is \"of central importance to the legal system as a whole and ... outside the adjudicator's expertise\" (\nAlberta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at paras 30, 34 and 43).  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nMartinez\n], Justice Rennie concluded, in\nobiter\n, that the interpretation of section 5 of the\nCitizenship Act\nis such a question. While I am very sympathetic to his reasoning, I am reluctant to embrace it because the Supreme Court subsequently noted that it had yet to encounter the type of exceptional situation involving statutory interpretation that would merit review on a standard of correctness\n(Alberta  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 34; see also\nHao\n, above, at para 39).\n\n[15]\nAs noted above, the issue of the legal test for citizenship concerns not only the interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act,\nbut also the interpretation of this Court's extensive jurisprudence on this issue.\n\n[16]\nThe specific question of law that has been raised by Ms. Huang is whether the Citizenship judge was entitled to apply the test articulated by this Court in\nKoo (Re)\n[1993] 1 FC 286, at para 10 [\nKoo\n].\n\n[17]\nAs discussed in part 5.B of these reasons below, the test set forth in\nKoo\n, above, is one of three tests for citizenship that have long been established in this Court's jurisprudence. It is a qualitative test that is similar to one of the other tests, and is very different from the third test (the \"physical presence\" test), which is quantitative in nature.\n\n[18]\nThese three tests continue to be embraced by this Court. The ongoing existence of this divergence of views within the Court reflects a very peculiar state of the law that developed and has persisted in part due to the fact that, pursuant to subsection 14(6) of the\nCitizenship Act\n, no appeal lies from a decision of this Court on an appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge.\n\n[19]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nLam\n], Justice Lutfy, as he then was, took note of this \"conflicting jurisprudence,\" which essentially pertains to the proper interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n. He observed, at paragraph 11, that \"[t]he divergence of views, both in this Court and among citizenship judges, has brought uncertainty to the administration of justice in these matters.\" However, given that legislation which would have clarified the citizenship test was then pending, he concluded that, during the period of transition, deference should be accorded to a citizenship judge's choice of which of the three tests to apply, provided that he or she demonstrates an understanding of the case law and properly decides that the facts meet the test that has been applied (\nLam\n, above, at para 33).\n\n[20]\nA decade later, in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], at paragraph 44, Justice Mainville observed that over the course of the intervening period the approach adopted by Justice Lutfy had been largely followed. However, after noting that the decision in\nLam\nhad been \"rendered in a situation that was perceived to be temporary given the statutory amendments that were under consideration at that time,\" he concluded that the time had come to settle upon a single interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) if the\nCitizenship Act\n. To this end, and after observing that the test set forth in\nKoo\nhad become the dominant test in this Court's jurisprudence, he concluded that this test should henceforth be the sole test to be applied under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n). He reached that conclusion notwithstanding his view that the \"physical presence test,\" discussed below, appears to have been contemplated by the clear wording of that provision.\n\n[21]\nAs it has turned out, Justice Mainville's laudable \"attempt to standardize the applicable law\" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above at para 47), has not been successful. In short, while his view that the\nKoo\ntest should be the sole standard has been endorsed in several subsequent decisions of this Court (see for example, the cases listed in\nHao\n, above, at para 42, and in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nEl Khader\n]; see also <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 32), a citizenship judge's discretion to apply one of the other recognized tests has been upheld in several other decisions (see, for example\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nHao\n, above, at paras 48-50;\nEl  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 23;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [\nSaad\n];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]).\n\n[22]\nIndeed, this Court has held in a number of other decisions that the \"physical presence\" test, discussed below, is the correct test to apply (\nMartinez\n, above, at para 52;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[23]\nIn other decisions, the Court appears to have adopted a hybrid approach, which would require a citizenship judge to proceed to conduct a qualitative assessment, as contemplated by the\nKoo\ntest, even if the \"physical presence\" test has been selected by the citizenship judge and failed by the applicant (\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [ <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ];\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[24]\nWhat is clear from the foregoing is that the jurisprudence pertaining to the test(s) for citizenship remains divided and somewhat unsettled.\n\n[25]\nIn this context, it is particularly appropriate that deference be accorded to a citizenship judge's decision to apply any of the three tests that have a long and rich heritage in this Court's jurisprudence.\n\n[26]\nThis conclusion is consistent with the dominant view in this Court that the standard to be applied in reviewing a citizenship judge's decision reasonableness (\nSaad\n, above, at para 9;\nHao\n, above, at para 13; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 8; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13).\n\n[27]\nThe second prong of the issue that has been raised regarding the citizenship judge's assessment of Ms. Huang's application for citizenship concerns the application of the legal test for citizenship to the facts of this case. That is a question of mixed fact and law that is also reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.\n\n[28]\nThe issue that has been raised with respect to whether the Citizenship judge erred by failing to properly assess her proficiency in English is also a question of mixed fact and law that is subject to review on a standard of reasonableness.\n5.\nAnalysis\nA.\nDid the citizenship judge breach the principles of procedural fairness in handling Ms. Huang's case?\n\n[29]\nMs. Huang submits that her procedural fairness rights were breached because she was not given adequate notice of her interview with the Citizenship judge, and because the interview notice did not advise her of the purpose of the interview. I disagree.\n\n[30]\nIn a letter dated October 25, 2010, Ms. Huang was advised that the citizenship judge required further information and that further processing of her application could not continue until she supplied that information.\n\n[31]\nThen, on February 21, 2011, Ms. Huang was advised by way of a form letter that the information she had supplied had been reviewed and that the citizenship judge requested a hearing to finalize the processing of her application. That letter also advised that her appointment with the Citizenship judge was \"for residency assessment.\"\n\n[32]\nOn April 4, 2011, Ms. Huang received a Notice to Appear from the Citizenship Office in Vancouver, requesting her to appear for an interview the following day. Among other things, that notice stated that she would \"be asked questions to determine if [she had] an adequate knowledge of English or French and an adequate knowledge of Canada.\" In addition, the notice stated: \"If you do not attend this hearing, at the above date, time and place, you will receive a second and final notice.\"\n\n[33]\nIn my view, the Notice to Appear sent on April 4, 2011 must be viewed together with the form letter that was sent on February 21, 2011. When those two written communications are viewed together, it is clear that Ms. Huang was given more than adequate notice to appear for her interview. She was also clearly informed that residency and language issues would be addressed during that interview. With this in mind, and given that she was informed that she would be given another opportunity to appear if she did not appear for her scheduled interview on April 5, 2011, her procedural fairness rights were not breached by virtue of the amount of notice she was given or the topics that were covered in the interview.\n\n[34]\nMy conclusion in this regard is reinforced by the fact that, following her interview, Ms. Huang was provided an opportunity to supply further information. In addition, she does not appear to have objected, at the time of her interview, to the short notice that had been given in the Notice to Appear, and she was accompanied by an interpreter.\n\n[35]\nMs. Huang also asserts that the citizenship judge did not conduct herself in an objective and independent manner. This allegation appears to rest on the fact that the citizenship judge re-tested Ms. Huang's knowledge of English and knowledge of Canada during the interview, notwithstanding that she had passed a prior written test. Given the nature of the written notices, summarized above, that she received, I am satisfied that the citizenship judge's decision to re-test Ms. Huang on these matters during the interview did not breach her procedural fairness rights.\nB.\nDid the Citizenship judge fail to properly assess Ms. Huang's residence in Canada?\ni.\nThe test for citizenship that was applied\n\n[36]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge erred by applying the test articulated in\nKoo\n, above, rather than the \"physical presence\" test. I disagree.\n\n[37]\nAs noted above, the jurisprudence of this Court has established three tests for citizenship. These are generally known as the \"centralized mode of living\" test, the\nKoo\ntest (which focuses upon where the applicant \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\") and the \"physical presence\" test.\n\n[38]\nIt is now well established that before any of these tests can be applied, an applicant for citizenship must establish that he or she is physically resident in Canada ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 50;\nMartinez\n, above, at para 9;\nHao\n, above, at para 24; <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para 13).\n\n[39]\nThe \"centralized mode of living test\" was articulated by Associate Chief Justice Thurlow, as he then was, in\nPapadogiorgakis (Re)\n, [1978] 2 FC 208, at paras 16-17 [\nPapadogiorgakis\n]. This test is a qualitative test that focuses upon \"the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question,\" even though the person may have lengthy absences from Canada.\n\n[40]\nThe \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" test was established by Justice Reed, in\nKoo\n, above, at para 10, who identified six factors to guide the assessment of whether this test has been met in any given case. Those factors will be discussed in the next section of these reasons below.\n\n[41]\nThe \"physical presence\" test is commonly attributed to Justice Muldoon, who stated in\nPourghasemi (Re)\n, [1993] FCJ No 232, at paras 3-9 [\nPourghasemi\n], that paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\nrequires, among other things, that an applicant for citizenship be physically present for a minimum of three years (1,095 days) in the four year period immediately preceding his application.\n\n[42]\nIn\nLam\n, above, Justice Lutfy, as he then was, held that \"it is open to the citizenship judge to adopt either one of the conflicting schools in this Court and, if the facts of the case were properly applied to the principles of the chose approach, the decision of the citizenship judge would not be wrong\" (\nLam\n, above, at para 14).\n\n[43]\nAs it turned out, the proposed legislation discussed in\nLam\nwas not enacted. Nevertheless, in my view, a reasonable interpretation of this Court's jurisprudence is that the law as articulated by Justice Lutfy has not changed with respect to a citizenship judge's ability to apply any one of the three tests for citizenship described above (see the second line of cases referred to at paragraph 21 above). I have reached this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that I personally find the reasoning in\nMartinez\n, above, and its progeny to be compelling. As noted at paragraph 22 above, that line of jurisprudence holds that the physical presence test is the correct test to apply, and is indeed the only one contemplated by paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\n.\n\n[44]\nHowever, with respect to those who hold a contrary view, I do not believe that this Court's jurisprudence, on balance, supports an approach that would effectively\nrequire\na blending of two or more of the three aforementioned tests (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 31). For example, if a citizenship judge decides to apply the physical presence test and concludes that the applicant in question did not meet that test, it would be inconsistent with a fair reading of the main branches of this Court's jurisprudence (namely, the approaches set forth in\nPapadogiorgakis, Pourghasemi, Koo\nand\nLam,\nrespectively, and in their respective progenies) for the citizenship judge to be\nrequired\nto then apply the\nKoo\ntest or the \"centralized mode of living test.\" This would effectively require the citizenship judge to give the applicant \"two kicks at the can.\" In the present state of the Court's jurisprudence, it would be reasonably open to the citizenship judge to terminate the assessment under paragraph 5(1)(\nc\n) of the\nCitizenship Act\nupon concluding that the physical presence test had not been met by the applicant.\n\n[45]\nIn this case, that is not what happened. The citizenship judge appears to have decided to not apply the physical presence test, after concluding that she was not satisfied that the information provided by Ms. Huang accurately reflected the number of days that she was, in fact, physically present in Canada. She therefore decided to apply the\nKoo\ntest. Under the longstanding jurisprudence of this Court, she was at liberty to do so. Stated differently, it was reasonably open for her to do so. This was well \"within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). This aspect of the decision under review was also reasonably justified, transparent and intelligible.\n\n[46]\nMs. Huang also takes issue with the citizenship judge's use of the words \"in fact,\" and asserts that this imposed a higher threshold than a \"balance of probabilities.\" I disagree.\n\n[47]\nThe citizenship judge explicitly stated that she was \"not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities\" that the information supplied by Ms. Huang accurately reflected the number of days that she was, in fact, physically present in Canada. Based on my reading of the decision as a whole, I am satisfied that she did not apply a standard different from the balance of probabilities standard she stated she had applied.\ni.\nThe Citizenship judge's application of the Koo test to the facts in the record\n\n[48]\nMs. Huang submits that the citizenship judge misapprehended several aspects of the evidentiary record and, that as a result of those errors, the conclusion that she had not satisfied the test for citizenship was unreasonable. I disagree.\n\n[49]\nIn\nKoo\n, above, Justice Reed identified the following six questions to be addressed in determining whether an applicant for citizenship \"regularly, normally or customarily\" lives in Canada:\ni. Was the individual physically present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences which occurred immediately before the application for citizenship?\nii. Where are the applicant's immediate family and dependents (and extended family) resident?\niii. Does the pattern of physical presence in Canada indicate a returning home or merely visiting the country?\niv. What is the extent of the physical absences - if an applicant is only a few days short of the 1,095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence than if those absences are extensive?\nv. Is the physical absence caused by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, accompanying a spouse who has accepted employment abroad?\nvi. What is the quality of the connection with Canada: is it more substantial than that which exists with any other country?\n\n[50]\nWith respect to the first factor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang had only been in Canada for a total of 99 days prior to the Relevant Period, and that this did not constitute a \"long period\" as contemplated by\nKoo\n, above. Ms. Huang did not take issue with this finding.\n\n[51]\nWith respect to the second factor, the citizenship judge concluded that the applicant lives with her husband, daughter and two sons in China, where her parents, her two sisters and her extended family also live. The citizenship judge also noted that Ms. Huang has no relatives living in Canada. Ms. Huang did not take issue with this finding.\n\n[52]\nTurning to the third factor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang's travel history between China and Canada reflects that her home is in China, and that she simply visited Canada for the purpose of giving birth to two of her children here, and to give her eldest and middle children the opportunity to attend school and preschool here. In my view, this conclusion is entirely consistent with the facts in the record.\n\n[53]\nIn reaching that conclusion, the citizenship judge identified a number of inconsistencies in the materials that had been submitted by Ms. Huang in support of her application. For example, in her Residence Questionnaire, she indicated that she resided in Canada with her husband from February 2005 until November 21, 2010, and that, from May 2006 to the end of that period she lived at a particular address in Richmond, British Columbia from May 2006. However, during the hearing, she acknowledged that her husband returned to live in China in 2005, that he only returned for a few months each year to live with her and that she returned to live with him on August 21, 2009.\n\n[54]\nIn the course of reaching her conclusion with respect to this third\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge also questioned some of the documentation that Ms. Huang had provided to support her position that she was present in Canada between April 8, 2006 and June 6, 2006. Ms. Huang asserts that this aspect of the citizenship judge's analysis was unreasonable. I will deal with Ms. Huang's submissions in this regard below, as this aspect of the citizenship judge's analysis overlaps with her assessment of the fourth\nKoo\nfactor.\n\n[55]\nIn assessing the fourth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang fell 54 days short of the 1,095 days specified in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Citizenship Act. She reached this conclusion after stating that she had not been convinced that Ms. Huang had been present in Canada for the 59 day period between April 8, 2006 and June 7, 2006 [Disputed Period].\n\n[56]\nAs noted above, Ms. Huang asserts that this finding was not reasonable. In particular, Ms. Huang states that, based on the fact that her passport was stamped with an exit stamp from China on April 8, 2006 and did not contain entry stamps or visas from other countries during that period immediately following that date, the only reasonable conclusion available to the citizenship judge was that she entered Canada on that date and remained there until her next declared trip. I disagree.\n\n[57]\nMs. Huang's passport reflects a very active travel history, including to Australia, Malaysia, and the United States. Among her declared absences from Canada during the Relevant Period, four were to the United States (Certified Tribunal Record, at p 128). Particularly in this context, it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to fail to infer that Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period, simply because she was not in China. The burden was on Ms. Huang's to establish on a balance of probabilities the number of days that she was in Canada. Contrary to Ms. Huang's position, the exit stamp from China in her passport is not \"reliable proof as far as her travel in and out of Canada is concerned.\"\n\n[58]\nMs. Huang also takes issue with the citizenship judge's statement that \"[t]here is no supporting evidence or documentation to show that the applicant was resident in Canada between August 6, 2005 and June 7, 2006.\"\n\n[59]\nAfter making that statement, the citizenship judge acknowledged that Ms. Huang came to Canada for 49 days between October 22, 2005 and December 10, 2005. Ms. Huang therefore only takes issue with respect to the period April 8, 2006 and June 7, 2006.\n\n[60]\nBased on my reading of this part of the citizenship judge's decision as a whole, I am satisfied that what the citizenship judge meant is that there was no supporting evidence or documentation to\npersuasively establish\nthat Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period. The citizenship judge appropriately discussed the principal documentation that Ms. Huang relies upon to establish her presence in Canada during that period. However, the citizenship judge reasonably concluded that it did not establish such presence.\n\n[61]\nThe documentation in question included information with respect to credit card activity that reflected transactions to purchase a car and car insurance on April 16, 2006 and April 30, 2006. That information did not reflect any other transactions in Canada until June 7, 2006, whereas other information that had been provided reflected significant activity in Canada on Ms. Huang's MasterCard during the aforementioned 49 day period that she was in Canada in late 2005.\n\n[62]\nOther documentation included a car purchase document that the citizenship judge found to be very faded, difficult to read, and to contain unfilled sections, including uncompleted signature and identification verification sections. The citizenship judge observed that someone else could well have purchased the vehicle in Canada on Ms. Huang's behalf.\n\n[63]\nIn my view, it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to conclude that the foregoing documentation did not establish that Ms. Huang was in Canada during the Disputed Period, particularly given the previously mentioned inconsistencies in her evidence and the citizenship judge's observations that (i) Ms. Huang did not provide any leases or rental agreements for any accommodation or residence during the Disputed Period, and (ii) a letter from her doctor states that there were no visits between March 26, 2005 and June 20, 2006, when she returned, three months into her pregnancy with her third child.\n\n[64]\nMs. Huang asserts that she provided other documentation evidencing her presence in Canada during the Disputed Period, including (i) an invoice from BC Hydro evidencing a \"transfer\" payment in the amount of $3.41; (ii) an invoice from Shaw Cable; and (iii) statements from the Bank of Montreal. However, as with the other documentation discussed above, this documentation does not demonstrate on its face that Ms. Huang was present in Canada during the Disputed Period, and it was not unreasonable for the citizenship judge to fail to explicitly address this documentation. Indeed, the invoice from BC Hydro reflects a very low electricity usage charge of only $3.75 for the period May 16, 2006 to June 13, 2006; the invoice from Shaw Cable does not evidence any previous charges or outstanding balance; and the transactions identified in the Bank of Montreal statement consist of transfers, online transfers, pre-authorized payments, cheques, incoming wire payments, debit memos and error corrections. None of this persuasively demonstrates that Ms. Huang was physically present in Canada. This was all activity that may well have been conducted from abroad (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n\n[65]\nI acknowledge that the citizenship judge may have erred when she observed that certain credit card transactions reflecting activity in Canada in July 2007 were inconsistent with a statement allegedly made by Ms. Huang that she was in China at that time. However, this error is not material, as it did not relate to the Disputed Period, and Ms. Huang appears to have been given credit for being in Canada at that time. Likewise, I do not consider the citizenship judge's apparent error regarding a credit card transaction that she believed reflected a transaction in China on May 28, 2006 to be material, because it does not appear to have played a material role in the conclusion that Ms. Huang had not established on a balance of probabilities that she was physically present during the Disputed Period.\n\n[66]\nTuring to the fifth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang's absences from Canada were not due to any temporary situation, but rather involved returns to China to be with her husband and to spend time with her immediate and extended family. Ms. Huang did not contest this finding.\n\n[67]\nFinally, with respect to the sixth\nKoo\nfactor, the citizenship judge concluded it was \"evident that [Ms. Huang's] ties to China, the place where she was born, raised, educated, married, where her entire family resides, and where she has returned to live, are significantly stronger than her ties to Canada.\" Once again, Ms. Huang did not contest this finding.\n\n[68]\nBased on all of the foregoing, the citizenship judge concluded that Ms. Huang did not satisfy the\nKoo\ntest for citizenship.\n\n[69]\nIn my view, that conclusion was well \"within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\" (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at para 47). It was also reasonably justified, transparent and intelligible.\nC.\nDid the Citizenship judge fail to properly assess Ms. Huang's proficiency in English?\n\n[70]\nGiven my responses to the first two of the three principle issues raised in this application, and given that the test for citizenship set forth in subsection 5(1) of the\nCitizenship Act\nis conjunctive, it is unnecessary for me to address this third issue.\nConclusion\n\n[71]\nFor the reasons set forth above, this appeal is dismissed.\n\n[72]\nThe Respondent has sought its costs in this proceeding. However, I am not satisfied that facts in this case are sufficiently exceptional to warrant the exercise of my discretion to grant this request (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\nJUDGMENT\n\n[73]\nLA COUR REJETTE\nl'appel.\n[End of document]",

      "The court acknowledged the existing divergence in jurisprudence regarding the correct test for citizenship (centralized mode of living, Koo test, and physical presence test) and the lack of clear legislative guidance from Parliament.

It rejected the argument that the judge imposed a higher standard than 'balance of probabilities' when assessing Ms. Huang’s physical presence.",
      "The court thoroughly reviewed the evidence related to Ms. Huang’s residency, finding the citizenship judge’s assessment of inconsistencies in her documentation and travel history to be reasonable. The judge’s skepticism regarding Ms. Huang’s presence during a specific period (April 8 - June 7, 2006) was supported by the lack of corroborating evidence and inconsistencies in her account.",
      "The court found the citizenship judge’s conclusions regarding Ms. Huang’s stronger ties to China, and the non-temporary nature of her absences, to be supported by the record and not contested by Ms. Huang.",
