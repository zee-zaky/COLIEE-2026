    "[12]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is granted. The agent's decision is set aside, and the matter is referred back to Citizenship and Immigration Canada for reconsideration by a different agent. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> applicant submitted an application for permanent residency under the Federal Skilled Worker category, based on his reported experience as a driller and blaster, National Occupational Classification (NOC) code 7372. He holds a bachelor's degree in geology and a certificate in blasting from the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, Nigeria. He works as a career supervisor in Nigeria. [2]\nSubsection 75(2) of\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n, SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations) describes the skilled worker, among other things, as the foreign national who has performed all of the tasks appearing in the main statement established for the profession in the occupational descriptions of the National Occupational Classification, and who has performed an appreciable part of the main functions of the profession, in particular all the essential functions. [3]\nA Citizenship and Immigration Canada officer determined that the applicant had not provided proof that he met these requirements and that his application could not be processed further, in accordance with subsection 75(3) of the Regulations. [4]\nThe decision is a standard letter indicating that the officer was not satisfied that the applicant had performed the tasks set out in the primary statement established for the profession or performed an appreciable portion of the primary functions of the profession. The agent subsequently swore, for the purposes of this judicial review, an affidavit in which she declared that the evidence presented by the applicant established that he had already performed only two of the main functions of the profession. [5]\nDecision-makers cannot supplement their reasons with an affidavit, but they can explain the notes taken at the time of the decision:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and 25. [6]\nIn this case, the officer did not take notes to describe her reasoning. The affidavit was sworn on July 30, 2012, three months after the decision, calling into question its reliability. Obviously, the affidavit does not amount to a simple explanation of the officer's notes, since there are no notes; rather, it serves as the reasons for the decision. It is therefore inadmissible. [7]\nThe applicant's employer provided a letter which states, among other things, that the applicant: (a) plans, supervises and coordinates drilling operations, (b) maps holes and determines their diameter and spacing, (c) decides when to suspend or continue drilling, (d) calculates the quantity of explosives required, (e) supervises subordinates who carry out loading operations, (g) ensures that safety measures are applied, and (h) connects the blast circuit. [8]\nAccording to the NOC occupational description, blasters in this group load explosives into blast holes and detonate charges. Six main functions are listed, several of which could correspond to the tasks described in the plaintiff's evidence, in particular tasks (b), (e), (g) and (h) noted above. It is not for the Court to determine whether the applicant has in fact performed the tasks set out in the main statement and an appreciable part of the main functions. It is up to the officer to do so and explain their reasoning, which may give rise to judicial review. As Justice Richard Mosley ruled in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> it is impossible to assess the reasonableness of the officer's conclusions without knowing which duties were not performed. [9]\nThe decision sheds no light on the officer's reasoning. The agent simply stated her conclusion, without explaining it. It is impossible to know how she arrived at this decision. [10]\nThe stop\nNewfoundland and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , does not validate the decision. The stop\nNewfoundland Nurses\nestablishes that judicial review concerns the decision itself, not the decision-making process. Where evident, gaps in the evidence may be filled if it is possible to do so on the basis of evidence and logical inferences, virtually included in the result, but not expressly drawn. The reviewing court examines the file with the aim of confirming the decision. [11]\nThe stop\nNewfoundland Nurses\ndoes not give the Court full latitude to provide reasons which have not been given, nor does it authorize it to guess what conclusions might have been reached or to speculate on what the court may have thought. This is particularly the case when the reasons ignore an essential issue. It is ironic that the ruling\nNewfoundland Nurses\n, a case that is essentially about deference and standard of review, be invoked as the precedent that would direct the court with supervisory power to do the work omitted by the decision maker, to provide the reasons that could have been given, and to make the findings of fact that were not made. This is applying case law in reverse. The stop\nNewfoundland Nurses\nallows control lessons to connect the dots on the page when the lines, and the direction they take, can be easily discerned. Here, there aren't even any dots on the page.\nJUDGMENT [12]\nTHE COURT RULES that\nthe application for judicial review is granted.

The agent's decision is set aside, and the matter is referred back to Citizenship and Immigration Canada for reconsideration by a different agent. There is no question for certification.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  demandeur a présenté une demande de résidence permanente au titre de la catégorie des travailleurs qualifiés (fédéral), fondée sur son expérience déclarée à titre de foreur et de dynamiteur, code 7372 de la Classification nationale des professions (CNP). Il est titulaire d'un baccalauréat en géologie et d'un certificat en dynamitage délivré par le ministère des Mines et du Développement de l'acier du Nigeria. Il travaille comme superviseur de carrière au Nigeria.\n[2]\nLe paragraphe 75(2) du\nRèglement sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, DORS/2002-227 (le Règlement) décrit le travailleur qualifié entre autres comme l'étranger qui a accompli l'ensemble des tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession dans les descriptions des professions de la Classification nationale des professions, et qui a exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession, notamment toutes les fonctions  essentielles .\n[3]\nUne agente de Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada a déterminé que le demandeur n'avait pas fourni de preuve établissant qu'il satisfaisait à ces exigences et que sa demande ne pouvait être traitée plus avant, conformément au paragraphe 75(3) du Règlement.\n[4]\nLa décision est une lettre type indiquant que l'agente n'était pas convaincue que le demandeur avait accompli les tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal établi pour la profession ou exercé une partie appréciable des fonctions principales de la profession. L'agente a par la suite souscrit, aux fins du présent contrôle judiciaire, un affidavit dans lequel elle déclare que la preuve présentée par le demandeur établissait que celui-ci avait déjà accompli seulement deux des fonctions principales de la profession.\n[5]\nLes décideurs ne peuvent compléter leurs motifs par un affidavit, mais ils peuvent expliquer les notes prises au moment de la décision:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> et 25.\n[6]\nEn l'espèce, l'agente n'a pas pris de notes pour décrire son raisonnement. L'affidavit a été souscrit le 30 juillet 2012, trois mois après la décision, ce qui remet en question sa fiabilité. Évidemment, l'affidavit ne se résume pas à une simple explication des notes de l'agente, puisqu'il n'y a pas de notes; il sert plutôt de motifs de la décision. Il est donc irrecevable.\n[7]\nL'employeur du demandeur a fourni une lettre dans laquelle il est dit, entre autres, que le demandeur: a) planifie, supervise et coordonne des opérations de forage, b) dresse la carte des trous et détermine leur diamètre et leur espacement, c) décide quand suspendre ou poursuivre le forage, d) calcule la quantité d'explosifs requis, e) supervise les subordonnés qui exécutent des opérations de chargement, g) veille à l'application des mesures de sécurité, et h) raccorde le circuit de tir.\n[8]\nSelon la description de la profession énoncée dans la CNP,  [l] es dynamiteurs de ce groupe chargent des explosifs dans des trous de dynamitage et font exploser des charges . Six fonctions principales sont énumérées, dont plusieurs pourraient correspondre aux tâches décrites dans la preuve du demandeur, en particulier les tâches b), e), g) et h) indiquées ci-dessus. Il ne revient pas à la Cour de déterminer si le demandeur a bel et bien accompli les tâches figurant dans l'énoncé principal et une partie appréciable des fonctions principales. Il incombe à l'agent de le faire et d'expliquer son raisonnement, qui peut donner ouverture à contrôle judiciaire. Comme le juge Richard Mosley a statué dans\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  il est impossible d'évaluer le caractère raisonnable des conclusions de l'agent sans savoir quelles fonctions n'ont pas été exercées.\n[9]\nLa décision ne jette aucune lumière sur le raisonnement de l'agente. L'agente s'est contentée d'énoncer sa conclusion, sans l'expliquer. Il est impossible de savoir comment elle est parvenue à cette décision.\n[10]\nL'arrêt\nNewfoundland and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ne valide pas la décision. L'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\nétablit que le contrôle judiciaire porte sur la décision en soi, et non sur le processus décisionnel. Lorsqu'elles sont manifestes, les lacunes de la preuve peuvent être comblées s'il est possible de le faire en s'appuyant sur la preuve et sur des inférences logiques, virtuellement comprises dans le résultat, mais non expressément tirées. La cour de révision examine le dossier dans le but de confirmer la décision.\n[11]\nL'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\nne donne pas à la Cour toute la latitude voulue pour fournir des motifs qui n'ont pas été donnés, ni ne l'autorise à deviner quelles conclusions auraient pu être tirées ou à émettre des hypothèses sur ce que le tribunal a pu penser. C'est particulièrement le cas quand les motifs passent sous silence une question essentielle. Il est ironique que l'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\n, une affaire qui concerne essentiellement la déférence et la norme de contrôle, soit invoqué comme le précédent qui commanderait au tribunal ayant le pouvoir de surveillance de faire le travail omis par le décideur, de fournir les motifs qui auraient pu être donnés et de formuler les conclusions de fait qui n'ont pas été tirées. C'est appliquer la jurisprudence à l'envers. L'arrêt\nNewfoundland Nurses\npermet aux cours de contrôle de relier les points sur la page quand les lignes, et la direction qu'elles prennent, peuvent être facilement discernées. Ici, il n'y a même pas de points sur la page.\nJUGEMENT\n[12]\nLA COUR STATUE que\nla demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie. La décision de l'agent est annulée, et l'affaire est renvoyée à Citoyenneté et Immigration Canada pour nouvel examen par un autre agent. Il n'y a pas de question à certifier.\n[End of document]",

      "An individual applied for permanent residency in Canada under the Federal Skilled Worker class.",

      "The applicant possesses a bachelor’s degree in geology and a blasting certificate from a Nigerian institution.",
      "The applicant is employed as a quarry supervisor in Nigeria.",
      "A Citizenship and Immigration Canada agent determined the applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to meet the requirements for the skilled worker class.",
      "The agent’s decision was communicated via a standard letter lacking detailed reasoning.",
      "Subsequently, the agent submitted an affidavit stating the applicant’s evidence demonstrated experience in only two of the occupation’s main duties.",
      "The applicant’s employer provided a letter detailing the applicant’s responsibilities, including supervising drilling operations, calculating explosives, and ensuring safety.",

        "Applicant meets the requirements of subsection 75(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations as a skilled worker under NOC 7372 (driller and blaster).",

        "Applicant’s employer letter demonstrates experience performing duties corresponding to the NOC 7372 description, including scheduling/supervising drilling, mapping holes, calculating explosives, supervising charging, ensuring safety, and connecting blasting circuits.",
        "The agent’s decision lacked reasoning and explanation, failing to identify which duties were not performed.",
        "The agent’s affidavit submitted for judicial review was inadmissible as it was created three months after the initial decision and served as new reasons, rather than an explanation of existing notes.",
        "The decision should be set aside and reconsidered by a different agent."

      "Respondents": [
        "Applicant did not provide evidence satisfying the requirements of subsection 75(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.",
        "Applicant did not perform the tasks described in the lead statement for the occupation of driller and blaster (NOC 7372) or a substantial number of the main duties.",
        "The agent’s initial decision was based on a lack of sufficient evidence of the applicant’s experience.",
        "The agent’s affidavit was permissible to clarify the basis of the decision.",
        "The principles in *Newfoundland Nurses* allow for filling evidentiary gaps with logical inferences and upholding the decision."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court found the agent's decision to deny the applicant's permanent residency application invalid due to a lack of reasoned explanation. The agent simply stated a conclusion without detailing *why* the applicant did not meet the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.",
      "The court deemed the agent's subsequent affidavit inadmissible as evidence of the reasoning behind the decision. The affidavit was created three months after the initial decision and, crucially, lacked any contemporaneous notes to support it; it essentially *replaced* reasons rather than explaining them, violating established legal principles regarding supplementing reasons with affidavits.",
      "The court acknowledged that the applicant's employer's letter provided evidence of duties that arguably aligned with the NOC description for a driller and blaster. However, it emphasized that *determining whether these duties met the regulatory requirements was the agent's responsibility*, not the court's.",
      "The court rejected the argument that the principle established in *Newfoundland Nurses* allowed it to fill gaps in the agent's reasoning. It clarified that *Newfoundland Nurses* permits connecting readily apparent dots, but does not authorize the court to create reasons where none exist or to speculate on the agent's thought process, especially concerning a critical issue like which duties were not performed.",
      "The court applied the principle that a reviewing court must be able to assess the reasonableness of a decision, which requires understanding the basis for that decision. The complete absence of reasoning in the agent's decision made it impossible to conduct a meaningful review, leading to the granting of judicial review and referral of the case back to Citizenship and Immigration Canada for reconsideration by a different agent."
    ],
    "final_outcome": [
      "The application for judicial review is granted.",
      "The agent's decision is set aside.",
      "The matter is referred back to Citizenship and Immigration Canada for reconsideration by a different agent.",
      "There is no question for certification."
