    "[0]\n<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  CF 1519)\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> \nFederal Court\nO'Keefe, J.\nDecember 20, 2012.\nCounsel:\nLoftus Cuddy, for the applicant;\nCatherine Vasilaros, for the respondent.\nSolicitors of Record:\nLoftus Cuddy, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;\nWilliam F. Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.",
    "[1]\nO'Keefe, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), dated February 28, 2012, wherein the applicant was determined to be neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Act.",
    "[2]\nThe applicant requests that the Board's decision be set aside and the application be referred back to the Board for redetermination by a different panel.\nBackground",
    "[3]\nThe applicant was born in Guyana in 1958. She married her husband in 1980. The marriage began well and the couple had two children. Eventually, however, her husband joined a criminal gang and began drinking heavily.",
    "[4]\nThe applicant's husband became physically violent, punching and kicking her and using weapons. He beat her in front of their children. She became a slave in her own house. Once her children left home, she was left alone with her alcoholic abuser.",
    "[5]\nThe applicant repeatedly reported the abuse to the Guyanese police, but they only warned the husband and refused to get involved in domestic matters. The abuse continued, including strangling and death threats. Her husband was kicked out of the gang and this led to more drinking and bitterness.",
    "[6]\nAs the abuse increased, the applicant decided to file for divorce. Once her husband learned of this plan, he continued to threaten her and he said he kept a loaded gun in order to murder her.",
    "[7]\nThe applicant went into hiding. In June 2007, she was granted a visitor's visa for Canada in order to attend her niece's wedding.",
    "[8]\nThe applicant arrived in Canada on June 28, 2007 and claimed protection on September 9, 2011. She fears if she returns to Guyana, her ex-husband will kill her.\nBoard's Decision",
    "[9]\nThe Board made its decision on February 28, 2012. After summarizing the basis of the applicant's fear and accepting her identity, the Board turned to the issue of state protection.",
    "[10]\nThe Board stated that Guyana was presumed capable of protecting its citizens and it was up to the applicant to rebut that presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the Guyanese authorities would not be forthcoming with serious efforts to protect her.",
    "[11]\nThe Board found that the applicant had not rebutted the presumption. In considering the country conditions documents, the Board found that they were mixed and inconclusive, since some of the text indicated Guyana's domestic violence protection mechanisms were inadequate, while other parts indicated reasonably functional protection was available for women fearing domestic violence.",
    "[12]\nThe Board excerpted the full text of a 2008 response to information request on domestic violence in Guyana (the RIR), as well as the relevant portion of the 2008 United States Department of State human rights report (the DOS report).",
    "[13]\nThe Board also noted that the state had made efforts to protect the applicant on five occasions, although they were inadequate. The Board indicated it had accepted all the documentary evidence, which pointed to a mixed picture. The Board also noted that the applicant had not made any effort to seek protection in the past several years and that local police failures in themselves do not amount to a general lack of state protection.",
    "[14]\nThe Board stated that home states are not required to provide effective or guaranteed protection, but only need to make serious efforts at protection. Therefore, the Board found that the applicant had not established a clear and convincing case that the state would not be reasonably forthcoming with such efforts. The Board rejected the applicant's claim.\nIssues",
    "[15]\nThe applicant submits the following points at issue:\n1. Was the decision made pursuant to legislation inconsistent with section 7 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n?\n2. Did the Board apply the wrong test for Convention refugee status?\n3. Did the Board violate the principles of natural justice?\n4. Did the Board fail to consider all of the evidence?",
    "[16]\nI would rephrase the issues as follows:\n1. What is the appropriate standard of review?\n2. Did the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\nApplicant's Written Submissions",
    "[17]\nThe applicant argues that sworn testimony is presumed to be true and that her testimony has not been impugned in any way. The documentary evidence indicates there is a well-founded fear of persecution given the backdrop of country conditions in Guyana. The applicant argues she was not given police protection.",
    "[18]\nThe applicant argues the Board overlooked evidence showing the lack of police protection. Any evidence that indicates it is safe for a woman to be in Guyana when a gang member has threatened to kill her is due to media bias. It was unfair for the Board to focus on documents showing Guyana is safe as opposed to the documents of the applicant. The Board also ignored letters from the applicant's daughter indicating that Guyana was unsafe for her.\nRespondent's Written Submissions",
    "[19]\nThe respondent argues that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness.",
    "[20]\nThe respondent argues that it is an accepted principle that the test is not absolute state protection and that even the most effective, well-resourced and highly motivated police forces will have difficulty providing effective protection. The test is whether state protection is adequate. It was up to the Board to weigh the evidence and determine whether there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence that state protection was unavailable.",
    "[21]\nThe respondent argues the Board considered both the negative and positive evidence. The respondent characterizes the applicant's arguments as only pertaining to the weighing of evidence.\nAnalysis and Decision\nIssue 1\nWhat is the appropriate standard of review?",
    "[22]\nWhere previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).",
    "[23]\nAssessments of the adequacy of state protection raise questions of mixed fact and law and is also reviewable against a standard of reasonableness (see\nHinzman, Re\n, 2007 FCA 171, [2007] FCJ No 584 at paragraph 38).",
    "[24]\nIn reviewing the Board's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47;\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).\nIssue 2\nDid the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?",
    "[25]\nThe respondent's position in this proceeding is that the proper test for state protection is whether such protection was adequate.",
    "[26]\nThe Board's decision, however, frequently invokes the \"serious efforts\" of a state to provide protection. This concept is invoked at least ten times in its decision, including in its stating of the test for refugee status:\nAccording to refugee protection law, home states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection: in other words, home states only need to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide\nde facto\neffective or\nde facto\nguaranteed protection.",
    "[27]\nThe use of the phrase \"in other words\" in the passage is incorrect: \"adequate protection\" and \"serious efforts at protection\" are not the same thing. The former is concerned with whether the actual outcome of protection exists in a given country, while the latter merely indicates whether the state has taken steps to provide that protection.",
    "[28]\nIt is of little comfort to a person fearing persecution that a state has made an effort to provide protection if that effort has little effect. For that reason, the Board is tasked with evaluating the empirical reality of the adequacy of state protection.",
    "[29]\nThis Court has affirmed this interpretation of state protection repeatedly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FC No 1589, Mr. Justice Roger Hughes made this clear (at paragraph 8):\nAnother error of law is with respect to what is the nature of state protection that is to be considered. Here the Member found that Mexico \"is making serious and genuine efforts\" to address the problem. That is not the test. What must be considered is the actual effectiveness of the protection.",
    "[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 153, Mr. Justice Michel Beaudry indicated the same principle (at paragraph 10):\nFirst of all, it weighed the evidence of criticisms of the effectiveness of the legislation against evidence on the efforts made to address the problems of domestic violence. This is not enough to ground a finding of state protection; regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavoring to put in place (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215 at paragraph 14).",
    "[31]\nMost recently, Madam Justice Catherine Kane confirmed the same principle in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nThe test is not 'perfect' state protection, but adequate state protection. Still, mere willingness to protect is insufficient; state protection must be effective to a certain degree:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 243 at para. 47.",
    "[32]\nOn this point, therefore, the Board clearly misstated the law. I will still, however, consider whether the Board's consideration of the evidence would have reasonably led to a finding of adequate protection had the Board properly stated the test.",
    "[33]\nThe Board repeatedly described the country conditions documents as \"mixed\" in their conclusions on state protection, since \"some of the text in the most recent documents indicates that Guyana's domestic violence state protection mechanisms are inadequate\" but \"other text in the same recent documents tells a different story and indicates Guyana has reasonably functional state protection mechanisms\".",
    "[34]\nWith all due deference to the Board in its consideration of evidence, I believe that the Board's error in stating the proper legal test for state protection is also reflected in its finding that the evidence is \"mixed\". That is, the country conditions evidence is really a mix of (1) clear statements that state protection is inadequate and (2) descriptions of various efforts made by the Guyanese state.",
    "[35]\nFor example, the RIR includes these statements:\n- domestic violence in Guyana is widespread;\n- at least one out of every three women in Guyana has reportedly been a victim of domestic violence; and\n- some victims are still unaware of their rights and may be too afraid to file a report; when victims do file a complaint, police sometimes offer little support.",
    "[36]\nIt also includes these \"serious efforts\":\n- there are NGOs providing services to victims of domestic violence;\n- there is legislation prohibiting domestic violence;\n- the police receive training on protecting victims; and\n- the government launched a national policy on domestic violence.",
    "[37]\nThe DOS report included these statements:\n- rape is a problem and pervasive in Guyanese society;\n- ineffective police and prosecutors resulted in few charges and fewer convictions;\n- domestic violence and violence against women, including spousal abuse, is widespread and crossed racial and socioeconomic lines;\n- anti-rape legislation was frequently not enforced because of a lack of willingness of victims to press charges.",
    "[38]\nIt also included these \"serious efforts\":\n- spousal rape has been criminalized by a new law;\n- domestic violence is illegal and subject to criminal and civil penalties;\n- the national police force has established domestic violence units;\n- there is a shelter for victims of domestic violence; and\n- sexual harassment is illegal.",
    "[39]\nWhen state protection analysis is properly applied, it is clear that the \"serious efforts\" listed above are not proper evidence of the adequacy of state protection. A law on the books or a training session for police may not lead to the outcome of adequate protection. Evidence of adequacy is that which indicates whether or not a given law actually functions to protect citizens or whether police training has resulted in a real difference in police behaviour.",
    "[40]\nThe Board justified its decision on the basis that the evidence on state protection was mixed, but at no point in its decision did the Board identify any document or statement indicating that the evidence on the adequacy of state protection was mixed. Rather, the Board saw the mixed result being due to evidence of inadequate state protection being counter-balanced by evidence of serious efforts. As I have described above, the latter category of evidence does not speak to the proper test for state protection. Therefore, even with the best attempt to supplement the Board's reasons, I cannot find them reasonable.",
    "[41]\nIt is also puzzling why the Board referred multiple times to the applicant's failure to seek protection \"in the past several years\", given that the applicant has been in Canada since July 2007.",
    "[42]\nIt is not this Court's role to reweigh evidence and my comments should not be taken as speaking to the weight of any particular piece of evidence. Rather, the issue here is that the Board misunderstood the proper test for state protection and its evidentiary findings were sufficiently tainted by that misunderstanding that I cannot disentangle them.",
    "[43]\nThis decision is unreasonable because it conflicts with the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, value of justification, as its state protection finding is neither reasonably justified by reference to the proper legal test nor by reference to properly considered evidence.",
    "[44]\nIn my view, on the facts of this case, the applicant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.",
    "[45]\nI would therefore grant the application for judicial review and return the matter to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.",
    "[46]\nNeither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.\nJUDGMENT",
    "[47]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\nANNEX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision, determination or order made, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is begun by making an application for leave to the Court.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court of any action - decision, order, question or matter - taken under this Act is subject to the filing of an application for leave.\n96. A refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\na) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Court is seized, under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act), of an application for judicial review of the decision dated February 28, 2012 by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) refused to recognize the applicant as a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, as well as that of a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1)."

Rather, the issue here is that the Board misunderstood the proper test for state protection and its evidentiary findings were sufficiently tainted by that misunderstanding that I cannot disentangle them.\n[43]\nThis decision is unreasonable because it conflicts with the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, value of justification, as its state protection finding is neither reasonably justified by reference to the proper legal test nor by reference to properly considered evidence.\n[44]\nIn my view, on the facts of this case, the applicant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[45]\nI would therefore grant the application for judicial review and return the matter to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\n[46]\nNeither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n[47]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\nANNEX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision, determination or order made, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is commenced by making an application for leave to the Court.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n72. (1) Le contrôle judiciaire par la Cour fédérale de toute mesure - décision, ordonnance, question ou affaire - prise dans le cadre de la présente loi est subordonné au dépôt d'une demande d'autorisation.\n96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques:\na) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays;\nb) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.\n97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée:\na) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture;\nb) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant:\n(i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays,\n(ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas,\n(iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles,\n(iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Cour est saisie, sous le régime du paragraphe 72(1) de la\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27 (la Loi), d'une demande de contrôle judiciaire de la décision en date du 28 février 2012 par laquelle la Section de la protection des réfugiés à la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié (la Commission) a refusé de reconnaître à la demanderesse la qualité de réfugiée au sens de la Convention au titre de l'article 96 de la Loi, ainsi que celle de personne à protéger au titre de son paragraphe 97(1).\n[2]\nLa demanderesse sollicite l'annulation de la décision de la Commission et le renvoi de sa demande d'asile devant cette dernière pour nouvel examen par un tribunal différemment constitué.\nLe contexte\n[3]\nLa demanderesse est née au Guyana en 1958 et s'est mariée en 1980. Au début, elle s'entendait bien avec son mari, avec qui elle a eu deux enfants. Mais il est plus tard entré dans un gang et a commencé à consommer une grande quantité d'alcool.\n[4]\nLe mari de la demanderesse a fini par devenir violent, lui donnant coups de poing et coups de pied et l'agressant avec des armes. Il la battait devant leurs enfants. Elle est ainsi devenue une esclave dans sa propre maison. Une fois que ses enfants eurent quitté le foyer, elle est restée seule avec son mari alcoolique et violent.\n[5]\nLa demanderesse s'est plainte à de multiples reprises des violences dont elle faisait l'objet à la police guyanienne, qui s'est contentée de donner des avertissements au mari, refusant de se mêler de querelles conjugales. La violence a continué, y compris sous forme de strangulation et de menaces de mort. L'alcoolisme et l'agressivité du mari n'ont fait que croître après que son gang l'eut exclu.\n[6]\nDevant l'aggravation des mauvais traitements qu'elle subissait, la demanderesse a décidé de demander le divorce. Quand son mari eut appris son projet, il l'a menacée de plus belle, l'informant qu'il gardait une arme à feu chargée pour la tuer.\n[7]\nLa demanderesse est alors partie se cacher. En juin 2007, elle a obtenu un visa de visiteur pour le Canada afin d'y assister au mariage d'une nièce.\n[8]\nElle est arrivée au Canada le 28 juin 2007 et y a demandé l'asile le 9 septembre 2011. Elle craint que son ex-mari ne la tue si elle retourne au Guyana.\nLa décision de la Commission\n[9]\nLa Commission a rendu sa décision le 28 février 2012. Après avoir récapitulé les motifs de crainte de la demanderesse et avoir reconnu son identité, la Commission a examiné la question de la protection de l'État.\n[10]\nLa Commission a d'abord rappelé que le Guyana était présumé capable de protéger ses citoyens et qu'il incombait à la demanderesse de réfuter cette présomption au moyen d'éléments prouvant de manière claire et convaincante que les autorités guyaniennes ne feraient pas d'efforts sérieux pour la protéger.\n[11]\nLa Commission a conclu que la demanderesse n'avait pas réfuté cette présomption. Elle a estimé que les documents sur la situation au Guyana brossaient un tableau contradictoire et peu concluant, certains passages déclarant insuffisants les mécanismes de protection contre la violence familiale, tandis que selon d'autres, les Guyaniennes en butte à ce type de violence jouissaient d'une protection raisonnablement efficace.\n[12]\nLa Commission a cité le texte intégral d'une réponse à une demande d'information, datée de 2008, sur la violence familiale au Guyana (la RDI), ainsi que le passage applicable du rapport de 2008 du Département d'État américain sur les droits de la personne (le rapport du DOS).\n[13]\nLa Commission a aussi fait observer que l'État guyanien avait tenté à cinq occasions de protéger la demanderesse, mais les mesures prises étaient insuffisantes. Elle a déclaré accepter la totalité de la preuve documentaire, qui donnait une image contradictoire de la situation. Elle a aussi fait remarquer que la demanderesse n'avait fait aucun effort pour obtenir la protection de l'État au cours des dernières années et que les manquements de la police locale ne constituaient pas en soi une insuffisance générale de protection étatique.\n[14]\nLa Commission a posé en principe qu'il n'est pas demandé à l'État d'origine de fournir une protection efficace ou garantie, mais seulement de faire de sérieux efforts de protection. Par conséquent, a-t-elle conclu, la demanderesse n'avait pas prouvé de manière claire et convaincante que l'État ne déploierait pas de tels efforts dans une mesure raisonnable, de sorte qu'il fallait rejeter sa demande d'asile.\nLes questions en litige\n[15]\nLa demanderesse met en litige les questions suivantes:\n1. La décision contrôlée a-t-elle été rendue sous le régime de dispositions légales incompatibles avec l'article 7 de la\nCharte canadienne des droits et libertés?\n2. La Commission a-t-elle appliqué un critère erroné à la détermination de la qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention?\n3. La Commission a-t-elle enfreint les principes de justice naturelle?\n4. La Commission a-t-elle omis de prendre en considération la totalité de la preuve?\n[16]\nJe reformulerais comme suit les questions en litige:\n1. Quelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?\n2. La Commission s'est-elle trompée en rejetant la demande d'asile de la demanderesse?\nLes conclusions écrites de la demanderesse\n[17]\nLa demanderesse fait valoir que les témoignages sous serment sont présumés véridiques et que le sien n'a été aucunement contesté. De plus, la preuve documentaire montre qu'elle craint avec raison d'être persécutée, étant donné les conditions qui règnent au Guyana. La demanderesse soutient que la police ne l'a pas protégée.\n[18]\nSelon la demanderesse, la Commission a passé sous silence les éléments tendant à établir l'absence de protection policière. Tout élément donnant à penser qu'une femme ne court aucun danger au Guyana lorsqu'un membre de gang l'a menacée de mort doit être mis au compte d'un parti pris des médias. La Commission a manqué d'équité en se concentrant sur les documents d'après lesquels le Guyana est un pays sûr au détriment de ceux qu'a produits la demanderesse. Toujours suivant cette dernière, la Commission a en outre omis de prendre en considération des lettres de sa fille montrant qu'elle n'était pas en sécurité au Guyana.\nLes conclusions écrites du défendeur\n[19]\nLe défendeur soutient que la norme de contrôle applicable est celle du caractère raisonnable.\n[20]\nIl est de droit constant, fait valoir le défendeur, que le critère n'est pas l'existence d'une protection absolue de l'État, et l'on s'accorde à reconnaître que même les forces policières les plus efficaces, les plus riches en ressources et les plus motivées auront du mal à offrir une protection effective. Le critère consiste à se demander si la protection de l'État est adéquate. Il appartenait à la Commission d'apprécier la preuve et d'établir si elle contenait suffisamment d'éléments démontrant de manière claire et convaincante que la demanderesse ne disposait pas de la protection de l'État.\n[21]\nLe défendeur fait valoir que la Commission a pris en considération les éléments de preuve aussi bien favorables que défavorables à la demanderesse. Selon lui, les arguments de cette dernière ne se rapportent qu'à l'appréciation de la preuve.\nAnalyse et décision\nPremière question en litige\nQuelle est la norme de contrôle applicable?\n[22]\nLorsque la jurisprudence a déterminé la norme de contrôle applicable à une question particulière portée devant la cour de révision, celle-ci peut l'adopter sans autre examen (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 57).\n[23]\nL'examen de la question de savoir si la protection de l'État est adéquate soulève des questions mixtes de fait et de droit et relève aussi de la norme de contrôle fondée sur le caractère raisonnable (voir\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] ACF no 584, paragraphe 38).\n[24]\nLa Cour, lorsqu'elle contrôle une décision de la Commission selon la norme du caractère raisonnable, ne doit intervenir que si celle-ci a prononcé, à la suite d'un processus manquant de transparence et d'intelligibilité, une conclusion injustifiée qui n'appartient pas aux issues possibles acceptables au regard de la preuve dont elle disposait (voir <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, paragraphe 47;\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , paragraphe 59). Comme la Cour suprême du Canada l'a affirmé dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité, la cour de révision ne peut substituer à la solution retenue celle qui serait à son avis préférable, pas plus qu'il ne lui appartient d'apprécier à nouveau la preuve (paragraphe 59).\nDeuxième question en litige\nLa Commission s'est-elle trompée en rejetant la demande d'asile de la demanderesse?\n[25]\nLe défendeur fait valoir dans la présente instance que le critère applicable à la protection de l'État consiste à se demander si cette protection est adéquate.\n[26]\nCependant, la Commission parle souvent dans sa décision des  sérieux efforts  fournis ou à fournir par les États pour protéger leurs citoyens. Elle y invoque cette notion au moins dix fois, y compris dans sa formulation du critère applicable à la détermination de la qualité de réfugié:\nSelon le droit en matière d'octroi de l'asile, l'État d'origine doit seulement offrir une protection adéquate; il n'a pas à assurer une protection parfaite. En d'autres termes, il doit seulement faire de sérieux efforts pour protéger ses citoyens et n'a pas à assurer une protection effective ou garantie dans les faits.\n[27]\nLa Commission a tort de dire  [e]n d'autres termes  dans ce passage: la  protection adéquate  et les  sérieux efforts pour protéger [les] citoyens  sont deux choses différentes. L'une concerne la question de savoir si la protection est effectivement assurée dans un pays donné, tandis que les autres ne nous renseignent que sur celle de savoir si l'État a pris des mesures afin de garantir cette protection.\n[28]\nC'est une maigre consolation pour la personne qui craint d'être persécutée que son État ait fait des efforts pour la protéger si ceux-ci ne sont pas ou guère suivis d'effet. C'est pourquoi la Commission doit évaluer dans sa réalité empirique le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État.\n[29]\nNotre Cour a avalisé à maintes reprises cette interprétation du critère de la protection de l'État. Monsieur le juge Roger Hughes, par exemple, s'est exprimé sans ambiguïté à ce propos au paragraphe 8 de\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 1589:\nUne autre erreur de droit a trait à la nature de la protection de l'État qui doit être prise en compte. En l'espèce, le commissaire a conclu que le Mexique  fait de sérieux efforts  pour résoudre le problème. Ce n'est pas là le critère. Ce qui doit être pris en compte est l'efficacité réelle de la protection.\n[30]\nMonsieur le juge Michel Beaudry a formulé le même principe au paragraphe 10 de\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] ACF no 153:\nD'abord, [la Commission] a apprécié la preuve concernant les critiques de l'efficacité de la loi au regard de la preuve concernant les mesures prises pour traiter les problèmes de violence conjugale. Cela ne suffit pas à justifier une conclusion d'existence de la protection de l'État; on doit tenir compte de la situation réelle et non de ce que l'État se propose de faire ou a entrepris de mettre en place (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215, au paragraphe 14).\n[31]\nEnfin, Madame la juge Catherine Kane a réitéré ce principe au paragraphe 44 de la toute récente décision\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nLe critère n'est pas une protection de l'État  parfaite , mais adéquate. Là encore, la simple volonté de protéger ne suffit pas; la protection de l'État doit présenter un certain niveau d'efficacité:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 243, au paragraphe 47.\n[32]\nDonc, la Commission a de toute évidence mal défini le critère juridique applicable. J'examinerai néanmoins si son examen de la preuve l'aurait raisonnablement amenée à conclure au caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État dans l'hypothèse où elle aurait donné une définition juste du critère y afférent.\n[33]\nLa Commission qualifie à plusieurs reprises de  contradictoires  les conclusions sur la protection de l'État formulées dans les documents relatifs à la situation guyanienne, puisque  [d]ans certaines parties des documents les plus récents, il est indiqué que les mécanismes de protection en matière de violence conjugale au Guyana sont inadéquats , alors que  d'autres parties des mêmes documents montrent une situation différente, où le pays est doté de mécanismes de protection raisonnablement fonctionnels .\n[34]\nMême en exerçant toute la retenue que commandent les résultats de l'examen de la preuve par la Commission, j'estime que son erreur dans l'énonciation du critère juridique applicable à la protection de l'État se retrouve dans sa conclusion selon laquelle la preuve est  contradictoire . En fait, la preuve concernant la situation au Guyana se compose de deux catégories d'éléments: 1) des passages déclarant sans ambiguïté que la protection de l'État est inadéquate, et 2) la description de divers efforts déployés par l'État guyanien.\n[35]\nPar exemple, la RDI comprend les affirmations suivantes:\n- la violence familiale est très répandue au Guyana;\n- au moins une femme sur trois y en aurait été victime;\n- certaines victimes sont encore ignorantes de leurs droits et pourraient avoir trop peur pour porter plainte; et la police n'offre parfois que peu de secours à celles qui portent plainte malgré tout.\n[36]\nLa RDI énumère également les  sérieux efforts  suivants:\n- il y a des ONG qui offrent des services aux victimes de violence familiale;\n- il existe des dispositions légales interdisant ce type de violence;\n- les policiers reçoivent une formation concernant la protection des victimes;\n- le gouvernement a institué une politique nationale de lutte contre la violence familiale.\n[37]\nLe rapport du DOS comprend quant à lui les affirmations qui suivent:\n- le viol est un mal très répandu dans la société guyanienne;\n- l'inefficacité de la police et du ministère public se traduit par la rareté des inculpations et celle, plus grande encore, des déclarations de culpabilité;\n- la violence familiale et la violence contre les femmes, notamment la violence conjugale, sont générales et ne font pas acception des races ni des catégories socioéconomiques;\n- la législation contre le viol reste souvent lettre morte en raison du peu d'empressement des victimes à engager des poursuites.\n[38]\nCe rapport fait aussi état de  sérieux efforts :\n- une nouvelle loi criminalise le viol conjugal;\n- la violence familiale est illégale, et ses auteurs encourent des sanctions pénales et civiles;\n- la police nationale a créé des unités d'intervention contre la violence familiale;\n- il existe un refuge pour les victimes de ce genre de violence;\n- le harcèlement sexuel est aussi illégal.\n[39]\nIl est évident, si on analyse la protection de l'État suivant le critère voulu, que les  sérieux efforts  énumérés plus haut ne suffisent pas établir le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État. Une loi inscrite au code ou un cours de formation pour les policiers n'ont pas nécessairement pour effet la garantie d'une protection adéquate. Les éléments de preuve qui concernent vraiment le caractère adéquat de la protection de l'État sont ceux qui permettent de répondre aux questions de savoir si une loi donnée est effectivement appliquée de manière à protéger les citoyens ou si la formation reçue par les policiers a entraîné un changement réel de leur comportement.\n[40]\nLa Commission justifie sa décision en invoquant la nature contradictoire de la preuve relative à la protection de l'État, mais elle ne cite dans ses motifs aucun document ou passage de document qui révélerait des contradictions dans la preuve concernant le caractère adéquat de cette protection. La Commission attribue plutôt la nature contradictoire de la preuve au fait que les éléments de celle-ci tendant à établir la mise en uvre d'efforts sérieux lui paraissent contrebalancer ceux qui tendent à établir le caractère inadéquat de la protection de l'État. Or, comme je l'expliquais plus haut, la première catégorie de ces éléments est dénuée de pertinence selon le critère qui doit être appliqué à l'évaluation de la protection offerte par l'État. Par conséquent, même en faisant de mon mieux pour suppléer les motifs de la Commission, je ne puis les déclarer raisonnables.\n[41]\nEn outre, il paraît étrange que la Commission invoque à maintes reprises le fait que la demanderesse se soit abstenue de demander la protection de l'État  au cours des dernières années , alors qu'elle habite au Canada depuis juillet 2007.\n[42]\nIl n'appartient pas à notre Cour d'apprécier de nouveau la preuve, et le lecteur ne devrait interpréter aucune de mes observations comme portant sur le poids à attribuer à un élément de preuve déterminé, quel qu'il soit. J'essaie plutôt de montrer ici que la Commission a mal compris le critère applicable à l'évaluation de la protection de l'État et que ses conclusions relatives à la preuve sont viciées par cette erreur au point qu'il ne m'est pas possible de les considérer indépendamment d'elle.\n[43]\nLa décision contrôlée est déraisonnable au motif qu'elle ne remplit pas l'exigence de justification formulée dans <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , précité; en effet, la conclusion de la Commission touchant la protection de l'État ne se justifie raisonnablement ni par l'application du critère juridique voulu ni par l'examen de la preuve sous l'angle nécessaire.\n[44]\nÉtant donné les faits de l'espèce, la demanderesse me paraît avoir réfuté la présomption de protection de l'État.\n[45]\nEn conséquence, je suis d'avis d'accueillir la présente demande de contrôle judiciaire et de renvoyer l'affaire devant la Commission pour nouvel examen par un tribunal différemment constitué.\n[46]\nAucune des parties n'a proposé de question grave de portée générale à la certification.\nJUGEMENT\n[47]\nLA COUR STATUE COMME SUIT:\nLa demande de contrôle judiciaire est accueillie, la décision de la Commission est annulée, et l'affaire est renvoyée devant la Commission pour nouvel examen par un tribunal différemment constitué.\nANNEXE\nLes dispositions légales applicables\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés\n, LC 2001, c 27\n72.

Pentney, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, for the respondent.\nSummary:\nThis case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. Any footnotes found in this case will appear below end of document.\n\n[1]\nO'Keefe, J.\n: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act) for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the Board), dated February 28, 2012, wherein the applicant was determined to be neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in subsection 97(1) of the Act.\n\n[2]\nThe applicant requests that the Board's decision be set aside and the application be referred back to the Board for redetermination by a different panel.\nBackground\n\n[3]\nThe applicant was born in Guyana in 1958. She married her husband in 1980. The marriage began well and the couple had two children. Eventually, however, her husband joined a criminal gang and began drinking heavily.\n\n[4]\nThe applicant's husband became physically violent, punching and kicking her and using weapons. He beat her in front of their children. She became a slave in her own house. Once her children left home, she was left alone with her alcoholic abuser.\n\n[5]\nThe applicant repeatedly reported the abuse to the Guyanese police, but they only warned the husband and refused to get involved in domestic matters. The abuse continued, including strangling and death threats. Her husband was kicked out of the gang and this led to more drinking and bitterness.\n\n[6]\nAs the abuse increased, the applicant decided to file for divorce. Once her husband learned of this plan, he continued to threaten her and he said he kept a loaded gun in order to murder her.\n\n[7]\nThe applicant went into hiding. In June 2007, she was granted a visitor's visa for Canada in order to attend her niece's wedding.\n\n[8]\nThe applicant arrived in Canada on June 28, 2007 and claimed protection on September 9, 2011. She fears if she returns to Guyana, her ex-husband will kill her.\nBoard's Decision\n\n[9]\nThe Board made its decision on February 28, 2012. After summarizing the basis of the applicant's fear and accepting her identity, the Board turned to the issue of state protection.\n\n[10]\nThe Board stated that Guyana was presumed capable of protecting its citizens and it was up to the applicant to rebut that presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the Guyanese authorities would not be forthcoming with serious efforts to protect her.\n\n[11]\nThe Board found that the applicant had not rebutted the presumption. In considering the country conditions documents, the Board found that they were mixed and inconclusive, since some of the text indicated Guyana's domestic violence protection mechanisms were inadequate, while other parts indicated reasonably functional protection was available for women fearing domestic violence.\n\n[12]\nThe Board excerpted the full text of a 2008 response to information request on domestic violence in Guyana (the RIR), as well as the relevant portion of the 2008 United States Department of State human rights report (the DOS report).\n\n[13]\nThe Board also noted that the state had made efforts to protect the applicant on five occasions, although they were inadequate. The Board indicated it had accepted all the documentary evidence, which pointed to a mixed picture. The Board also noted that the applicant had not made any effort to seek protection in the past several years and that local police failures in themselves do not amount to a general lack of state protection.\n\n[14]\nThe Board stated that home states are not required to provide effective or guaranteed protection, but only need to make serious efforts at protection. Therefore, the Board found that the applicant had not established a clear and convincing case that the state would not be reasonably forthcoming with such efforts. The Board rejected the applicant's claim.\nIssues\n\n[15]\nThe applicant submits the following points at issue:\n1. Was the decision made pursuant to legislation inconsistent with section 7 of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n?\n2. Did the Board apply the wrong test for Convention refugee status?\n3. Did the Board violate the principles of natural justice?\n4. Did the Board fail to consider all of the evidence?\n\n[16]\nI would rephrase the issues as follows:\n1. What is the appropriate standard of review?\n2. Did the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\nApplicant's Written Submissions\n\n[17]\nThe applicant argues that sworn testimony is presumed to be true and that her testimony has not been impugned in any way. The documentary evidence indicates there is a well-founded fear of persecution given the backdrop of country conditions in Guyana. The applicant argues she was not given police protection.\n\n[18]\nThe applicant argues the Board overlooked evidence showing the lack of police protection. Any evidence that indicates it is safe for a woman to be in Guyana when a gang member has threatened to kill her is due to media bias. It was unfair for the Board to focus on documents showing Guyana is safe as opposed to the documents of the applicant. The Board also ignored letters from the applicant's daughter indicating that Guyana was unsafe for her.\nRespondent's Written Submissions\n\n[19]\nThe respondent argues that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness.\n\n[20]\nThe respondent argues that it is an accepted principle that the test is not absolute state protection and that even the most effective, well-resourced and highly motivated police forces will have difficulty providing effective protection. The test is whether state protection is adequate. It was up to the Board to weigh the evidence and determine whether there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence that state protection was unavailable.\n\n[21]\nThe respondent argues the Board considered both the negative and positive evidence. The respondent characterizes the applicant's arguments as only pertaining to the weighing of evidence.\nAnalysis and Decision\nIssue 1\nWhat is the appropriate standard of review?\n\n[22]\nWhere previous jurisprudence has determined the standard of review applicable to a particular issue before the court, the reviewing court may adopt that standard (see\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 57).\n\n[23]\nAssessments of the adequacy of state protection raise questions of mixed fact and law and is also reviewable against a standard of reasonableness (see\nHinzman, Re\n, 2007 FCA 171, [2007] FCJ No 584 at paragraph 38).\n\n[24]\nIn reviewing the Board's decision on the standard of reasonableness, the Court should not intervene unless the Board came to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, at paragraph 47;\nCanada (Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at paragraph 59). As the Supreme Court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, it is not up to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome, nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (at paragraph 59).\nIssue 2\nDid the Board err in rejecting the applicant's claim?\n\n[25]\nThe respondent's position in this proceeding is that the proper test for state protection is whether such protection was adequate.\n\n[26]\nThe Board's decision, however, frequently invokes the \"serious efforts\" of a state to provide protection. This concept is invoked at least ten times in its decision, including in its stating of the test for refugee status:\nAccording to refugee protection law, home states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection: in other words, home states only need to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide\nde facto\neffective or\nde facto\nguaranteed protection.\n\n[27]\nThe use of the phrase \"in other words\" in the passage is incorrect: \"adequate protection\" and \"serious efforts at protection\" are not the same thing. The former is concerned with whether the actual outcome of protection exists in a given country, while the latter merely indicates whether the state has taken steps to provide that protection.\n\n[28]\nIt is of little comfort to a person fearing persecution that a state has made an effort to provide protection if that effort has little effect. For that reason, the Board is tasked with evaluating the empirical reality of the adequacy of state protection.\n\n[29]\nThis Court has affirmed this interpretation of state protection repeatedly.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FC No 1589, Mr. Justice Roger Hughes made this clear (at paragraph 8):\nAnother error of law is with respect to what is the nature of state protection that is to be considered. Here the Member found that Mexico \"is making serious and genuine efforts\" to address the problem. That is not the test. What must be considered is the actual effectiveness of the protection.\n\n[30]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2010] FCJ No 153, Mr. Justice Michel Beaudry indicated the same principle (at paragraph 10):\nFirst of all, it weighed the evidence of criticisms of the effectiveness of the legislation against evidence on the efforts made to address the problems of domestic violence. This is not enough to ground a finding of state protection; regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavoring to put in place (\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R. (3d) 215 at paragraph 14).\n\n[31]\nMost recently, Madam Justice Catherine Kane confirmed the same principle in\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\nThe test is not 'perfect' state protection, but adequate state protection. Still, mere willingness to protect is insufficient; state protection must be effective to a certain degree:\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm LR (3d) 243 at para. 47.\n\n[32]\nOn this point, therefore, the Board clearly misstated the law. I will still, however, consider whether the Board's consideration of the evidence would have reasonably led to a finding of adequate protection had the Board properly stated the test.\n\n[33]\nThe Board repeatedly described the country conditions documents as \"mixed\" in their conclusions on state protection, since \"some of the text in the most recent documents indicates that Guyana's domestic violence state protection mechanisms are inadequate\" but \"other text in the same recent documents tells a different story and indicates Guyana has reasonably functional state protection mechanisms\".\n\n[34]\nWith all due deference to the Board in its consideration of evidence, I believe that the Board's error in stating the proper legal test for state protection is also reflected in its finding that the evidence is \"mixed\". That is, the country conditions evidence is really a mix of (1) clear statements that state protection is inadequate and (2) descriptions of various efforts made by the Guyanese state.\n\n[35]\nFor example, the RIR includes these statements:\n- domestic violence in Guyana is widespread;\n- at least one out of every three women in Guyana has reportedly been a victim of domestic violence; and\n- some victims are still unaware of their rights and may be too afraid to file a report; when victims do file a complaint, police sometimes offer little support.\n\n[36]\nIt also includes these \"serious efforts\":\n- there are NGOs providing services to victims of domestic violence;\n- there is legislation prohibiting domestic violence;\n- the police receive training on protecting victims; and\n- the government launched a national policy on domestic violence.\n\n[37]\nThe DOS report included these statements:\n- rape is a problem and pervasive in Guyanese society;\n- ineffective police and prosecutors resulted in few charges and fewer convictions;\n- domestic violence and violence against women, including spousal abuse, is widespread and crossed racial and socioeconomic lines;\n- anti-rape legislation was frequently not enforced because of a lack of willingness of victims to press charges.\n\n[38]\nIt also included these \"serious efforts\":\n- spousal rape has been criminalized by a new law;\n- domestic violence is illegal and subject to criminal and civil penalties;\n- the national police force has established domestic violence units;\n- there is a shelter for victims of domestic violence; and\n- sexual harassment is illegal.\n\n[39]\nWhen state protection analysis is properly applied, it is clear that the \"serious efforts\" listed above are not proper evidence of the adequacy of state protection. A law on the books or a training session for police may not lead to the outcome of adequate protection. Evidence of adequacy is that which indicates whether or not a given law actually functions to protect citizens or whether police training has resulted in a real difference in police behaviour.\n\n[40]\nThe Board justified its decision on the basis that the evidence on state protection was mixed, but at no point in its decision did the Board identify any document or statement indicating that the evidence on the adequacy of state protection was mixed. Rather, the Board saw the mixed result being due to evidence of inadequate state protection being counter-balanced by evidence of serious efforts. As I have described above, the latter category of evidence does not speak to the proper test for state protection. Therefore, even with the best attempt to supplement the Board's reasons, I cannot find them reasonable.\n\n[41]\nIt is also puzzling why the Board referred multiple times to the applicant's failure to seek protection \"in the past several years\", given that the applicant has been in Canada since July 2007.\n\n[42]\nIt is not this Court's role to reweigh evidence and my comments should not be taken as speaking to the weight of any particular piece of evidence. Rather, the issue here is that the Board misunderstood the proper test for state protection and its evidentiary findings were sufficiently tainted by that misunderstanding that I cannot disentangle them.\n\n[43]\nThis decision is unreasonable because it conflicts with the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> above, value of justification, as its state protection finding is neither reasonably justified by reference to the proper legal test nor by reference to properly considered evidence.\n\n[44]\nIn my view, on the facts of this case, the applicant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n\n[45]\nI would therefore grant the application for judicial review and return the matter to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\n\n[46]\nNeither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.\nJUDGMENT\n\n[47]\nTHIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that\nthe application for judicial review is allowed, the decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.\nANNEX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision, determination or order made, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is begun by making an application for leave to the Court.\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries; gold\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose withdrawal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; gold\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n72. (1) Judicial review by the Federal Court of any action - decision, order, question or matter - taken under this Act is subject to the filing of an application for leave.\n96. A refugee within the meaning of the Convention - the refugee - is the person who, having a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of his race, his religion, his nationality, his membership in a social group or his political opinions:\na) either is outside any country of which he or she is a national and cannot or, because of this fear, does not want to claim the protection of each of these countries;\nb) or, if he does not have a nationality and is outside the country in which he had his habitual residence, cannot and, because of this fear, does not want to return there.\n97. (1) A person to be protected is a person who is in Canada and would be personally, by his removal to any country of which he is a national or, if he has no nationality, in which he had his habitual residence, exposed:\n(a) or at risk, if there are serious grounds for believing so, of being subjected to torture within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention against Torture;\n(b) a threat to his life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the following case:\n(i) it cannot or, therefore, does not want to claim the protection of this country,\n(ii) he is exposed to it in any place in that country whereas other persons originating from that country or who are there are generally not,\n(iii) the threat or risk does not result from legitimate sanctions - except those imposed in disregard of international standards - and is not inherent in them or occasioned by them,\n(iv) the threat or risk does not result from the country's inability to provide adequate medical or health care.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> Court is seized, under subsection 72(1) of the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n, SC 2001, c 27 (the Act), of an application for judicial review of the decision dated February 28, 2012 by which the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) refused to recognize the applicant as a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, as well as that of a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1).",
