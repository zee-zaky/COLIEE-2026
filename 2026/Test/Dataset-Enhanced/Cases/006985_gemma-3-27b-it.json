    "[1]\nJustice Shore\n: The Court established that removal officers have limited discretion, which is limited to postponing removal\ndue to special or compelling circumstances\n. [37] It is well established in law that the discretionary power to defer a removal order is very limited. It would be contrary to the purposes and objectives of the Act to extend, by judicial declaration, the limited discretion of the removal officer to require a \"mini\" H&C review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> para. 2003 FC 1430; See also: <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> par. 12 (<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2002] F.C.A. no. 1133, para. 21 (QL); Prasad Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 CFPI 614, [2003] F.A.C. no. 805, para. 32 (<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [2006] F.C.A. no. 182, para. 26 (QL).)",
    "[2]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that she had submitted evidence to the removals officer that could constitute sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to deferring a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n: [45] The order whose deferral is in issue is a mandatory order which the Minister is bound by law to execute.\nThe exercise of deferral requires justification for failing to obey a positive obligation imposed by statute\n. That justification must be found in the statute or in some other legal obligation imposed on the Minister which is of sufficient importance to relieve the Minister from compliance with section 48 of the Act [Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1-2]. (Emphasis added.)\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 295, paragraph 45 (QL))\nINTRODUCTION",
    "[3]\nThe applicant, a Mexican citizen, has brought a motion to stay the removal order against her. The motion is attached to an application for leave and judicial review (ALJR) of the removals officer's refusal to defer her removal.",
    "[4]\nA motion for a stay of the removal order was also filed in docket IMM-2603-07, attached to an ALJR of the negative decision dated on May 17, 2007, on the applicant's application for a pre-removal risk assessment.\nFACTS",
    "[5]\nThe applicant is a Mexican citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada on June 22, 2004 (page 2, \"Risks identified by the Applicant\", Notes to file Pre-removal Risk Assessment, (PRRA Reasons), Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).",
    "[6]\nThe applicant alleges that she is afraid in her country because of her homosexuality. (See the Reasons for Decision issued January 6, 2005, by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), Exhibit E to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)",
    "[7]\nThe RPD of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) heard the refugee claim on January 6, 2005, and refused it because the applicant lacked credibility. The applicant did not file an ALJR of that decision.",
    "[8]\nThe applicant applied for a pre-removal risk assessment on February 25, 2007 (application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA Application), Exhibit F to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé). A negative decision was issued on May 17, 2007 (PRRA Reasons, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).",
    "[9]\nThe applicant is currently in a common-law relationship with a man, according to the affidavits of the applicant and her spouse, and applied for permanent residence as a spouse in Canada on February 9, 2007.",
    "[10]\nThe negative decision on the PRRA application was sent to the applicant on June 9, 2007. An ALJR of that decision was filed on June 28, 2007, in docket IMM-2603-07. (See \"Notice of Interview for June 9, 2007\", Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé and after \"Officer's Notes dated June 9, 2007\", Exhibit B to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)",
    "[11]\nAt the meeting on June 9, 2007, the applicant received a letter telling her that she had to go to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) no later than July 4, 2007, in possession of a plane ticket with a departure date of July 13, 2007, or earlier.",
    "[12]\nThe applicant\nfailed to appear on July 4, 2007\n, and the CBSA issued an arrest warrant against the applicant. Because the applicant had not shown up, no departure date could be set. (See the note to file signed by Éric Gagnon, dated 05-07-2007, Exhibit L to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)",
    "[13]\nOn July 4, 2007, the applicant served and filed motions for stays of the removal order in this docket and in docket IMM-2603-07.",
    "[14]\nOn July 6, 2007, the applicant finally went to the CBSA offices and since she had in her possession a plane ticket for July 13, 2007, the departure date was scheduled for July 13, 2007. (See the \"Officer's Notes\", dated July 6, 2007, Exhibit G to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé and the confirmation of the departure date of July 13, 2007, dated July 6, 2007, Exhibit H to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\nANALYSIS",
    "[15]\nIn order to assess the merits of the stay motion, this Court must determine whether the applicant meets the tests delineated by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).",
    "[16]\nIn that case, the Federal Court of Appeal adopted three tests that it imported from the case law on injunctions, specifically the Supreme Court of Canada decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The three tests are\n(1) serious issue;\n(2) irreparable harm; and\n(3) assessment of the balance of convenience.",
    "[17]\nAll three tests must be met for this Court to grant the stay. If one of them is not satisfied, the Court cannot grant the stay.",
    "[18]\nIn this case, the applicant has not demonstrated that there is a serious issue to be tried on the ALJR of the officer's decision on the application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; she has not established irreparable harm and, last, the inconvenience to the applicant is not superior to the public interest in having the removal order enforced as soon as is practicable in accordance with paragraph 48(2) of the IRPA.\nSERIOUS ISSUE",
    "[19]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried by this Court.",
    "[20]\nThe applicant must show that she has a reasonable chance of succeeding on her main application, i.e., the ALJR of the officer's decision.\nLIMITED DISCRETION OF REMOVALS OFFICER",
    "[21]\nThe Court has established that removals officers have limited discretion to defer a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n. [37] It is well-established law that the discretion to defer a removal is very limited. It would be contrary to the purposes and objects to the Act to expand, by judicial declaration, a removal officer's limited discretion so as to mandate a \"mini H&C\" review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 4 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Griffith, above.)",
    "[22]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that she had submitted evidence to the removals officer that could constitute sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to deferring a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n: [45] The order whose deferral is in issue is a mandatory order which the Minister is bound by law to execute.\nThe exercise of deferral requires justification for failing to obey a positive obligation imposed by statute.\nThat justification must be found in the statute or in some other legal obligation imposed on the Minister which is of sufficient importance to relieve the Minister from compliance with section 48 of the Act [Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1-2]. (Emphasis added.)\n(Wang, above)",
    "[23]\nThe applicant simply states in her affidavit that the officer [translation] \"refused to stay the removal despite the fact that I told him about the ongoing sponsorship proceedings\" (paragraph 16, Affidavit of the Applicant, page 12 of the Motion Record).",
    "[24]\nIt is settled law that a pending sponsorship application is not per se an obstacle to removal. [52] Turning to the issue in the underlying judicial review, the Removal Officer's refusal to defer the removal pending the disposition of the H & C application, I find no serious issue with regard to the Removal Officer's conduct. As set out above, a pending H & C application on grounds of family separation is not itself grounds for delaying a removal. To treat it as such would be to create a statutory stay which Parliament declined to enact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, per Noël J. (as he then was).\n(Wang, above; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphs 17 to 19 (T.D.) (QL).)",
    "[25]\nThe applicant clearly did not submit any evidence that could constitute justification for the removals officer to defer the removal.",
    "[26]\nConsidering all of the foregoing, the applicant failed to raise a serious issue in support of her motion. The motion for a stay of removal could be dismissed on this ground alone.\nTHE APPLICANT NOT ENTITLED TO ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERRAL",
    "[27]\nThe applicant was invited by letter dated January 22, 2007, to meet with an IRPA enforcement officer on February 10, 2007, to bring her file up-to-date for a possible removal from Canada (interview letter for pre-removal interview, dated January 22, 2007, Exhibit I to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).",
    "[28]\nIt was only after receiving the letter that the applicant submitted an application for permanent residence as a spouse in Canada. In fact, the application was filed on February 9, 2007.",
    "[29]\nThe applicant could only have benefited from the policy if her sponsorship application had been submitted before she was invited to an interview:\nWhen is a client removal ready?\nFor the purposes of this public policy, by the time an applicant attends a pre-removal interview, he/she is generally removal ready.\nThis means that a client who has been called to a pre-removal interview by any means (letter, call etc.) and who has not already applied as a spousal H&C applicant or a Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada class applicant, cannot, from the point they are called to the interview forward, benefit from an administrative deferral of removal as outlined in this public policy\nexcept in the limited circumstances outlined below (transitional cases). (Emphasis added.)\n(page 60, \"F. ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERRAL OF REMOVAL\", Appendix HPublic Policy Under 25(1) of IRPA to Facilitate Processing in accordance with the Regulations of the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class, Manual IP8: Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class, Exhibit J to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé)",
    "[30]\nThe applicant was, therefore, not eligible for the policy since her application was submitted after she had been invited to the pre-removal interview. Moreover, the administrative deferral lasts for 60 days and, if it had been applicable, would have expired by now.\nIRREPARABLE HARM",
    "[31]\nThe Court defined irreparable harm in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 15 (QL) (T.D.) as\nreturning a person to a country where his safety or his life is in jeopardy\n.",
    "[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 22 (QL), Madam Justice Sandra J. Simpson stated the following about the definition of irreparable harm in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [22]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, for the purposes of a stay application,\nirreparable harm implies the serious likelihood of jeopardy to an applicant's life or safety. This is a very strict test\nand I accept its premise that\nirreparable harm must be very grave and more than the unfortunate hardship\nassociated with the breakup or relocation of a family. (Emphasis added.)",
    "[33]\nThe applicant repeats in part what she already stated in the refugee claim and the PRRA application about her alleged homosexuality while she was living in Mexico.",
    "[34]\nThe RPD denied the applicant's refugee claim on January 6, 2005, and concluded that it did not believe the applicant's allegations. The applicant did not file an ALJR of that decision (RPD Reasons, Exhibit E to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).",
    "[35]\nOn the other hand, the risks identified by the applicant on her PRRA application are based on allegations about her homosexuality when she was living in Mexico. She does not want to return to Mexico and relive what she endured.",
    "[36]\nThe PRRA officer found that the applicant would not be at risk should she return to Mexico (PRRA Reasons, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).",
    "[37]\nThe applicant explained that she now realizes that she was not really homosexual but that she acted that way to show that she was eccentric. Besides, she is now openly, and with her family's knowledge, in a relationship with a man.",
    "[38]\nOn a motion for a stay of a removal order, an applicant cannot allege the same risks that were dismissed at the RPD and PRRA stages. [2] . . . Moreover, his allegations on that point are substantially the same as the ones raised when his claim was before the Immigration and Refugee Board. His allegations then assessed and dismissed because they were not crediblecannot be the basis of an allegation of irreparable harm (see, for example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2003 FC 931).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1172 (QL))",
    "[39]\nIn support of her stay motion, the applicant also states that her spouse is a Muslim, that his parents have disowned him and that she fears for her [translation] \"future, reputation and safety\" if returned to Mexico (paragraphs 28 and 30, Affidavit of the Applicant, page 13 of the Motion Record).",
    "[40]\nThese allegations of the applicant are vague and provide no details about the irreparable harm she would suffer if returned to Mexico. It is not clear whether the risks would stem from the fact that her spouse is a Muslim or whether they are connected to her homosexuality allegations.",
    "[41]\nFor these reasons, the alleged harm is purely speculative: [7] Second, irreparable harm must not be speculative nor can it be based on a series of possibilities. The Court must be satisfied that the irreparable harm will occur if the relief sought is not granted: Atakora, supra, at para. 12;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2001 FCT 325 at para. 15).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1182 (QL))\nAPPLICANT'S SPOUSE",
    "[42]\nThe applicant's spouse states in his affidavit that he could not go to live with the applicant in Mexico because his family has disowned them.",
    "[43]\nHe also relies on the financial commitments that he and the applicant have entered into together and states that it would be impossible to pay these debts on his own.",
    "[44]\nThe problems raised by the applicant's spouse are the normal consequences of removal. In addition, no details or evidence about these commitments were provided.",
    "[45]\nMoreover, no details about the relationship were submitted to the Court.",
    "[46]\nIt is settled law that family separation per se is not irreparable harm because it is within the normal consequences of removal. [3] Second, family separation per se is not irreparable harm because it is within the normal consequences of deportation (see, i.e.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). There is nothing about the applicant's case which takes it beyond the usual result of deportation.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 1679, paragraph 3 (QL); See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1161, paragraph 10 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 24 (QL).)",
    "[47]\nSeparation from a spouse is not the type of harm referred to in the tripartite test to obtain a stay. As stated by Mr. Justice Denis Pelletier in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL): [21] These are all unpleasant and distasteful consequences of deportation. But if the phrase irreparable harm is to retain any meaning at all, it must refer to some prejudice beyond that which is inherent in the notion of deportation itself. To be deported is to lose your job, to be separated from familiar faces and places. It is accompanied by enforced separation and heartbreak. There is nothing in Mr. Melo's circumstances which takes it out of the usual consequences of deportation.",
    "[48]\nUltimately, the applicant and her spouse were aware of her precarious status when they took on the financial commitments, which were, moreover, not in evidence before the Court, and they made their decisions with full knowledge of the situation. In the words of Mr. Justice Paul Rouleau, they did so at their peril: [16] I see no transgressions in the conduct of the Minister; no expectations granted the applicant; if he chose to marry while still not having his situation favourably determined by Canadian authorities, it is at his peril, not that of the Minister who has a duty to uphold the laws of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL))",
    "[49]\nConsequently, absent a serious issue to be tried by this Court, the applicant has not demonstrated irreparable harm.\nBALANCE OF CONVENIENCE",
    "[50]\nIn addition to demonstrating that the underlying ALJR raises a serious issue to be tried and that he or she will suffer irreparable harm if the removal is not stayed, the person requesting a stay must establish that, having regard to all the circumstances, the balance of convenience favours granting the stay ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).",
    "[51]\nIn determining the balance of convenience, the Court must decide which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the grant or refusal of the stay ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 2 (QL)).",
    "[52]\nIn the absence of serious questions and irreparable harm, the balance of convenience favors the Minister, who has an interest in the referral order being executed on the date he sets. (<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> par. 2 (QL).)",
    "[53]\nSubsection 48(2) of the Act provides that a removal order must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n48 (1)\nEnforceable Removal Order -\nA removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.\n48(2)\nEffect -\nIf a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.",
    "[54]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 18 (QL), Madam Justice Barbara Reed elaborated on the issue of balance of convenience on stay motions and the public interest that must be taken into consideration: [18] What is in issue, however, when considering balance of convenience, is the extent to which the granting of stays might become a practice which thwarts the efficient operation of the immigration legislation. It is well known that the present procedures were put in place because a practice had grown up in which many many cases, totally devoid of merit, were initiated in the court, indeed were clogging the court, for the sole purpose of buying the appellants further time in Canada. There is a public interest in having a system which operates in an efficient, expeditious and fair manner and which, to the greatest extent possible, does not lend itself to abusive practices. This is the public interest which in my view must be weighed against the potential harm to the applicant if a stay is not granted.",
    "[55]\nThe balance of convenience favours the Minister.\nCONCLUSION",
    "[56]\nFor all these reasons, the motion for a stay of the removal order is dismissed.",
    "[57]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande de sursis d'exécution de la mesure de renvoi soit rejetée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Court has established that removals officers have limited discretion to defer a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n.

Il serait contraire aux buts et objectifs de la Loi d'étendre, au moyen d'une déclaration judiciaire, le pouvoir discrétionnaire restreint que possède l'agent chargé du renvoi, de façon à exiger un \"mini\" examen des raisons d'ordre humanitaire avant le renvoi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 4 (1re inst.)

Cette justification doit se trouver dans la loi, ou dans une autre obligation juridique que le ministre doit respecter et qui est suffisamment importante pour l'autoriser à ne pas respecter l'article 48 de la Loi [sur l'immigration, L.R.C. (1985), ch. I-2]. (La Cour souligne.)\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] A.C.F. no 295, par. 45 (QL).)\nINTRODUCTION\n[3]\nLa demanderesse, citoyenne du Mexique, présente une requête en sursis d'exécution de la mesure de renvoi prise à son encontre. Cette requête est rattachée à une demande d'autorisation et de contrôle judiciaire (DACJ) à l'encontre du refus de l'agent de renvoi de reporter son renvoi.\n[4]\nUne requête en sursis d'exécution de la mesure de renvoi a aussi été déposée dans le dossier IMM-2603-07, rattachée à une DACJ à l'encontre de la décision négative rendu le 17 mai 2007 dans la demande d'évaluation des risques avant renvoi de la demanderesse.\nFAITS\n[5]\nLa demanderesse est citoyenne du Mexique et a demandé l'asile au Canada le 22 juin 2004. (Page 2, \"Risks identified by the Applicant\", Notes to file  Pre-removal Risk Assessment, (Motifs ERAR), pièce \"D\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[6]\nLa demanderesse alléguait craindre dans son pays en raison de son homosexualité. (Voir les \"Motifs\" de la décision rendue le 6 janvier 2005 par la Section de protection des réfugiés (SPR), pièce \"E\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[7]\nLa demande d'asile a été entendue par la SPR de la Commission de l'Immigration et du Statut de Réfugié (CISR) qui a rejeté sa demande, en raison de l'absence de crédibilité de la demanderesse, le 6 janvier 2005. La demanderesse n'a pas déposé de DACJ à l'encontre de cette décision.\n[8]\nLa demanderesse a présenté une demande d'évaluation des risques avant renvoi le 25 février 2007. (Application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (Demande ERAR), pièce \"F\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.) Une décision négative a été rendue le 17 mai 2007. (Motifs ERAR, pièce \"D\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[9]\nLa demanderesse serait présentement en union de fait avec un homme, tel qu'il appert des affidavits de la demanderesse et de son conjoint, et aurait déposé une demande de résidence permanente à titre de conjoint au Canada, le 9 février 2007.\n[10]\nLa décision négative sur la demande ERAR a été communiquée à la demanderesse le 9 juin 2007. Une DACJ de cette décision a été déposée le 28 juin 2007, dans le dossier IMM-2603-07. (Voir \"Convocation pour le 9 juin 2007\", pièce \"A\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé et après \"Notes de l'agent du 9 juin 2007\", pièce \"B\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[11]\nLors de la rencontre du 9 juin 2007, la demanderesse a reçu une lettre l'informant qu'elle\ndevait se présenter au plus tard le 4 juillet 2007\naux bureaux de l'Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (ASFC) en possession d'un billet d'avion ayant une date de départ au plus tard le 13 juillet 2007.\n[12]\nLa demanderesse\nne s'est pas présentée le 4 juillet 2007\n, et l'ASFC était alors en position d'émettre un mandat d'arrestation à l'encontre de la demanderesse vu son défaut. En raison du défaut de la demanderesse, aucune date de départ n'a pu être fixée. (Voir la note au dossier signée d'Éric Gagnon, datée du 05-07-2007, pièce \"L\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[13]\nLe 4 juillet 2007, la demanderesse a signifié et déposé des requêtes en sursis de l'exécution de la mesure de renvoi dans le dossier présent et le dossier IMM-2603-07.\n[14]\nLe 6 juillet 2007, la demanderesse s'est finalement présentée aux bureaux de l'ASFC et, puisque la demanderesse avait en sa possession un billet d'avion partant le 13 juillet 2007, la date de départ a été fixée au 13 juillet 2007. (Voir les \"Notes de l'agent\", datée du 6 juillet 2007, pièce \"G\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé et la confirmation de date de départ le 13 juillet 2007, datée du 6 juillet 2007, pièce \"H\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\nANALYSE\n[15]\nAfin d'évaluer le bien-fondé de la requête en sursis, la présente Cour doit déterminer si la demanderesse satisfait aux critères jurisprudentiels émis par la Cour d'appel fédérale dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).\n[16]\nDans cette affaire, la Cour d'appel fédérale a retenu trois critères qu'elle a importés de la jurisprudence en matière d'injonction, plus particulièrement de la décision de la Cour suprême du Canada dans l'affaire Manitoba (Procureur général) c. Metropolitan Stores Ltd., [1987] 1 R.C.S. 110. Ces trois critères sont:\n(1) l'existence d'une question sérieuse;\n(2) l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable; et\n(3) l'évaluation de la balance des inconvénients.\n[17]\nLes trois critères doivent être rencontrés afin que cette Cour accorde le sursis demandé. Si un seul d'entre eux n'est pas rencontré, cette Cour ne peut pas accorder le sursis demandé.\n[18]\nEn l'espèce, la demanderesse n'a pas démontré l'existence d'une question sérieuse à être tranchée dans le cadre de sa DACJ à l'encontre de la décision de l'agent sur la demande pour motifs humanitaires, ni l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable et finalement, les inconvénients de la demanderesse ne sont pas supérieurs à ceux de l'intérêt public qui veut que le renvoi soit exécuté dès que les circonstances le permettent en vertu de l'alinéa 48(2) de la LIPR.\nQUESTION SÉRIEUSE\n[19]\nLa demanderesse n'a pas démontré l'existence d'une question sérieuse à être tranchée par cette Cour.\n[20]\nLa demanderesse doit démontrer qu'elle a des chances raisonnables d'avoir gain de cause dans son recours principal, soit sa DACJ à l'encontre de la décision de l'agent.\nPOUVOIR DISCRÉTIONNAIRE LIMITÉ DE L'AGENT DE RENVOI\n[21]\nLa Cour a établi que les agents de renvoi ont un pouvoir discrétionnaire limité, qui se restreint à reporter le renvoi en raison de circonstances spéciales ou impérieuses.\n[37] Il est bien établi en droit que le pouvoir discrétionnaire de différer une mesure de renvoi est fort restreint. Il serait contraire aux buts et objectifs de la Loi d'étendre, au moyen d'une déclaration judiciaire, le pouvoir discrétionnaire restreint que possède l'agent chargé du renvoi, de façon à exiger un \"mini\" examen des raisons d'ordre humanitaire avant le renvoi ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphe 4 (1re inst.) ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1re inst.) (QL)) ...\n(Adviento, ci-dessus; Voir également: Simoes, ci-dessus; Williams, ci-dessus; Prasad, ci-dessus; Griffith, ci-dessus.)\n[22]\nLa demanderesse n'a pas démontré qu'elle avait soumis à l'agent de renvoi des éléments de preuve qui auraient pu constituer une justification suffisante permettant à l'agent d'exercer son pouvoir discrétionnaire, qui se restreint à reporter le renvoi\nen raison de circonstances spéciales ou impérieuses\n:\n[45] En l'instance, la mesure dont on demande de différer l'exécution est une mesure que le ministre a l'obligation d'exécuter selon la loi.\nLa décision de différer l'exécution doit donc comporter une justification pour ne pas se conformer à une obligation positive imposée par la loi\n. Cette justification doit se trouver dans la loi, ou dans une autre obligation juridique que le ministre doit respecter et qui est suffisamment importante pour l'autoriser à ne pas respecter l'article 48 de la Loi [sur l'immigration, L.R.C. (1985), ch. I-2]. (La Cour souligne.)\n(Wang, ci-dessus.)\n[23]\nLa demanderesse allègue tout simplement dans son affidavit que l'agente \"a refusé de surseoir au renvoi malgré qu'elle fut informé sur les procédure des parrainage en cours\". (Paragraphe 16, Affidavit de la demanderesse, page 12 du\nDossier de requête\n.)\n[24]\nIl est de droit constant qu'une demande pendante de parrainage n'est pas en soi un obstacle au renvoi.\n[52] Quant à la question soumise au contrôle judiciaire sous-jacent, le refus de l'agent chargé du renvoi de différer l'exécution du renvoi jusqu'à ce qu'on ait tranché la demande invoquant des motifs d'ordre humanitaire, je considère qu'il n'y a pas de question sérieuse à trancher au sujet de sa conduite. Comme je l'ai expliqué plus tôt, une demande pendante invoquant des motifs d'ordre humanitaire fondée sur la séparation d'avec la famille n'est pas en soi un motif de remettre un renvoi à plus tard. La traiter comme étant un tel motif aurait pour résultat de créer un sursis que le législateur n'a pas voulu inclure dans la  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, le juge Noël (alors juge à la Section de première instance)...\n(Wang, ci-dessus; Voir également:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 17 à 19 (1e inst.) (QL).)\n[25]\nLa demanderesse n'a de toute évidence soumis aucun élément de preuve qui aurait pu constituer une justification permettant à l'agent de renvoi de reporter le renvoi.\n[26]\nTenant compte de tout ce qui précède, la demanderesse a fait défaut de soulever une question sérieuse au soutien de sa requête. La demande d'un sursis de renvoi pourrait être rejetée pour ce seul motif.\nLA DEMANDERESSE NE BÉNÉFICIE PAS D'UN DÉLAI ADMINISTRATIF\n[27]\nLa demanderesse a été convoquée par lettre datée du 22 janvier 2007 à rencontrer un agent d'exécution de la LIPR, le 10 février 2007, afin de mettre à jour son dossier pour un éventuel renvoi du Canada. (Lettre de convocation à une entrevue préalable au renvoi, datée du 22 janvier 2007, pièce \"I\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[28]\nCe n'est que suite à cette lettre que la demanderesse a déposé une demande de résidence permanente à titre de conjoint au Canada. En fait la demande a été déposée le 9 février 2007.\n[29]\nLa demanderesse n'aurait pu bénéficier de la Politique que si sa demande de parrainage avait été déposée avant qu'elle ne soit convoquée à une rencontre:\nQuand un client est-il prêt au renvoi?\nPour l'application de cette politique d'intérêt public, au moment où le demandeur se présente à une entrevue préalable au renvoi, il est habituellement prêt au renvoi.\nCela signifie qu'un client qui a été convoqué à une entrevue préalable au renvoi d'une façon ou d'une autre (lettre, appel, etc.) et qui n'a pas encore présenté une demande CH en tant qu'époux ou à titre de membre de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada ne peut pas, à partir du moment où il a été convoqué à l'entrevue, bénéficier de la suspension administrative du renvoi décrite dans la présente Politique d'intérêt public\n, sauf dans les circonstances limitées énoncées ci-dessous (cas visés par les dispositions transitoires). (La Cour souligne.)\n(Page 60, \"\nF. SUSPENSION ADMINISTRATIVE DU RENVOI\n\", Appendice HPolitique d'intérêt public établie en vertu du paragraphe 25(1) de la LIPR pour faciliter le traitement selon les règles de la catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada,\nGuide IP8: Catégorie des époux ou conjoints de fait au Canada\n, pièce \"J\" de l'affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[30]\nLa demanderesse n'était donc pas éligible à la politique, puisque sa demande a été déposée après qu'elle ait été convoquée pour l'entrevue préalable au renvoi. Qui plus est, le sursis administratif est d'une durée de 60 jours et, eut-il été applicable, serait aujourd'hui expiré.\nPRÉJUDICE IRRÉPARABLE\n[31]\nLa notion de préjudice irréparable a été définie par la Cour dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 15 (QL) (1re inst.), comme étant\nle renvoi d'une personne vers un pays où il existe un danger pour sa vie et sa sécurité\n.\n[32]\nLe juge Sandra J. Simpson dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 22 (QL) mentionnait d'ailleurs ce qui suit relativement à la définition du préjudice irréparable établie dans Kerrutt, ci-dessus:\n[22] Dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.F. 1re inst.), le juge MacKay avait conclu que, dans le cadre d'une demande de sursis à exécution,\nla notion de préjudice irréparable sous-entend un risque grave de quelque chose qui met en cause la vie ou la sécurité d'un requérant. Le critère est très exigeant\net j'admets son principe de base selon lequel\non entend par préjudice irréparable quelque chose de très grave\n, c'est-à-dire\nquelque chose de plus grave que les regrettables difficultés\nauxquelles vont donner lieu une séparation familiale ou un départ. (La Cour souligne.)\n[33]\nLa demanderesse reprend en partie les faits qui avaient déjà été allégués au niveau de la demande d'asile et de la demande ERAR concernant son homosexualité alléguée alors qu'elle habitait au Mexique.\n[34]\nLa SPR a rejeté la demande d'asile de la demanderesse le 6 janvier 2005, en concluant qu'elle ne croyait pas aux allégations de la demanderesse. La demanderesse n'a pas déposé de DACJ à l'encontre de cette décision. (Motifs de la SPR, pièce \"E\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[35]\nD'autre part, les risques soulevés par la demanderesse dans sa demande ERAR sont basés sur les allégations entourant son homosexualité alors qu'elle était au Mexique. Elle ne veut pas retourner au Mexique et revivre ce qu'elle a enduré.\n[36]\nL'agent ERAR a conclu que la demanderesse n'était pas à risque advenant un retour au Mexique. (Motifs ERAR, pièce \"D\" de l'Affidavit de Francine Lauzé.)\n[37]\nLa demanderesse explique qu'elle réalise aujourd'hui qu'elle n'aurait pas été réellement homosexuelle, mais qu'elle agissait ainsi pour faire preuve d'excentricité. Par ailleurs, elle est aujourd'hui ouvertement, et à la connaissance de sa famille, dans une relation avec un homme.\n[38]\nLa demanderesse ne peut, dans le cadre d'une requête en sursis de la mesure de renvoi, alléguer les mêmes risques qui ont été rejetés au niveau de la SPR et de l'ERAR.\n[2] ... Bien plus, ses allégations, à cet égard, sont en substance les mêmes que celles invoquées lors de sa revendication du statut de réfugié devant la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de réfugié. Ses allégations ayant alors été évaluées et rejetées parce que non crédibles ne peuvent servir de base à une allégation de préjudice irréparable (voir, par exemple,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2003 CF 931).\n(Dimouamoua c.Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration), 2005 CF 940, [2005] A.C.F. no 1172 (QL).)\n[39]\nLa demanderesse allègue par ailleurs au soutien de sa requête en sursis que son conjoint étant musulman, ses parents l'ont renié et qu'elle craint pour son \"avenir, réputation et sécurité\" si elle devait retourner au Mexique. (Paragraphes 28 et 30, Affidavit de la demanderesse, page 13 du\nDossier de requête\n.)\n[40]\nCes allégations de la demanderesse sont vagues et ne fournissent aucun détail sur les préjudices irréparables qu'elle subirait si elle devait retourner au Mexique. Il n'est pas clair si ces risques seraient en raison du fait que son conjoint est musulman ou lié à ses allégations d'homosexualité.\n[41]\nPour ces raisons, le préjudice allégué est purement spéculatif:\n[7] Deuxièmement, l'allégation d'un préjudice irréparable ne doit pas être une simple hypothèse ni être fondée sur une série de possibilités. La Cour doit être convaincue que ce préjudice surviendra si la réparation sollicitée n'est pas accordée: Atakora, précitée, au paragraphe 12;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2001 CFPI 325, au paragraphe 15.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] A.C.F. no 1182 (QL).)\nCONJOINT DE LA DEMANDERESSE\n[42]\nLe conjoint de la demanderesse a indiqué dans son affidavit qu'il ne pourrait aller vivre au Mexique avec la demanderesse, sa famille les ayant reniés.\n[43]\nDe plus, il invoque les engagements financiers que lui et la demanderesse ont pris ensemble et qu'il lui serait impossible de payer ces dettes à lui seul.\n[44]\nLes problèmes soulevés par le conjoint de la demanderesse sont des conséquences normales d'un renvoi. De plus, aucun détails ni preuve ne sont fournis sur ces engagements.\n[45]\nPar ailleurs, aucun détail sur la relation n'est soumis à la Cour.\n[46]\nIl est de droit constant que la séparation de la famille n'est pas en soi un préjudice irréparable puisqu'il s'agit d'une conséquence normale d'un renvoi.\n[3] Deuxièmement, la séparation de la famille ne constitue pas, en soi, un préjudice irréparable, parce qu'il s'agit d'une conséquence normale de l'expulsion (voir, par exemple:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). La situation du demandeur ne diffère en rien des autres situations d'expulsion.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] A.C.F. no 1679, par. 3 (QL); Voir aussi:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 10 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 24 (QL).)\n[47]\nLa séparation d'avec un conjoint n'est pas le type de préjudice auquel le test tri-partite fait référence pour l'obtention d'un sursis. Ainsi que le mentionnait le  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1e inst.) (QL):\n[21] Ce sont là les conséquences déplaisantes et désagréables d'une expulsion. Mais pour que l'expression \"préjudice irréparable\" conserve un peu de sens, elle doit correspondre à un préjudice au-delà de ce qui est inhérent à la notion même d'expulsion. Être expulsé veut dire perdre son emploi, être séparé des gens et des endroits connus. L'expulsion s'accompagne de séparations forcées et de coeurs brisés. Il n'y a rien de plus dans la situation de M. Melo que les conséquences normales d'une expulsion.\n[48]\nUltimement, la demanderesse et son conjoint connaissaient le statut précaire de la demanderesse lorsqu'ils auraient pris des engagements financiers, qui n'ont par ailleurs pas été prouvés devant la Cour, et ont pris leurs décisions en toute connaissance de cause. Dans les termes du Juge Paul Rouleau, ils l'ont fait à leurs propres risques:\n[16] Je ne vois pas en quoi le ministre aurait agi irrégulièrement ou aurait suscité des attentes chez le demandeur; si celui-ci a décidé de se marier alors que sa situation n'avait pas encore fait l'objet d'une décision favorable de la part des autorités canadiennes, c'est à ses propres risques, et non à ceux du ministre qui a l'obligation de faire respecter les lois du  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1e inst.) (QL).)\n[49]\nPar conséquent, et en l'absence d'une question sérieuse à être tranchée par cette Cour, la demanderesse n'a pas démontré l'existence d'un préjudice irréparable.\nBALANCE DES INCONVÉNIENTS\n[50]\nEn plus de démontrer que la DACJ sous-jacente soulève une question sérieuse à trancher et qu'elle subira un préjudice irréparable s'il n'y a pas de sursis à son renvoi, la personne qui demande un sursis doit établir que, eu égard à toutes les circonstances, la prépondérance des inconvénients favorise l'octroi du sursis. (Manitoba (Procureur général) c. Metropolitan Ltd., ci-dessus; R.J.R.   <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Toth, ci-dessus.)\n[51]\nPour déterminer la prépondérance des inconvénients, la Cour doit décider laquelle des deux parties subira le plus grand préjudice selon que l'on accorde ou refuse le sursis. (Manitoba (Procureur général) c. Metropolitan Ltd., ci-dessus.)\n[52]\nEn l'absence de questions sérieuses et de préjudice irréparable, la balance des inconvénients favorise le Ministre, qui a intérêt à ce que l'ordonnance de renvoi soit exécutée à la date qu'il a fixée. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 2 (QL).)\n[53]\nEn effet, le paragraphe 48(2) de la Loi prévoit qu'une mesure de renvoi doit être exécutée dès que les circonstances le permettent.\n48(1)\nMesure de renvoi\n- La mesure de renvoi est exécutoire depuis sa prise d'effet dès lors qu'elle ne fait pas l'objet d'un sursis.\n48(2)\nConséquence\n- L'étranger visé par la mesure de renvoi exécutoire doit immédiatement quitter le territoire du Canada, la mesure devant être appliquée dès que les circonstances le permettent.\n[54]\nLe juge Barbara Reed, dans l'affaire  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  par. 18 (QL), a d'ailleurs élaboré sur la question de la balance des inconvénients en matière de sursis, et de l'intérêt public qui doit être pris en considération:\n[18] Cependant, d'après la prépondérance des inconvénients, il faut se demander à quel point le fait d'accorder des sursis risque de devenir une pratique qui contrecarre l'application efficace de la législation en matière d'immigration. Chacun sait que la procédure actuelle a été mise en place parce qu'une pratique s'était développée par laquelle de très nombreuses demandes, tout a fait dénuées de fondement, étaient introduites devant la Cour et encombraient les rôles, uniquement pour permettre aux appelants de demeurer plus longtemps au Canada. Il y va de l'intérêt public d'avoir un régime qui fonctionne de façon efficace, rapide et équitable, et qui, dans la mesure du possible, ne se prête pas aux abus. Tel est, à mon avis, l'intérêt public qu'il faut soupeser par rapport au préjudice que pourrait éventuellement subir le requérant si un sursis n'était pas accordé.\n[55]\nLa balance des inconvénients penche en faveur du Ministre.\nCONCLUSION\n[56]\nPour l'ensemble de ces motifs, la demande de sursis d'exécution de la mesure de renvoi est rejetée.\nJUGEMENT\n[57]\nLA COUR ORDONNE que\nla demande de sursis d'exécution de la mesure de renvoi soit rejetée.\n.........................\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Court has established that removals officers have limited discretion to defer a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n.\n[37] It is well-established law that the discretion to defer a removal is very limited. It would be contrary to the purposes and objects to the Act to expand, by judicial declaration, a removal officer's limited discretion so as to mandate a \"mini H&C\" review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 4 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 45 (QL), 2003 FC 1430; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 12 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J. No. 1133, paragraph 21 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 805, paragraph 32 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 182, paragraph 26 (QL).)\n[2]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that she had submitted evidence to the removals officer that could constitute sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to deferring a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n:\n[45] The order whose deferral is in issue is a mandatory order which the Minister is bound by law to execute.\nThe exercise of deferral requires justification for failing to obey a positive obligation imposed by statute\n. That justification must be found in the statute or in some other legal obligation imposed on the Minister which is of sufficient importance to relieve the Minister from compliance with section 48 of the Act [Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1-2]. (Emphasis added.)\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 295, paragraph 45 (QL))\nINTRODUCTION\n[3]\nThe applicant, a Mexican citizen, has brought a motion to stay the removal order against her. The motion is attached to an application for leave and judicial review (ALJR) of the removals officer's refusal to defer her removal.\n[4]\nA motion for a stay of the removal order was also filed in docket IMM-2603-07, attached to an ALJR of the negative decision dated on May 17, 2007, on the applicant's application for a pre-removal risk assessment.\nFACTS\n[5]\nThe applicant is a Mexican citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada on June 22, 2004 (page 2, \"Risks identified by the Applicant\", Notes to file Pre-removal Risk Assessment, (PRRA Reasons), Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n[6]\nThe applicant alleges that she is afraid in her country because of her homosexuality. (See the Reasons for Decision issued January 6, 2005, by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), Exhibit E to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\n[7]\nThe RPD of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) heard the refugee claim on January 6, 2005, and refused it because the applicant lacked credibility. The applicant did not file an ALJR of that decision.\n[8]\nThe applicant applied for a pre-removal risk assessment on February 25, 2007 (application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA Application), Exhibit F to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé). A negative decision was issued on May 17, 2007 (PRRA Reasons, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n[9]\nThe applicant is currently in a common-law relationship with a man, according to the affidavits of the applicant and her spouse, and applied for permanent residence as a spouse in Canada on February 9, 2007.\n[10]\nThe negative decision on the PRRA application was sent to the applicant on June 9, 2007. An ALJR of that decision was filed on June 28, 2007, in docket IMM-2603-07. (See \"Notice of Interview for June 9, 2007\", Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé and after \"Officer's Notes dated June 9, 2007\", Exhibit B to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\n[11]\nAt the meeting on June 9, 2007, the applicant received a letter telling her that she had to go to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) no later than July 4, 2007, in possession of a plane ticket with a departure date of July 13, 2007, or earlier.\n[12]\nThe applicant\nfailed to appear on July 4, 2007\n, and the CBSA issued an arrest warrant against the applicant. Because the applicant had not shown up, no departure date could be set. (See the note to file signed by Éric Gagnon, dated 05-07-2007, Exhibit L to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\n[13]\nOn July 4, 2007, the applicant served and filed motions for stays of the removal order in this docket and in docket IMM-2603-07.\n[14]\nOn July 6, 2007, the applicant finally went to the CBSA offices and since she had in her possession a plane ticket for July 13, 2007, the departure date was scheduled for July 13, 2007. (See the \"Officer's Notes\", dated July 6, 2007, Exhibit G to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé and the confirmation of the departure date of July 13, 2007, dated July 6, 2007, Exhibit H to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\nANALYSIS\n[15]\nIn order to assess the merits of the stay motion, this Court must determine whether the applicant meets the tests delineated by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).\n[16]\nIn that case, the Federal Court of Appeal adopted three tests that it imported from the case law on injunctions, specifically the Supreme Court of Canada decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The three tests are\n(1) serious issue;\n(2) irreparable harm; and\n(3) assessment of the balance of convenience.\n[17]\nAll three tests must be met for this Court to grant the stay. If one of them is not satisfied, the Court cannot grant the stay.\n[18]\nIn this case, the applicant has not demonstrated that there is a serious issue to be tried on the ALJR of the officer's decision on the application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; she has not established irreparable harm and, last, the inconvenience to the applicant is not superior to the public interest in having the removal order enforced as soon as is practicable in accordance with paragraph 48(2) of the IRPA.\nSERIOUS ISSUE\n[19]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried by this Court.\n[20]\nThe applicant must show that she has a reasonable chance of succeeding on her main application, i.e., the ALJR of the officer's decision.\nLIMITED DISCRETION OF REMOVALS OFFICER\n[21]\nThe Court has established that removals officers have limited discretion to defer a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n.\n[37] It is well-established law that the discretion to defer a removal is very limited. It would be contrary to the purposes and objects to the Act to expand, by judicial declaration, a removal officer's limited discretion so as to mandate a \"mini H&C\" review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 4 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Griffith, above.)\n[22]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that she had submitted evidence to the removals officer that could constitute sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to deferring a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n:\n[45] The order whose deferral is in issue is a mandatory order which the Minister is bound by law to execute.\nThe exercise of deferral requires justification for failing to obey a positive obligation imposed by statute.\nThat justification must be found in the statute or in some other legal obligation imposed on the Minister which is of sufficient importance to relieve the Minister from compliance with section 48 of the Act [Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1-2]. (Emphasis added.)\n(Wang, above)\n[23]\nThe applicant simply states in her affidavit that the officer [translation] \"refused to stay the removal despite the fact that I told him about the ongoing sponsorship proceedings\" (paragraph 16, Affidavit of the Applicant, page 12 of the Motion Record).\n[24]\nIt is settled law that a pending sponsorship application is not per se an obstacle to removal.\n[52] Turning to the issue in the underlying judicial review, the Removal Officer's refusal to defer the removal pending the disposition of the H & C application, I find no serious issue with regard to the Removal Officer's conduct. As set out above, a pending H & C application on grounds of family separation is not itself grounds for delaying a removal. To treat it as such would be to create a statutory stay which Parliament declined to enact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, per Noël J. (as he then was).\n(Wang, above; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphs 17 to 19 (T.D.) (QL).)\n[25]\nThe applicant clearly did not submit any evidence that could constitute justification for the removals officer to defer the removal.\n[26]\nConsidering all of the foregoing, the applicant failed to raise a serious issue in support of her motion. The motion for a stay of removal could be dismissed on this ground alone.\nTHE APPLICANT NOT ENTITLED TO ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERRAL\n[27]\nThe applicant was invited by letter dated January 22, 2007, to meet with an IRPA enforcement officer on February 10, 2007, to bring her file up-to-date for a possible removal from Canada (interview letter for pre-removal interview, dated January 22, 2007, Exhibit I to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n[28]\nIt was only after receiving the letter that the applicant submitted an application for permanent residence as a spouse in Canada. In fact, the application was filed on February 9, 2007.\n[29]\nThe applicant could only have benefited from the policy if her sponsorship application had been submitted before she was invited to an interview:\nWhen is a client removal ready?\nFor the purposes of this public policy, by the time an applicant attends a pre-removal interview, he/she is generally removal ready.\nThis means that a client who has been called to a pre-removal interview by any means (letter, call etc.) and who has not already applied as a spousal H&C applicant or a Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada class applicant, cannot, from the point they are called to the interview forward, benefit from an administrative deferral of removal as outlined in this public policy\nexcept in the limited circumstances outlined below (transitional cases). (Emphasis added.)\n(page 60, \"F. ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERRAL OF REMOVAL\", Appendix HPublic Policy Under 25(1) of IRPA to Facilitate Processing in accordance with the Regulations of the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class, Manual IP8: Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class, Exhibit J to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé)\n[30]\nThe applicant was, therefore, not eligible for the policy since her application was submitted after she had been invited to the pre-removal interview. Moreover, the administrative deferral lasts for 60 days and, if it had been applicable, would have expired by now.\nIRREPARABLE HARM\n[31]\nThe Court defined irreparable harm in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 15 (QL) (T.D.) as\nreturning a person to a country where his safety or his life is in jeopardy\n.\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 22 (QL), Madam Justice Sandra J. Simpson stated the following about the definition of irreparable harm in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> :\n[22]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, for the purposes of a stay application,\nirreparable harm implies the serious likelihood of jeopardy to an applicant's life or safety. This is a very strict test\nand I accept its premise that\nirreparable harm must be very grave and more than the unfortunate hardship\nassociated with the breakup or relocation of a family. (Emphasis added.)\n[33]\nThe applicant repeats in part what she already stated in the refugee claim and the PRRA application about her alleged homosexuality while she was living in Mexico.\n[34]\nThe RPD denied the applicant's refugee claim on January 6, 2005, and concluded that it did not believe the applicant's allegations. The applicant did not file an ALJR of that decision (RPD Reasons, Exhibit E to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n[35]\nOn the other hand, the risks identified by the applicant on her PRRA application are based on allegations about her homosexuality when she was living in Mexico. She does not want to return to Mexico and relive what she endured.\n[36]\nThe PRRA officer found that the applicant would not be at risk should she return to Mexico (PRRA Reasons, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n[37]\nThe applicant explained that she now realizes that she was not really homosexual but that she acted that way to show that she was eccentric. Besides, she is now openly, and with her family's knowledge, in a relationship with a man.\n[38]\nOn a motion for a stay of a removal order, an applicant cannot allege the same risks that were dismissed at the RPD and PRRA stages.\n[2] . . . Moreover, his allegations on that point are substantially the same as the ones raised when his claim was before the Immigration and Refugee Board.

No. 1172 (QL))\n[39]\nIn support of her stay motion, the applicant also states that her spouse is a Muslim, that his parents have disowned him and that she fears for her [translation] \"future, reputation and safety\" if returned to Mexico (paragraphs 28 and 30, Affidavit of the Applicant, page 13 of the Motion Record).\n[40]\nThese allegations of the applicant are vague and provide no details about the irreparable harm she would suffer if returned to Mexico. It is not clear whether the risks would stem from the fact that her spouse is a Muslim or whether they are connected to her homosexuality allegations.\n[41]\nFor these reasons, the alleged harm is purely speculative:\n[7] Second, irreparable harm must not be speculative nor can it be based on a series of possibilities. The Court must be satisfied that the irreparable harm will occur if the relief sought is not granted: Atakora, supra, at para. 12;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2001 FCT 325 at para. 15).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1182 (QL))\nAPPLICANT'S SPOUSE\n[42]\nThe applicant's spouse states in his affidavit that he could not go to live with the applicant in Mexico because his family has disowned them.\n[43]\nHe also relies on the financial commitments that he and the applicant have entered into together and states that it would be impossible to pay these debts on his own.\n[44]\nThe problems raised by the applicant's spouse are the normal consequences of removal. In addition, no details or evidence about these commitments were provided.\n[45]\nMoreover, no details about the relationship were submitted to the Court.\n[46]\nIt is settled law that family separation per se is not irreparable harm because it is within the normal consequences of removal.\n[3] Second, family separation per se is not irreparable harm because it is within the normal consequences of deportation (see, i.e.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). There is nothing about the applicant's case which takes it beyond the usual result of deportation.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J.

No. 1161, paragraph 10 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 24 (QL).)\n[47]\nSeparation from a spouse is not the type of harm referred to in the tripartite test to obtain a stay. As stated by Mr. Justice Denis Pelletier in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL):\n[21] These are all unpleasant and distasteful consequences of deportation. But if the phrase irreparable harm is to retain any meaning at all, it must refer to some prejudice beyond that which is inherent in the notion of deportation itself. To be deported is to lose your job, to be separated from familiar faces and places. It is accompanied by enforced separation and heartbreak. There is nothing in Mr. Melo's circumstances which takes it out of the usual consequences of deportation.\n[48]\nUltimately, the applicant and her spouse were aware of her precarious status when they took on the financial commitments, which were, moreover, not in evidence before the Court, and they made their decisions with full knowledge of the situation. In the words of Mr. Justice Paul Rouleau, they did so at their peril:\n[16] I see no transgressions in the conduct of the Minister; no expectations granted the applicant; if he chose to marry while still not having his situation favourably determined by Canadian authorities, it is at his peril, not that of the Minister who has a duty to uphold the laws of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL))\n[49]\nConsequently, absent a serious issue to be tried by this Court, the applicant has not demonstrated irreparable harm.\nBALANCE OF CONVENIENCE\n[50]\nIn addition to demonstrating that the underlying ALJR raises a serious issue to be tried and that he or she will suffer irreparable harm if the removal is not stayed, the person requesting a stay must establish that, having regard to all the circumstances, the balance of convenience favours granting the stay ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ).\n[51]\nIn determining the balance of convenience, the Court must decide which of the two parties will suffer the greater harm from the grant or refusal of the stay ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 2 (QL)).\n[53]\nSubsection 48(2) of the Act provides that a removal order must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n48 (1)\nEnforceable Removal Order -\nA removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.\n48(2)\nEffect -\nIf a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n[54]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 18 (QL), Madam Justice Barbara Reed elaborated on the issue of balance of convenience on stay motions and the public interest that must be taken into consideration:\n[18] What is in issue, however, when considering balance of convenience, is the extent to which the granting of stays might become a practice which thwarts the efficient operation of the immigration legislation. It is well known that the present procedures were put in place because a practice had grown up in which many many cases, totally devoid of merit, were initiated in the court, indeed were clogging the court, for the sole purpose of buying the appellants further time in Canada. There is a public interest in having a system which operates in an efficient, expeditious and fair manner and which, to the greatest extent possible, does not lend itself to abusive practices. This is the public interest which in my view must be weighed against the potential harm to the applicant if a stay is not granted.\n[55]\nThe balance of convenience favours the Minister.\nCONCLUSION\n[56]\nFor all these reasons, the motion for a stay of the removal order is dismissed.\n[57]\nTHE COURT ORDERS that\nthe motion for a stay of the removal order is dismissed.\n[End of document]",

(Emphasis added.)\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2001] F.C.J. No. 295, paragraph 45 (QL))\nINTRODUCTION\n\n[3]\nThe applicant, a Mexican citizen, has brought a motion to stay the removal order against her. The motion is attached to an application for leave and judicial review (ALJR) of the removals officer's refusal to defer her removal.\n\n[4]\nA motion for a stay of the removal order was also filed in docket IMM-2603-07, attached to an ALJR of the negative decision dated on May 17, 2007, on the applicant's application for a pre-removal risk assessment.\nFACTS\n\n[5]\nThe applicant is a Mexican citizen who claimed refugee status in Canada on June 22, 2004 (page 2, \"Risks identified by the Applicant\", Notes to file Pre-removal Risk Assessment, (PRRA Reasons), Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n\n[6]\nThe applicant alleges that she is afraid in her country because of her homosexuality. (See the Reasons for Decision issued January 6, 2005, by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), Exhibit E to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\n\n[7]\nThe RPD of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) heard the refugee claim on January 6, 2005, and refused it because the applicant lacked credibility. The applicant did not file an ALJR of that decision.\n\n[8]\nThe applicant applied for a pre-removal risk assessment on February 25, 2007 (application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA Application), Exhibit F to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé). A negative decision was issued on May 17, 2007 (PRRA Reasons, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n\n[9]\nThe applicant is currently in a common-law relationship with a man, according to the affidavits of the applicant and her spouse, and applied for permanent residence as a spouse in Canada on February 9, 2007.\n\n[10]\nThe negative decision on the PRRA application was sent to the applicant on June 9, 2007. An ALJR of that decision was filed on June 28, 2007, in docket IMM-2603-07. (See \"Notice of Interview for June 9, 2007\", Exhibit A to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé and after \"Officer's Notes dated June 9, 2007\", Exhibit B to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\n\n[11]\nAt the meeting on June 9, 2007, the applicant received a letter telling her that she had to go to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) no later than July 4, 2007, in possession of a plane ticket with a departure date of July 13, 2007, or earlier.\n\n[12]\nThe applicant\nfailed to appear on July 4, 2007\n, and the CBSA issued an arrest warrant against the applicant. Because the applicant had not shown up, no departure date could be set. (See the note to file signed by Éric Gagnon, dated 05-07-2007, Exhibit L to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\n\n[13]\nOn July 4, 2007, the applicant served and filed motions for stays of the removal order in this docket and in docket IMM-2603-07.\n\n[14]\nOn July 6, 2007, the applicant finally went to the CBSA offices and since she had in her possession a plane ticket for July 13, 2007, the departure date was scheduled for July 13, 2007. (See the \"Officer's Notes\", dated July 6, 2007, Exhibit G to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé and the confirmation of the departure date of July 13, 2007, dated July 6, 2007, Exhibit H to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé.)\nANALYSIS\n\n[15]\nIn order to assess the merits of the stay motion, this Court must determine whether the applicant meets the tests delineated by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.).\n\n[16]\nIn that case, the Federal Court of Appeal adopted three tests that it imported from the case law on injunctions, specifically the Supreme Court of Canada decision in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The three tests are\n(1) serious issue;\n(2) irreparable harm; and\n(3) assessment of the balance of convenience.\n\n[17]\nAll three tests must be met for this Court to grant the stay. If one of them is not satisfied, the Court cannot grant the stay.\n\n[18]\nIn this case, the applicant has not demonstrated that there is a serious issue to be tried on the ALJR of the officer's decision on the application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; she has not established irreparable harm and, last, the inconvenience to the applicant is not superior to the public interest in having the removal order enforced as soon as is practicable in accordance with paragraph 48(2) of the IRPA.\nSERIOUS ISSUE\n\n[19]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be tried by this Court.\n\n[20]\nThe applicant must show that she has a reasonable chance of succeeding on her main application, i.e., the ALJR of the officer's decision.\nLIMITED DISCRETION OF REMOVALS OFFICER\n\n[21]\nThe Court has established that removals officers have limited discretion to defer a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n. [37] It is well-established law that the discretion to defer a removal is very limited. It would be contrary to the purposes and objects to the Act to expand, by judicial declaration, a removal officer's limited discretion so as to mandate a \"mini H&C\" review prior to removal ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 4 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) (QL).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Griffith, above.)\n\n[22]\nThe applicant did not demonstrate that she had submitted evidence to the removals officer that could constitute sufficient justification for the officer to exercise his discretion, which is limited to deferring a removal\nby reason of special or compelling circumstances\n: [45] The order whose deferral is in issue is a mandatory order which the Minister is bound by law to execute.\nThe exercise of deferral requires justification for failing to obey a positive obligation imposed by statute.\nThat justification must be found in the statute or in some other legal obligation imposed on the Minister which is of sufficient importance to relieve the Minister from compliance with section 48 of the Act [Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1-2]. (Emphasis added.)\n(Wang, above)\n\n[23]\nThe applicant simply states in her affidavit that the officer [translation] \"refused to stay the removal despite the fact that I told him about the ongoing sponsorship proceedings\" (paragraph 16, Affidavit of the Applicant, page 12 of the Motion Record).\n\n[24]\nIt is settled law that a pending sponsorship application is not per se an obstacle to removal. [52] Turning to the issue in the underlying judicial review, the Removal Officer's refusal to defer the removal pending the disposition of the H & C application, I find no serious issue with regard to the Removal Officer's conduct. As set out above, a pending H & C application on grounds of family separation is not itself grounds for delaying a removal. To treat it as such would be to create a statutory stay which Parliament declined to enact.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134, per Noël J. (as he then was).\n(Wang, above; See also:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraphs 17 to 19 (T.D.) (QL).)\n\n[25]\nThe applicant clearly did not submit any evidence that could constitute justification for the removals officer to defer the removal.\n\n[26]\nConsidering all of the foregoing, the applicant failed to raise a serious issue in support of her motion. The motion for a stay of removal could be dismissed on this ground alone.\nTHE APPLICANT NOT ENTITLED TO ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERRAL\n\n[27]\nThe applicant was invited by letter dated January 22, 2007, to meet with an IRPA enforcement officer on February 10, 2007, to bring her file up-to-date for a possible removal from Canada (interview letter for pre-removal interview, dated January 22, 2007, Exhibit I to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n\n[28]\nIt was only after receiving the letter that the applicant submitted an application for permanent residence as a spouse in Canada. In fact, the application was filed on February 9, 2007.\n\n[29]\nThe applicant could only have benefited from the policy if her sponsorship application had been submitted before she was invited to an interview:\nWhen is a client removal ready?\nFor the purposes of this public policy, by the time an applicant attends a pre-removal interview, he/she is generally removal ready.\nThis means that a client who has been called to a pre-removal interview by any means (letter, call etc.) and who has not already applied as a spousal H&C applicant or a Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada class applicant, cannot, from the point they are called to the interview forward, benefit from an administrative deferral of removal as outlined in this public policy\nexcept in the limited circumstances outlined below (transitional cases). (Emphasis added.)\n(page 60, \"F. ADMINISTRATIVE DEFERRAL OF REMOVAL\", Appendix HPublic Policy Under 25(1) of IRPA to Facilitate Processing in accordance with the Regulations of the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class, Manual IP8: Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class, Exhibit J to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé)\n\n[30]\nThe applicant was, therefore, not eligible for the policy since her application was submitted after she had been invited to the pre-removal interview. Moreover, the administrative deferral lasts for 60 days and, if it had been applicable, would have expired by now.\nIRREPARABLE HARM\n\n[31]\nThe Court defined irreparable harm in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 15 (QL) (T.D.) as\nreturning a person to a country where his safety or his life is in jeopardy\n.\n\n[32]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 22 (QL), Madam Justice Sandra J. Simpson stated the following about the definition of irreparable harm in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> : [22]  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.) Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, for the purposes of a stay application,\nirreparable harm implies the serious likelihood of jeopardy to an applicant's life or safety. This is a very strict test\nand I accept its premise that\nirreparable harm must be very grave and more than the unfortunate hardship\nassociated with the breakup or relocation of a family. (Emphasis added.)\n\n[33]\nThe applicant repeats in part what she already stated in the refugee claim and the PRRA application about her alleged homosexuality while she was living in Mexico.\n\n[34]\nThe RPD denied the applicant's refugee claim on January 6, 2005, and concluded that it did not believe the applicant's allegations. The applicant did not file an ALJR of that decision (RPD Reasons, Exhibit E to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n\n[35]\nOn the other hand, the risks identified by the applicant on her PRRA application are based on allegations about her homosexuality when she was living in Mexico. She does not want to return to Mexico and relive what she endured.\n\n[36]\nThe PRRA officer found that the applicant would not be at risk should she return to Mexico (PRRA Reasons, Exhibit D to the Affidavit of Francine Lauzé).\n\n[37]\nThe applicant explained that she now realizes that she was not really homosexual but that she acted that way to show that she was eccentric. Besides, she is now openly, and with her family's knowledge, in a relationship with a man.\n\n[38]\nOn a motion for a stay of a removal order, an applicant cannot allege the same risks that were dismissed at the RPD and PRRA stages. [2] . . . Moreover, his allegations on that point are substantially the same as the ones raised when his claim was before the Immigration and Refugee Board. His allegations then assessed and dismissed because they were not crediblecannot be the basis of an allegation of irreparable harm (see, for example,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2003 FC 931).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1172 (QL))\n\n[39]\nIn support of her stay motion, the applicant also states that her spouse is a Muslim, that his parents have disowned him and that she fears for her [translation] \"future, reputation and safety\" if returned to Mexico (paragraphs 28 and 30, Affidavit of the Applicant, page 13 of the Motion Record).\n\n[40]\nThese allegations of the applicant are vague and provide no details about the irreparable harm she would suffer if returned to Mexico. It is not clear whether the risks would stem from the fact that her spouse is a Muslim or whether they are connected to her homosexuality allegations.\n\n[41]\nFor these reasons, the alleged harm is purely speculative: [7] Second, irreparable harm must not be speculative nor can it be based on a series of possibilities. The Court must be satisfied that the irreparable harm will occur if the relief sought is not granted: Atakora, supra, at para. 12;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  2001 FCT 325 at para. 15).\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2003] F.C.J. No. 1182 (QL))\nAPPLICANT'S SPOUSE\n\n[42]\nThe applicant's spouse states in his affidavit that he could not go to live with the applicant in Mexico because his family has disowned them.\n\n[43]\nHe also relies on the financial commitments that he and the applicant have entered into together and states that it would be impossible to pay these debts on his own.\n\n[44]\nThe problems raised by the applicant's spouse are the normal consequences of removal. In addition, no details or evidence about these commitments were provided.\n\n[45]\nMoreover, no details about the relationship were submitted to the Court.\n\n[46]\nIt is settled law that family separation per se is not irreparable harm because it is within the normal consequences of removal. [3] Second, family separation per se is not irreparable harm because it is within the normal consequences of deportation (see, i.e.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL)). There is nothing about the applicant's case which takes it beyond the usual result of deportation.\n( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2002] F.C.J.

No. 1161, paragraph 10 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 24 (QL).)\n\n[47]\nSeparation from a spouse is not the type of harm referred to in the tripartite test to obtain a stay.

(<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> par. 2 (QL).)\n\n[53]\nSubsection 48(2) of the Act provides that a removal order must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n48 (1)\nEnforceable Removal Order -\nA removal order is enforceable if it has come into force and is not stayed.\n48(2)\nEffect -\nIf a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable.\n\n[54]\n <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  paragraph 18 (QL), Madam Justice Barbara Reed elaborated on the issue of balance of convenience on stay motions and the public interest that must be taken into consideration: [18] What is in issue, however, when considering balance of convenience, is the extent to which the granting of stays might become a practice which thwarts the efficient operation of the immigration legislation.

        "The applicant did not submit sufficient evidence to justify deferral of removal based on special or compelling circumstances.",
        "A pending sponsorship application is not, in itself, grounds for delaying removal.",
        "The applicant's claims of risk in Mexico, previously dismissed by the Refugee Protection Division and the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment officer, are not credible and cannot form the basis of irreparable harm.",
        "The applicant's alleged harm is speculative and lacks detail.",
        "Family separation is a normal consequence of removal and does not constitute irreparable harm.",
        "The applicant and her spouse were aware of her precarious immigration status when they entered into financial commitments.",
        "The applicant was not eligible for administrative deferral because she applied for permanent residence *after* being invited to a pre-removal interview.",
        "Enforcing the removal order is in the public interest and consistent with the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act."

    "court_analysis": [
      "The court reaffirmed the limited discretion of removal officers, stating it extends only to postponing removal due to 'special or compelling circumstances' and that expanding this discretion via judicial declaration would be contrary to the Immigration Act's purpose.",
      "The court applied the three-part test for granting a stay – serious issue, irreparable harm, and balance of convenience – established in prior Federal Court of Appeal case law (drawing from Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence on injunctions). All three tests must be met for a stay to be granted.",
      "The court found the applicant failed to demonstrate a 'serious issue' because she did not present evidence suggesting the removal officer acted improperly in refusing to defer removal, particularly regarding the application for humanitarian and compassionate grounds. A pending sponsorship application does not automatically preclude removal.",
      "The court determined the applicant did not establish 'irreparable harm'. It distinguished between hardship resulting from removal and the 'serious likelihood of jeopardy to life or safety' required for irreparable harm, noting the applicant's previous claims regarding her sexual orientation were not credible and her current claims were vague and speculative.",
      "The court rejected the argument based on the applicant’s spouse’s situation, finding that family separation is a normal consequence of deportation and does not, in itself, constitute irreparable harm. The couple knowingly entered financial commitments while aware of the applicant’s precarious immigration status.",
      "Because the applicant failed to meet the 'serious issue' and 'irreparable harm' tests, the court did not need to fully analyze the 'balance of convenience,' but it noted that the balance favored the Minister, who has a statutory duty to enforce removal orders 'as soon as is reasonably practicable.'",
      "The court emphasized the public interest in preventing abuse of the court system through frivolous stay applications designed to delay removal and emphasized that the applicant's case did not present a situation warranting an exception to the standard enforcement of removal orders."

    "final_outcome": [
      "The motion for a stay of the removal order is dismissed.",
